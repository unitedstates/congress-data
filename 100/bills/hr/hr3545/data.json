Revises the schedule for the payment of estimated tax installments. Specifies that the amount of the required annual estimated tax payment shall be the lesser of: (1) 90 percent of the current tax shown on the taxpayer's return (corporations having a taxable income of at least $1,000,000 for any taxable year during a specified period must use this option); or (2) 100 percent of the preceding year's tax liability. Permits lower estimated tax payments if the taxpayer can show that the installment payments or adjusted seasonal installments made over the year were adequate for each quarter based on annualized income and adjusted seasonal installment concepts described in this bill. Exempts from an estimated tax penalty any taxpayer whose tax liability is less than $500. Requires an addition to income tax when an adjustment of overpayment of estimated income tax by a corporation, made before the 15th day of the third month following the close of the taxable year, is found to be excessive.

Amends the IRC to allow employers to elect to have revised withholding certificates put into effect more promptly than is required under current law. Delays for one year, from 1987 until 1988, implementation of the increase from 80 percent to 90 percent in the current year liability test for estimated tax payments by individuals.

Part II: Estate Tax Provisions Relating to Employee Stock Ownership Plans - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to revise provisions relating to the estate tax deduction for proceeds received from a sale of employer securities to an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) or worker-owned cooperative. Makes such a deduction available only if: (1) the decedent directly owned the securities immediately before death; and (2) after the sale, the securities are either allocated to participants or held for future allocation in connection with certain exempt loans or transfers of assets. Prohibits, except in a bona fide business transaction, the treatment of employer securities as allocated or held for future allocation insofar as they are so categorized in substitution of other employer securities so designated. Applies the deduction to any sales of qualified employer securities (current law applies only to sales made by the executor of the estate). Prohibits the amount of the deduction from exceeding: (1) the amount that would lead to a reduction in estate tax liability (before credits) equal of $750,000; or (2) 50 percent of the taxable estate. Disallows proceeds from being taken into account when: (1) they exceed the net sale amount of dispositions of employer securities by the plan during the year preceding the sale in question; (2) they are attributable to transferred assets (except for assets held by the ESOP on February 26, 1987); (3) the sale takes place after the estate tax return filing deadline; or (4) the decedent received the securities under certain specified conditions. Applies the deduction to employer securities that are: (1) issued by a domestic corporation having no stock outstanding that is readily tradable on an established securities market; (2) includable in the gross estate of the decedent; and (3) would have been includable if the decedent had died within a specified time period.

Sets out the ordering rules to govern dispositions of employer securities for purposes of this excise tax and another specified excise tax relating to ESOPs. Makes the excise tax inapplicable to: (1) dispositions to employees, in certain cases; (2) exchanges associated with the liquidation of a corporation into a cooperative or with other reorganizational purposes; and (3) sales effected to meet IRC diversification requirements relating to pension trusts. Places liability for the excise tax on the employer maintaining the ESOP or the eligible worker-owned cooperative.

(The tax is currently due to expire as of 1988.)

Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue regulations to exempt specified types of sales from the tax. Extends until January 1, 2014 (currently January 1, 1996), the potential termination date for the temporary increase in the coal excise tax rate.

Protects from disclosure the names and addresses of contributors. Requires that tax-exempt charitable entities (501(c)(3) organizations) provide annual information with respect to transfers and other transactions involving certain other tax-exempt organizations as the Secretary of the Treasury might require to prevent misallocation of revenues or expenses or any diversion of funds from the organization's exempt purpose. Amends IRC penalty provisions relating to required filings by tax-exempt organizations and certain trusts to: (1) revise the maximum penalty applicable in certain cases; (2) fix a penalty for failure to include required and accurate information on a return; (3) fix a penalty for failure to comply with public inspection requirements; and (4) treat the penalties as tax for administrative purposes. Assesses penalties against tax-exempt organizations that willfully fail to comply with public inspection requirements. Imposes a penalty on any tax-exempt organization or political organization that offers to sell to an individual specific information or a routine service that could be readily obtained by that individual free of charge from a Federal agency. Part II: Political Activities - Extends the prohibition against certain political activities by tax-exempt organizations to include activities in opposition to any candidate (current law includes only those activities on behalf of a candidate). Provides that any 501(c)(3) organization whose status is terminated by reason of intervening in any political campaign either for or against a candidate for public office shall never be treated as a tax-exempt not-for-profit civic league or organization. Imposes on a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization: (1) a ten percent excise tax on its political expenditures; and (2) a 100 percent tax on any such expenditure that has been subject to the ten percent penalty tax and has not been corrected within the taxable period. Imposes on the manager of a 501(c)(3) organization: (1) a two and one-half percent tax, to a maximum amount of $5,000, if such manager knowingly agrees to a political expenditure by the organization; and (2) a 50 percent tax, to a maximum of $10,000, if the manager refuses to agree to part or all of a correction of the prohibited expenditure. Identifies the types of expenditures considered to be political. Provides for abatement or refund of any first tier (initial) excise tax on political expenditures if the affected organization establishes that the taxable event was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect and was corrected within the proper time. Authorizes a civil action in U.S. district court in the name of the United States to enjoin a 501(c)(3) organization from making additional political expenditures and for other relief appropriate to ensure that the organization's assets are preserved for charitable purposes. Permits such an action only if: (1) the Internal Revenue Service has notified the organization of its intent to seek the injunction and (2) the Commissioner of Revenue has personally determined that the organization has flagrantly participated in prohibited campaign activity, and that injunctive relief is appropriate to prevent future political expenditures. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, upon the finding that a 501(c)(3) organization has made political contributions in flagrant violation of the prohibition against such expenditures, to make an immediate termination assessment of any income tax payable by such organization, as well as any penalty taxes due with respect to political expenditures. Sets forth guidelines to govern such termination assessments. Imposes: (1) a five percent excise tax, to be paid by the organization, on the lobbying expenses of any organization whose 501(c)(3) status has been lost because of such expenditures; and (2) a corresponding penalty tax to be paid by the organization manager who agreed to such expenditures, knowing that they could result in the organization's loss of tax-exempt status."
