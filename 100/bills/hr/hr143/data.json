    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1987-01-06", 
    "text": "Emergency Educational Facilities Repair and Renovation for Jobs Act - Title I: Elementary and Secondary Educational Facilities - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1993 to the Department of Education to provide funds under this title to local educational agencies (LEAs) to employ unemployed individuals in maintenance, repair, renovation, and reconstruction of public school facilities. Requires States desiring to receive an allocation of such funds to submit a statement of assurances to the Secretary of Education concerning allocation of funds to LEAs and compliance with fiscal control and fund accounting procedures. Directs the Secretary to allocate one percent of such funds to specified U.S. territories and possessions and the remainder among the States and the District of Columbia on the basis of relative numbers of: (1) unemployed residents; (2) unemployed residents of areas of substantial unemployment (at least six and one-half percent for the most recent 12 months); (3) excess (number of unemployed individuals in excess of four and one-half percent of the civilian labor force either in the State or in areas of substantial unemployment) unemployed residents; and (4) low-income children. Prohibits the State educational agency (SEA) from reserving from the amount allocated to the State more than: (1) one percent for administrative costs; and (2) four percent for special needs. Directs the SEA, from the remainder, to allocate: (1) three-fourths among counties on the basis of relative numbers of unemployed residents and within each county according to the fund distribution formula under specified provisions of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 (ECIA); and (2) one-fourth among the LEAs on the basis of such ECIA formula. Requires that at least 70 percent of the funds made available to any LEA under this title be used for salaries and wages and associated benefits for individuals employed directly or indirectly by the LEA in such public school facilities repair, renovation, or reconstruction programs. Requires that, to the maximum extent feasible, funds under this title be used for projects and activities for which on-site labor can begin within 90 days of receipt of such funds. Requires that such funds be used in accordance with State and local procedures for: (1) assisting SEAs and LEAs to conform their public school facilities with specified requirements under the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and with post-construction requirements of government environmental protection or health and safety programs; (2) public school facilities repair, renovation, and reconstruction; (3) conversion of presently unused structures into adult training centers; (4) energy efficiency remodeling or renovation; and (5) asbestos detection, removal, or containment in facilities used by students. Authorizes the Secretary, on request, to issue rulings to any SEAs or LEAs on the proper construction and application of this title. Title II: Reconstruction at Postsecondary Institutions and Renovation of Academic Facilities - Directs the Secretary to carry out programs of financial assistance to institutions of higher education and to higher education building agencies for the reconstruction or renovation of academic facilities and libraries if the primary purpose of such assistance is to enable such institutions to: (1) economize on the use of energy resources, with a priority for the use of coal, solar, and renewable resources; (2) conform their academic facilities and libraries with specified requirements under the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and with post-construction requirements of government environmental protection or health and safety programs; (3) reconstruct and renovate research facilities; and (4) detect, remove, or contain asbestos hazards in facilities used by students. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1993 to the Department of Education to provide funds to States to employ unemployed individuals in maintenance, repair, renovation, and reconstruction of academic facilities at institutions of higher education. Sets forth annual State plan requirements for any State desiring to participate in the grant program under this title. Directs the Secretary to prescribe basic criteria for the consideration of State plans. Sets forth provisions for allocation of funds which are similar to those for title I of this Act (except that the factor of relative numbers of low-income children is replaced by relative numbers of students enrolled in institutions of higher education in each State). Sets forth provisions for use of funds and for the Secretary's authority which are similar to those for title I of this Act. Title III: Public Library Facilities - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1993 to the Department of Education to provide funds for the repair, renovation, remodeling, and alteration of facilities for public libraries. Directs the Secretary to allot from such funds to each State the minimum allotment specified under certain provisions of the Library Services and Construction Act. Provides for the allocation of the remainder of such funds among the States on a similar basis as those for allocation under titles I and II of this Act (but without the factors of relative numbers of low-income children or college students). Sets forth provisions for use of funds which are similar to those under titles I and II of this Act, but requires that only 60 percent (rather than 70 percent) of such funds be used for salaries and wages of the individuals employed in maintenance, repair, renovation, or reconstruction. Directs State library administrative agencies, to the maximum extent feasible, to consider relative unemployment in each county in determining projects to be funded under this title. Directs that the Secretary administer this title under existing regulations for title II (Public Library Construction) of the Library Services and Construction Act, but may, on request, issue rulings to any State on issues concerning the proper construction and application of this title. Title IV: General Provisions - Sets forth nondiscrimination provisions and other general requirements. Prohibits the employment, in a subsidized wage position under this Act, of individuals who have voluntarily terminated without good cause, within the preceding six months, full-time employment at or exceeding the Federal minimum wage. Requires that individuals in employment subsidized under this Act be paid at either the highest of the Federal minimum wage, the applicable State or local minimum wage, or the prevailing wage for employment in similar occupations by the same employer. Sets forth program labor standards relating to conditions of employment and training, health and safety standards, workers' compensation benefits, and job benefits and working conditions. Prohibits use of funds under this Act for contributions on behalf of any participant to retirement systems or plans. Prohibits displacement of any currently employed worker by participants in programs funded under this Act. Prohibits such programs from impairing existing contracts for services or collective bargaining agreements. Requires the written concurrence of the labor organization and the employer concerned before any such program which would be inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement may be undertaken. Prohibits program participants from being employed or job openings being filled when: (1) any other individual is on layoff from the same or any substantially equivalent job; or (2) the employer has terminated the employment of any regular employee or otherwise reduced its work force with the intention of filling the vacancy by hiring a participant whose wages are subsidized under this Act. Prohibits creation of jobs in a promotional line that will infringe in any way on the promotional opportunities of currently employed individuals. Requires recipients of funds under this Act to provide the Secretary with assurances that none of such funds will be used to assist, promote, or deter union organizing. Requires that an opportunity for comment be provided for any labor organization representing a substantial number of employees engaged in similar work or training in the same areas as that proposed to be funded under this Act. Applies the wage rate requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act to all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors in works federally assisted under this Act."
