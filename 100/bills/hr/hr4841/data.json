    "text": "International Narcotics Control Act of 1988 - Title I: Latin American Regional Anti-Narcotics Force - Expresses the sense of the Congress concerning the need for a Latin American regional anti-narcotics force. Instructs the President to direct the U.S. representative to the Organization of American States (OAS) to consult with other member nations on the feasibility of establishing a Latin American regional anti-narcotics force and developing a comprehensive regional strategy for dealing with narcotics production and trafficking. Directs the President to call for a meeting of heads of state of member nations, if there is a positive response within OAS, to conclude an agreement for: (1) the establishment of such a force, with appropriate member contributions of personnel, training, equipment, and financial resources; and (2) the development of such a strategy. Requires the President to direct the Secretary of Defense to provide appropriate assistance for the force. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the President to notify specified congressional committees not less than 15 days before obligating funds authorized under this title. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics Matters (Assistant Secretary) should: (1) seek the establishment of a regional anti-narcotics training center in the Caribbean; and (2) contribute funds or other resources and seek contributions from other countries to such a center. Urges the President to seek the establishment of other regional anti-narcotics forces.

Makes such amendments applicable with respect to any such certification made by the President on or after March 1, 1989. Provides that a country which in the previous year was designated as a major drug producing or a major drug-transit country may not be determined to be cooperating fully under such Act unless it has in place a bilateral agreement or a multilateral agreement to combat narcotics.
