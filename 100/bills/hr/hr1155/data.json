    "text": "Trade, Employment, and Productivity Act of 1987 - Title I: Investment in Human and Intellectual Capital Act of 1987 - Investment in Human and Intellectual Capital Act of 1987 - Subtitle A: Education Consolidation and Improvement Act Amendments of 1987 - Education Consolidation and Improvement Act Amendments of 1987 - Part I: Programs to Meet the Special Educational Needs of Disadvantaged Children - Amends Chapter 1 (Financial Assistance to Meet Special Educational Needs of Disadvantaged Children) of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 (ECIA) to authorize appropriations for FY 1988 through 1992 for: (1) basic grants and concentration grants for local educational agencies (LEAs); (2) State programs for migratory children; (3) State programs for neglected and delinquent children; (4) State administration of Chapter 1 programs; and (5) demonstration projects, evaluations, technical assistance, and other activities. Requires each State wishing to receive a Chapter 1 grant to submit, through its State educational agency (SEA), an application for up to three years for each Chapter 1 program for which it seeks assistance. Requires such application to describe criteria, policies, and procedures to: (1) assess the educational effectiveness of LEA Chapter 1 programs; (2) direct a LEA to take corrective measures if it is failing to provide effective Chapter 1 services; (3) permit LEAs that conduct highly successful Chapter 1 programs to implement schoolwide improvement programs in attendance areas in which at least 40 percent of the children are from low-income families; and (4) award incentive grants. Sets forth factors upon which assessments of educational effectiveness may be based. Requires each SEA, at least once every three years, to evaluate the educational effectiveness of services, including those for private school children, provided under Chapter 1 by each participating State agency and local educational agency. Requires such evaluations to be made available to the public. Amends title I (Financial Assistance to Meet Special Educational Needs of Children) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to revise provisions governing the allocation of funds for basic and concentration grants under Chapter 1 of ECIA. Directs the Secretary of Education to set aside not more than one percent of such funds for: (1) specified U.S. territories and possessions according to their respective needs; and (2) Department of the Interior Indian schools. Provides that Puerto Rico's share of such funds would be the same as its share for FY 1987. Directs the Secretary to use 95 percent of such funds for basic grants and five percent for concentration grants. Provides that allocation of basic grants to LEAs shall be on the basis of the number of poor children in excess of two percent of the total number of children in the school district. Revises requirements relating to the selection of school attendance areas for Chapter 1 programs. Requires LEAs to conduct Chapter 1 programs only in attendance areas that are among the poorest one-third of all areas in the district, in rank order of their poverty as measured by the number or percentage of poor children. Requires LEAs to provide services only to those children in greatest need of special assistance. Allows an LEA to serve attendance areas in rank order but beyond the poorest one-third if more than 25 percent of the children are from low-income families. Allows projects in attendance areas beyond the poorest one-third and without regard for the ordering requirement if the percentage of poor children in each attendance area in the district is within five percent of the district-wide percentage of poor children. Limits to one year the period during which previously eligible attendance areas and children may continue to be served under Chapter 1 programs. Revises Chapter 1 requirements relating to parental involvement in local programs. Requires each LEA to develop written policies to ensure that parents have adequate opportunity to participate in the design and implementation of its Chapter 1 project. Requires each LEA, at an annual meeting, to: (1) inform parents of their right to be consulted in such design and implementation; (2) request their comments and recommendations; and (3) inform parents of their right to establish procedures for discussing among themselves, with teachers, and with appropriate LEA officials the LEA's Chapter 1 program. Includes among resources and activities which may be provided to parents: (1) space and materials for meetings; (2) information on statutes and regulations applicable to Chapter 1 programs; and (3) training. Requires the SEA to approve LEA applications for basic and concentration grants that comply with Chapter 1 requirements. Directs the SEA to take corrective action when it finds that an LEA has substantially failed to carry out a Chapter 1 requirement. Provides that such corrective action may include withholding of funds or directing the LEA to issue compensatory education certificates. Provides for reallocation of withheld funds. Revises ECIA and ESEA provisions under which LEAs may conduct Chapter 1 projects on a schoolwide basis. Lowers from 75 percent to 60 percent the minimum percentage of poor children which a school must have in order to conduct schoolwide improvement. Eliminates a fiscal matching requirement for schoolwide improvement. Requires that local evaluations of Chapter 1 programs include an assessment of the impact that schoolwide projects have on the educational progress of educationally deprived children. Authorizes LEAs to provide compensatory education certificates to parents of educationally deprived children if such provision: (1) would be more effective in meeting the needs of eligible children than direct services provided by the LEA; or (2) is needed to provide services required under Chapter 1, including services to private school children. Allows each LEA to provide such certificates on the basis of individual grade levels, schools, attendance areas, or any combination thereof. Requires the LEA to apply the same criteria to public and private school children in determining the extent to which there is a need to provide such certificates. Sets the value of each certificate at an amount determined by the LEA to be equitable to all children selected to participate in the LEA's Chapter 1 program. Prohibits the amount of funds paid to parents from exceeding their actual cost of purchasing compensatory services. Requires use of certificate proceeds only to purchase supplementary compensatory education services that meet the identified special educational needs of the eligible child. Provides that such services may be purchased from any elementary or secondary school that the LEA determines is able to provide appropriate services. Authorizes the LEA also to specify other types of public and private organizations, such as institutions of higher education, from which parents may purchase such services. Permits each LEA to use Chapter 1 funds for the additional transportation costs of a child using such a certificate. Provides that certificate funds are not income for Federal income tax purposes. Requires LEAs to include information and assurances relating to certificates in their Chapter 1 applications.

Repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act. Amends the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization statute (RICO) provisions of the Federal criminal code to prohibit a civil action under RICO against any person who has not been convicted of a RICO violation, or of two acts of racketeering activity included in the pattern of racketeering activity, alleged in the complaint.

Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to provide that the ITC, when determining whether an increase in imports is a substantial cause or threat of serious injury to a domestic industry, should consider the condition of the industry over the course of the business cycle and shall not aggregate the causes of declining demand associated with a recession or economic downturn into a single cause of serious injury. Repeals provisions directing the ITC to recommend adjustment assistance as a remedy for such injury. Requires the ITC, in cases where it finds that specified import relief (for a period not to exceed five years) is necessary to prevent or remedy such injury, to determine whether a domestic industry (or segment thereof) would be competitive without further import relief. Sets forth specified economic factors the ITC shall consider in making such competitiveness assessment. Requires the ITC to recommend import relief of a scope and amount designed to assist a segment of an industry to become competitive if it finds that such industry can reasonably be expected to become competitive by the end of an appropriate period of import relief. Requires that the President receive from the ITC an affirmative finding under the competitiveness assessment test in order to provide appropriate import relief. Deletes provisions relating to presidential action on adjustment assistance petitions. Adds to the factors to be considered by the President when making a determination to provide import relief: (1) the likelihood that such relief would lead an industry or segment thereof to be competitive without further import relief upon the expiration of an appropriate period of such relief; and (2) any actions proposed by a trade association, firm, certified union, or group of workers to improve an industry's international competitive position. Deletes, with respect to the granting of such relief by the President, consideration of information relating to the extent to which workers in an industry have applied for adjustment assistance. Allows import relief to be reduced or terminated by the President upon the determination that the continuation of such relief: (1) in its present form can no longer reasonably be expected to lead to an industry (or segment thereof) that would be competitive after the expiration of an appropriate period of such relief; or (2) is no longer necessary to ensure a competitive industry. Requires the ITC, upon the request of the President or upon its own motion, to advise the President of its judgment as to the probable economic effect on the competitiveness of an industry (currently, on the industry) of the extension, reduction, or termination of such import relief. Adds to the possible actions the President shall undertake if he provides import relief: (1) the initiation of multilateral negotiations with foreign governments to address or otherwise alleviate the injury or threat of serious injury to such industry; and (2) the provision of Federal regulatory relief. Directs the President, if he decides to provide regulatory relief: (1) to order an expedited review of any Federal regulatory requirement; and (2) upon completion of such review, to take appropriate action within his authority or direct the head of an executive department or agency to take action to alter, ease, or eliminate such Federal requirement or, if such action is not within his authority or that of the executive department or agency, to request that the Congress enact legislation to amend, ease, or eliminate such Federal regulatory requirement. Exempts from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act information and documentary material filed pursuant to such regulatory relief provisions. Prohibits such information or material from being made public except as may be relevant to administrative or judicial proceedings. Permits disclosure of such information or material to the Congress. Requires the President, upon request from an industry producing a perishable agricultural product and upon a finding that there is a reasonable indication that such industry is vulnerable to serious and irreparable injury as a result of surges in imports of a like or directly competitive product, to request the ITC to investigate and monitor such imports for a period not to exceed two years. Permits a person who has filed a petition with the ITC alleging serious injury substantially caused by imports that are, on the date of filing, subject to investigation and monitoring by the ITC, to request that emergency action be taken with respect to such imports. Requires the ITC, if a request for emergency action has been made, to promptly make an investigation to determine whether: (1) an increase in such imports of a perishable agricultural product is a substantial cause or threat of serious injury to an industry producing a like or directly competitive product; (2) the serious injury is likely to be difficult to repair by reason of the perishability of the like or directly competitive agricultural product of an industry; and (3) the serious injury cannot otherwise be prevented by an ITC investigation under normal time periods. Requires the ITC, if it finds that such criteria have been met, to: (1) find that amount a duty or import restriction on such article which is necessary to prevent or remedy such injury; and (2) give preference to an increase in or imposition of a duty on such imports, if such relief is feasible and would prevent or remedy such injury. Directs the ITC to report its findings to the President not later than 21 days after such a petition is filed. Requires the President, upon receiving an affirmative finding from the ITC, to provide emergency import relief for such industry, unless within seven days it is determined that provision of such relief is not in the national economic interest of the United States. Requires the President, if it is determined appropriate to provide such relief and in order to prevent the serious and irreparable injury or threat thereof, to: (1) proclaim specified import relief; and/or (2) order the suspension of the liquidation of articles subject to such an affirmative finding that are entered or withdrawn from the warehouse after the date of such finding, and order the posting of a cash bond for the entry of such articles. Provides for the termination of such emergency relief. Requires petitions alleging serious injury from imports that are subject to ITC investigation and monitoring to indicate whether emergency action is requested. Prohibits such request from being made 90 days after the ITC initiates such investigation and monitoring. Prohibits, with specified exceptions, the payment of trade adjustment assistance or the acceptance of petitions for such assistance by the Secretary of Labor after September 30, 1987. Provides for the termination of the trade adjustment assistance program. Repeals specified provisions of the Trade Act of 1974 relating to petitions for such assistance. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to take such actions as may be necessary to administer or liquidate grants, contracts, agreements, loans, or other obligations made by the Secretary. Sets forth provisions relating to the repayment of such loans and other obligations arising in connection with the payment of adjustment assistance prior to the effective date of this Act. Authorizes appropriations for the termination of such assistance. Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require the determination of whether an act, policy, or practice by a foreign country is \"unreasonable\" to take into account reciprocal opportunities in the United States for foreign nationals and firms. Changes the deadline by which the United States Trade Representative (USTR) must make a recommendation to the President as to action that should be taken with respect to enforcement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, of specified trade agreements under the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, or unfair trade practices of foreign countries to the earlier of 30 days after the agreement's dispute settlement procedure is concluded or two years after the date the USTR investigation is initiated. Provides that such time limits may be waived by the petitioner requesting relief. Requires the USTR to submit semiannually a report to the Congress describing the commercial effects of actions to enforce such agreements or to respond to such unfair practices. Allows the President to take action on his own motion to enforce U.S. rights under trade agreements or respond to foreign trade practices. Requires the President to publish notice of his determination, including the reasons for it, in the Federal Register. Requires the President, unless he determines that expeditious action is required, to provide a public hearing (if requested) before taking action. Requires the USTR, upon written request, to make available to any person information concerning the nature of a specific trade policy or practice of a foreign government with respect to particular goods, services, investments, or intellectual property rights. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to change the method of dealing with dumping by nonmarket economy countries. Requires the administering authority, if it cannot determine the foreign market value of goods exported from a country with a State-controlled economy, to determine the foreign market value of such goods on the basis of the price at which comparable goods are sold at arm's length in the United States by the eligible market economy country with the lowest import price into the United States. Permits the administering authority, if the volume of imports from such eligible market economy country is insufficient to determine the foreign market value of such goods, to include additional eligible market economy countries in its determination of foreign market value. Permits the administering authority, if it determines that the prices of the eligible market economy country with the lowest import price do not accurately reflect fair value, if such prices cannot be adequately ascertained or adjusted, or if there is no eligible market economy country, to determine foreign market value of goods on the basis of either another eligible market economy country, or the constructed value of comparable goods in any country or countries other than a nonmarket economy country. Sets forth provisions relating to the administering authority's access to public information with respect to determining import prices. Defines \"eligible market economy country\" to mean a foreign country which is not a nonmarket economy country, in which comparable merchandise is produced for export to the United States, and which the administering authority determines is appropriate for use in calculating foreign market value, taking into account specified factors. Defines \"lowest import price\" to mean the lowest average price of comparable merchandise that is sold to the United States from an eligible market economy country over the applicable period of an import investigation. Defines \"comparable merchandise\" to mean merchandise contained in the same applicable numbers of the Tariff Schedules of the United States. Allows the administering authority to suspend an investigation in which foreign market value is determined upon acceptance of an agreement with a nonmarket economy country to restrict the volume of imports of merchandise which is the subject of an investigation. Provides that the countervailing duty laws shall not apply to merchandise from nonmarket economy countries. Provides that component products introduced into U.S. commerce that are covered by an antidumping finding or an antidumping or countervailing duty order and that are assembled in the United States shall be covered by such orders, provided that: (1) such components are imported from the country covered by such finding or order; (2) the value added in the United States is small in relation to the total value of the merchandise entered into the United States; and (3) such components were exported by a company related to the company performing the assembly in the United States. Provides similar provisions with respect to merchandise that is assembled in third world countries and merchandise that has been slightly altered in form or appearance. Revises the method for calculating foreign market value by adding that where taxes imposed in the country of exportation on exported merchandise are rebated or not collected, such value shall be decreased by the amount of such taxes imposed on such merchandise sold for home consumption. Requires the ITC, within 180 days after the administering authority notifies the ITC that a countervailing duty order applies to merchandise for which there was no injury determination and that international obligations of the United States, as determined by the USTR require such determination to be made, to make a determination of whether: (1) an industry would be materially injured or threatened with material injury; or (2) the establishment of an industry would be materially retarded, if the outstanding countervailing duty order on imports of duty-free merchandise were revoked. Suspends, pending receipt of the ITC's injury determination, the liquidation of entries covered by such order which are entered of withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after the date of the injury determination. Requires the outstanding countervailing duty order, including any cash deposits, to remain in effect. Requires the administering authority, pending receipt of the ITC's injury determination, to suspend any administrative review of such order which covers such merchandise on or after the effective date of the injury requirement. Requires the administering authority, upon an affirmative determination of injury by the ITC, to liquidate entries of merchandise that were suspended and to continue the suspension of liquidation and the collection of duties required to be deposited. Requires the countervailing duty order to remain in effect until revoked. Requires the administering authority, upon a negative determination of injury by the Commission, to revoke such order, publish notice of such revocation in the Federal Register, and refund, without interest, any countervailing duties collected during the period of suspension of liquidation. Requires the ITC, if the administering authority notifies the ITC that U.S. obligations require an injury determination and if a preliminary determination of whether a subsidy is being paid with respect to imported merchandise has not been made, to commence an investigation of injury as if it had been informed by the administering authority that a countervailing duty investigation was being instituted. Requires the ITC, if the administering authority has made a preliminary determination as to whether a subsidy is being paid, to commence an investigation of injury as if such preliminary determination was made on the effective date of the injury requirement. Requires the ITC to make: (1) its preliminary determination of injury not later than 45 days after it receives notification from the administering authority that U.S. obligations require such determination; and (2) its final determination not later than 120 days after such notification. Declares that the lawfulness of acts of importation into, or sale in, the United States of articles that infringe a valid U.S. patent, copyright, trademark, mask work, or trade secret shall be determined without regard to whether such acts have the effect of destroying, substantially injuring, or preventing the establishment of a U.S. industry. Permits any person to petition the ITC for the issuance of an order to exclude such articles, during its investigation, from entry into the United States. Sets forth: (1) increased civil penalties for unfair practices in foreign trade; and (2) procedures for the modification or rescission of an ITC order with respect to such a practice.
