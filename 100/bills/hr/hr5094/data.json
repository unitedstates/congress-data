Rept. 100-822 (Part III)) Depository Institutions Act of 1988 - Makes technical amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. Title I: Securities Activities of National Banks and Bank Holding Company Subsidiaries - Amends the Banking Act of 1933 to permit banks which are members of the Federal Reserve System (member banks) to be affiliates of qualified securities subsidiaries. Sets forth transitional rules for nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies engaging in securities activities. Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to allow bank holding companies to own shares of qualified securities subsidiaries.

Requires bank holding companies to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board prior to the formation or acquisition of a qualified securities subsidiary by a bank holding company. Prohibits such approval if the Federal Reserve Board determines that the establishment of such a subsidiary would cause: (1) an adverse effect on holding company resources to the detriment of depository institution subsidiaries; or (2) undue concentration in the banking and securities industries. Requires the disapproval of the Federal Reserve Board if an applicant submits an incomplete application, or if the Board determines that certain community benefit, public benefit, or minimum risk-based capital requirements have not been met. Requires any bank holding company that establishes a qualified securities subsidiary to transfer out of its depository institution subsidiaries any securities related activity. Allows certain exceptions to such transfer requirement. Allows up to a one-year transition period for the transfer of such activities if the Federal Reserve Board determines that such a transfer would cause undue hardship or excessive disruption to the operations of the bank holding company. Prohibits any nonbank subsidiary of a bank holding company (other than a qualified securities subsidiary) from engaging in any securities activity after the earlier of: (1) the date a qualified securities subsidiary of such bank holding company commences operations; or (2) two years after the enactment of this Act.

Authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to require the divestment of a qualified securities subsidiary by a bank holding company if certain risked-based capital requirements are not met. Specifies that no provision of this Act shall be construed as: (1) superseding any provision of any Federal securities law or regulation relating to the registration or regulation of brokers, dealers, underwriters, or members of exchanges by the Securities and Exchange Commission; or (2) limiting the authority of the Federal Reserve Board to prescribe regulations, issue orders, require reports and make examinations with respect to qualified securities subsidiaries or to regulate bank holding companies and bank holding company subsidiaries. Sets forth additional definitions relating to securities activities for purposes of this Act. Restates and reorganizes certain provisions of Federal banking laws relating to the general powers of national banks and the powers of national banks to engage in securities activities and commercial paper activities. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to limit the securities affiliations of insured nonmember banks to those in which a national bank may engage. Specifies that a State may not prohibit a bank or a bank holding company from being affiliated with a qualified securities subsidiary solely because the securities subsidiary is engaged in activities permitted by this Act. Allows certain exceptions to Federal Reserve Board approval requirements in connection with certain bank reorganizations. Sets forth expedited procedures for certain reorganizations of banks into bank holding companies and for bank holding companies to seek approval to engage in certain nonbanking activities.

Allows a bank or insured institution subsidiary of a bank holding company to sell loan assets to securities subsidiaries under specific, limited circumstances.

Provides notice, administrative hearing and adjudicatory procedures for requiring such a divestiture. Requires the Federal Reserve Board to submit a report to the Congress containing proposed regulations required to implement the provisions of this Act.

Imposes criminal penalties upon any person who participates in the affairs of any federally regulated depository institution or holding company or subsidiary after having been suspended, removed from office, or prohibited from participating in the affairs of any depository institution by an order of the appropriate Federal banking regulatory agency. (Current law imposes criminal penalties only for participating in the affairs of the institution from which the person was prohibited, removed, or suspended.) Revises procedures for the termination of FDIC deposit insurance to delete provisions requiring 120 days' advance notice by the FDIC to the appropriate Federal and State banking regulatory agencies prior to such a termination. Increases from $100 per day to $2,500 per day the penalty for unauthorized participation in the affairs of a depository institution by any person who has been convicted of any criminal offense involving dishonesty or a breach of trust. Makes both the depository institution and the individual involved subject to such penalty. (Current law makes only the depository institution subject to such penalty.) Authorizes the FHLBB and the FSLIC to issue civil enforcement orders concerning a service corporation of an association or a subsidiary of such service corporation, whether wholly or partly owned.

Title VII: Federal Asset Disposition Association - Federal Asset Disposition Association Dissolution Act - Amends the National Housing Act to specify that the purpose for establishing new savings and loan associations in connection with liquidations is for such an association to operate as an issuer of savings accounts and a lender and investor and not as an institution having the special purpose of managing or disposing of assets acquired from insured institutions in default. Specifies that provisions of the National Housing Act shall not be construed as authorizing the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) to organize a new Federal association for the purpose of managing or disposing of any assets: (1) of an insured institution for which the FSLIC has been appointed receiver; or (2) acquired by the FSLIC in order to prevent a default. Authorizes the FSLIC to delegate such liquidation functions to an appropriate regional office. Prohibits the Federal Asset Disposition Association (FADA) from engaging in any new activities after the date of the enactment of this Act.

Requires the FSLIC to liquidate the assets of insolvent savings and loan associations in a manner which: (1) minimizes the cost to the FSLIC; (2) maximizes the return which the FSLIC realizes on the assets; and (3) encourages the use of services of persons in the private sector in managing and disposing of such assets to the maximum extent possible. Requires the FSLIC to ensure that no individuals are employed by the FSLIC under personal service contracts except to the extent that such employment: (1) does not exceed 60 days in any one-year period; or (2) is determined to be necessary because of unusual circumstances which do not allow the position involved to be filled by a civil service employee. Provides that the number of asset liquidation personnel employed by the FSLIC shall not be subject to any limitation imposed by any officer of the executive branch who is not an officer of the FSLIC. Imposes a statutory limit on the number of asset liquidation employees that may be employed at any time by the FSLIC.
