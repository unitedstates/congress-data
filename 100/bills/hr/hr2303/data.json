Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to consider any entity that is conducting a farming operation independently of all of its members to be a separate person. Requires the Secretary to attribute all payments received by an entity to the members of the entity that have an interest in it, such attribution to be based upon the member's interest. Declares that an individual or entity shall be considered to be actively engaged in farming if such individual or entity has made a significant contribution to the farming operation of: (1) land, cash, or equipment; and (2) labor management. Permits the Secretary not to attribute payments to a member of an entity if: (1) such member's interest in the entity is less than ten percent; and (2) attribution of the payments to such member would have little or no impact on the implementation of the limitation on deficiency payments. Title III: Trade - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to revise the allocation of funds for export promotion programs for FY 1987, 1988, 1989, and 1990.

States that such receipts shall cease to be liabilities of the Corporation. Declares that the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall encourage the sale of Federal Crop Insurance through licensed private insurance agents and brokers. Requires the Board to provide such agents and brokers after September 30, 1991, with indemnification for errors or omissions on the part of the Corporation or its contractors for which the agent or broker is sued or held liable, except to the extent the agent or broker has caused the error or omission. Places a personnel cap on Corporation employees after September 30, 1991, of 50 permanent, full-time employees. Provides for payment by the Corporation of producer premiums in decreasing percentages from 32 percent for FY 1988 to six percent for FY 1991. Leaves the Corporation with authority to provide reinsurance, which, after September 30, 1991, shall be premium sustained.

Title VI: Recovery of Costs for Services - Subtitle A: Grain Inspection Fees - Amends the United States Grain Standards Act to require each designated official agency and each delegated State agency to pay fees to the Administrator of the Federal Grain Inspection Service to cover the costs of supervising official agency personnel.

Subtitle B: Service Payments Under Federal Milk Marketing Orders; Repeal of Timetable for Implementation of Marketwide Service - Amends the Food Security Improvements Act of 1986 with respect to payments under Federal milk marketing orders to repeal the timetable for implementation of marketwide service. Subtitle C: To Recover the Costs of Various Other Programs; Recover Cost of Carrying Out Wholesale Market - Amends the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to prescribe and collect fees from those who obtain services or assistance under the market development program. Provides for administrative and civil penalties for failure to pay such fees. Directs the Secretary to prescribe and collect fees to cover the costs of carrying out: (1) inspection and certification programs for apples and pears; (2) distribution and marketing programs under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946; and (3) activities relating to standards and specifications for agricultural products under the same Act. Provides for administrative and civil penalties for failure to pay such fees. Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 (as reenacted and amended by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937), the Plant Variety Protection Act, and the Cotton Statistics and Estimates Act, respectively, to direct the Secretary to assess fees for: (1) carrying out Federal marketing agreements and orders; (2) plant variety protection certificates; and (3) cotton classing services.
