Applies such guarantee to: (1) certain frozen stock; (2) stock outstanding on the date of enactment of this Act; and (3) certain stock required to be purchased in order to obtain an FCS institution (institution) loan. Requires an FCS lender to restructure a financially-stressed loan if the loan's restructured value would exceed its liquidated value.
