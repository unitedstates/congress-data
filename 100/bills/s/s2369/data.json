(Currently, such preference is limited to levels above the GS-1 level.) Reduces from 90 days to 30 days the time that must elapse after the Secretary submits a manpower estimate to the defense committees before the Secretary may approve the full-scale engineering development of a major defense acquisition program. Waives such required period during time of war or national emergency declared by the Congress or the President. Reduces such period to ten days if such estimate submitted to the Secretary with respect to such program indicates that no increase in military or civilian end strength will be required. Title VI: Compensation and Other Personnel Benefits - Part A: Pay and Allowances - Waives the automatic adjustment to military pay for FY 1989 in conformity with the GS-level adjustment applicable to Federal employees, instead authorizing an increase of 4.3 percent in the rate of basic pay, basic allowance for quarters, and basic allowance for subsistence.

Specifies the rates at which such higher-grade officers are to receive such additional special pay, such rate increasing as the length of service increases. Limits the total compensation to be paid to such officers to the total compensation paid to comparable physicians in private practice, as determined by the Secretary.

Authorizes the payment of special pay, at an annual rate not to exceed $10,000, for officers of the Selected Reserve who are qualified in a specialty designated by regulations as a critically short wartime specialty and who execute a written agreement to serve in the Selected Reserve for no less than one year nor more than three years beginning on the date the officer accepts such special pay. Requires an appropriate refund when such officer fails to complete such additional duty. Terminates the authority to enter into such agreements as of September 30, 1990. Provides that such pay authority shall be used only for the purpose of conducting a pilot test program to determine its effect on the retention of officers who are qualified in critically short wartime specialties. Limits the total amount to be obligated for such pay authority for FY 1989. Directs the Secretary, no later than September 1, 1988, to report to the defense committees a description of the manner in which such pilot test program is to be structured.

Authorizes the Secretary of the military department concerned to pay a specified monthly annuity to any unremarried surviving spouse of a member of the armed forces who: (1) died before November 1, 1953; and (2) was entitled to retired or retainer pay on his or her date of death. Requires such annuity to be reduced by other survivors' benefits to which such surviving spouse is entitled. Directs such annuity to be increased whenever military retired or retainer pay is increased. Entitles military personnel assigned on temporary duty overseas to travel and transportation allowances incident to personal emergencies. Adds to the definition of a military \"dependent\" for travel purposes of military personnel any child for whom care and support is provided by the member pursuant to an order of custody issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. Revises provisions relating to a civilian clothing allowance for members of the armed forces to allow such allowance only for officers who are required to wear such clothing as part of their regular duties. Permits (rather than requires) such clothing allowance to be paid. Changes from mandatory to discretionary the payment of a travel and transportation allowance incident to the voluntary extension of an overseas tour of duty.
