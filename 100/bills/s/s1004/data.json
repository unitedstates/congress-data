    "text": "Education Competitiveness and Improvement Act of 1987 - Title I: Reauthorization and Improvement of Chapter 1 Programs - Amends the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 (ECIA) to extend through FY 1993 the authorization of appropriations for programs under ECIA Chapter 1 (Financial Assistance to Meet Special Educational Needs of Disadvantaged Children). Requires each State educational agency (SEA) to reserve up to five percent of Chapter 1 basic grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) in the State to be used for incentive grants. Provides that such incentive grants shall be made to LEAs which have the most successful Chapter 1 programs according to State-determined criteria which may include: (1) scores of participating students on basic reading, mathematics, or other subject standardized achievement tests; (2) improvement in school attendance or secondary school completion rates; or (3) adherence to State-established effective schools standards. Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to increase the maximum level of grants for State administration of ECIA Chapter 1 programs. Allows Chapter 1 programs to be conducted in no more than one-third of an LEA's school attendance areas, selected in rank order on the basis of the highest number or percentage of resident children from low-income families. Allows an LEA to conduct chapter 1 programs in any of its attendance areas if the percentage of children from low-income families in each attendance area is within five percent of the LEA average. Revises ESEA provisions relating to the ECIA Chapter 1 program to provide for a small State minimum whereby the aggregate amount which LEAs in a State are eligible to receive under chapter 1 must at least equal one-half of one percent of the total amounts available under Chapter 1. Authorizes LEAs (with SEA approval) to use up to two percent of their Chapter 1 grants to pay up to 50 percent of the costs of innovative projects. Includes among such innovative projects: (1) continuation of services to children eligible for services in any preceding year; (2) extended services to eligible children transferred to ineligible areas or schools as part of a desegregation plan; (3) incentive payments to schools that have demonstrated significant progress and success in attaining Chapter 1 goals; (4) training of teachers not paid with Chapter 1 funds with respect to the special educational needs of eligible children and the integration of Chapter 1 activities into regular classroom programs; (5) programs to encourage innovative approaches to parental involvement; and (6) programs to encourage community and private sector involvement and resources in meeting the needs of eligible children. Establishes additional requirements for parental involvement in Chapter 1 programs. Requires LEAs to implement procedures of sufficient size, scope, and quality to give reasonable promise of substantial progress in achieving the goals of informing parents about the Chapter 1 program, training parents to help instruct their children, and consulting with parents on school-parent cooperation activities. Requires LEAs to: (1) have written policies on parental involvement in Chapter 1; (2) provide support for parent involvement activities; and (3) hold parent-teacher conferences at least annually. Authorizes LEA to implement a number of other specified types of parental involvement activities. Requires parental involvement activities to be coordinated to the extent possible with programs assisted under the Adult Education Act. Revises Chapter 1 provisions regarding participation by private school pupils to authorize grants to help LEAs meet capital expenses associated with serving such pupils. Limits such capital expenses to expenditures for noninstructional goods and services such as the purchase, lease, and renovation of real and personal property (including but not limited to mobile educational units and computer equipment and materials), insurance and maintenance costs, transportation, and other comparable goods and services. Makes such grants to States in proportion to the number of private school pupils served under Chapter 1 during the 1984-1985 school year. Authorizes appropriations for such grants for FY 1988 through 1993. Amends Chapter 1 and the Head Start Act to require LEAs and Head Start agencies to develop and carry out plans to follow the success and needs of students who participated in the Head Start program in the community. Title II: Reauthorization and Revision of the Consolidated Programs Under Chapter 2 - Renames the heading of ECIA Chapter 2 \"Federal Programs for the Improvement of Elementary and Secondary Education.\" Revises the purpose of the Chapter 2 program to be the support of innovative or expanded activities in the areas of basic skills instruction, educational improvement and support services, plus special projects. Requires that Chapter 2 funds be used in accordance with the needs and priorities determined by SEAs and LEAs. Prohibits the use of Chapter 2 funds for any activity for more than three continuous years, beginning in FY 1991. Permits waivers of such prohibition in cases of unusual hardship or upon demonstration that the supported activity has been changed over the prior three-year period. Extends the authorization of appropriations for Chapter 2 programs through FY 1993. Revises the use of funds for basic skills instruction.

Permits the SEA to reserve up to ten percent of State grants for administration, technical assistance, coordination, and statewide planning. Directs the SEA to distribute at least 90 percent of such grants on a competitive basis to LEAs. Requires that at least 50 percent of such funds be used for programs that include the identification and education of disadvantaged gifted and talented children from low-income families. Requires that services be made available on an equitable basis to pupils attending nonprofit private schools in LEAs receiving such grants. Authorizes the Secretary to make discretionary grants for personnel training, research, evaluation, or related activities for the education of gifted and talented children. Provides for equitable participation by nonprofit private school pupils and teachers. Sets forth provisions for State allotments under this part.

Sets forth application requirements. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1992.
