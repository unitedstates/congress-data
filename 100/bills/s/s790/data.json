    "as": "Passed Senate amended", 
    "date": "1987-03-27", 
    "text": "(Measure passed Senate, amended, roll call #44 (79-11)) Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 - Title I: Financial Institutions Competitive Equality - Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to revise the definition of \"bank\" to include any bank whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and any institution that: (1) accepts demand deposits or deposits that the depositor may withdraw by check or similar means for payment to third parties; and (2) engages in the business of making commercial loans. Excludes from the definition: (1) a foreign bank solely by virtue of its having an insured or uninsured branch in the United States; (2) an insured thrift institution; (3) an organization that does not do business in the United States except as incident to its activities outside the United States; (4) certain institutions that function solely in a trust or fiduciary capacity; (5) a credit union; (6) any institution which engages only in credit card operations; (7) an Edge Act or Agreement corporation; and (8) an industrial loan company. Provides that credit card banks, trust companies, Edge Act and Agreement corporations and industrial loan companies shall be subject to: (1) the Federal Reserve Act's limitations on loans by a member bank to officers, directors, and principal shareholders of the bank or its parent; and (2) the anti-tying provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970. Grandfathers companies that controlled such entities that become \"banks\" under the definition of this Act (nonbank banks) as of March 5, 1987, in order that such companies shall not be limited by provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act, provided that the parent company does not: (1) obtain control of an additional bank or thrift institution; or (2) acquire more than five percent of the shares or assets of such a bank or thrift institution. Permits such acquisitions under specified circumstances. Specifies that until the Congress has enacted proposals concerning all banks and bank holding companies, a bank may not: (1) engage in any activity in which it was not lawfully engaged as of March 5, 1987; (2) engage in any joint marketing with an affiliate in which it was not engaged as of March 5, 1987; (3) permit any overdraft on behalf of an affiliate, or overdraw its own account at a Federal Reserve Bank on behalf of an affiliate; or (4) increase its assets at an annual rate of more than seven percent. Prohibits an institution which becomes a bank under the revised definition of this Act and is controlled by a bank holding company from: (1) engaging in activities that would have made it a bank under prior definitions of \"bank\"; or (2) increasing the number of locations from which it conducts business after March 5, 1987. Allows State-chartered FDIC-insured savings banks that are owned by a bank holding company to engage in nonbanking activity which is authorized by State law. Requires that such activity be terminated within two years if the savings bank is acquired by a company which does not qualify as a savings bank holding company. Defines a \"savings bank holding company\" as any company which owns or controls one or more State-chartered savings banks if the assets of the subsidiary (which were chartered by a State on or before October 15, 1982) constitute at least 70 percent of the total assets of the holding company. Revises the definition of \"thrift institution\" to include any State-chartered savings bank whose holding company is registered as a savings and loan holding company under the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act. Exempts from the Bank Holding Company Act any company which owns or controls any State-chartered bank or trust company which is wholly owned by thrift institutions or savings banks and which restricts itself to performing certain limited services for thrift institutions. Amends the Federal Reserve Act to limit the type of transactions a member bank and its subsidiaries may engage in with an affiliate to those which are under substantially the same terms and conditions as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. Makes such limitation applicable to FDIC-insured nonmember banks. Provides that any company, other than a bank, which directly or indirectly acquires an Edge Act or Agreement corporation after March 5, 1987, should be considered a bank holding company for all purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act except for those provisions relating to the acquisition of additional banks. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to apply to FDIC-insured nonmember banks for one year the restrictions relating to affiliations between member banks and organizations engaged principally in certain securities activities and to employee relationships involving a member bank and a person or organization primarily engaged in certain securities activities. Amends the National Housing Act to revise the definition of \"bank\" and \"bank holding company\" to have the same meaning as in the Bank Holding Company Act. Provides that no savings and loan holding company which is not an insured institution may commence, or continue for more than two years after the date it becomes a holding company, any activity other than those presently permissible for a multiple savings and loan holding company with certain exceptions. Exempts from such restrictions unitary savings and loan holding companies whose subsidiary thrifts meet a qualified thrift lender test (thrifts which devote at least 60 percent of their assets to housing and related activities). Grandfathers unitary savings and loan holding companies formed before March 5, 1987, provided certain conditions are met. Provides that prohibitions on inter-affiliate transactions currently applicable to savings and loan holding companies shall not apply to transactions between a subsidiary thrift institution and affiliates engaged in activities permissible for a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act. Provides that such transactions shall be subject to the restrictions of the Federal Reserve Act. Prohibits diversified savings and loan holding companies and their subsidiary thrift institutions from engaging in joint marketing activities. Provides that a State-chartered insured institution that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company shall be subject to the anti-tying restrictions of the Home Owner's Loan Act of 1933 to the same extent and in the same manner as a Federal association. Establishes a procedure under which companies that own only State-chartered savings banks, which are normally treated as \"banks\" under the Bank Holding Company Act, may be regulated as savings and loan holding companies rather than as bank holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act. Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to provide that no member institution of a Federal Home Loan Bank shall be eligible for advances from that bank unless the member meets the qualified thrift lender test. Amends the National Housing Act to provide that provisions of the Banking Act of 1933 relating to affiliations between member banks and organizations engaged principally in certain securities activities and relating to certain officer, director, or employee relationships involving a member bank and a person or organization primarily engaged in certain securities activities shall be applicable to every insured institution in the same manner and to the extent as if such insured institution were a member bank. Allows a thrift institution operating in mutual form to reorganize into a holding company by: (1) forming an interim stock savings bank to be wholly owned by the mutual institution; and (2) transferring its assets and liabilities to the interim bank. Specifies that the institution seeking to reorganize in such manner must provide the Federal Home Loan Bank Board 60 days' prior written notice. Deems such an application to be approved unless the Bank Board disapproves it within the 60-day period. Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to allow an FDIC-insured savings bank operating in mutual form to reorganize so as to form a holding company under the same procedures. Provides that a corporation organized as such a holding company shall be regulated on the same terms and be subject to the same limitations as a stock savings bank holding company (as specified under this Act). Authorizes national banks to invest in property for lease financing transactions on a net lease basis, provided that such investment may not exceed ten percent of the assets of the association. States that nonprofit organizations operated for political purposes are eligible to own negotiable order of withdrawal accounts. Amends the National Housing Act to exempt thrift institutions (which are not controlled by another company) which become savings and loan holding companies from certain restrictions imposed by the savings and loan holding company statutes regarding affiliate transactions, declaration of dividends, and indebtedness. Lists certain factors which must be considered by the Corporation prior to the approval of an acquisition or change in control of insured institutions. Directs the President to appoint a National Commission on Competitiveness in the Financial Services Industry. Requires the Commission to submit a report to the President and the Congress containing recommended changes to the product and service authorities and regulation of financial companies. Title II: Moratorium on Certain Nonbanking Activities - Imposes a moratorium, beginning March 6, 1987, and continuing through March 1, 1988, on: (1) the expansion of foreign bank activities; (2) certain stock acquisitions by foreign corporations; (3) the approval of the acquisition by any bank holding company or by an insured bank of any entity engaged in the flotation, underwriting, public sale, or distribution of securities; (4) the issuance of any rule, regulation, or order that would have the effect of increasing the insurance powers of banks, bank holding companies, or their subsidiaries; (5) the approval of the acquisition by a bank holding company of any company, including a State-chartered bank, unless the bank holding company has agreed to limit the insurance activities of that company; (6) expansion by a national bank of its insurance activities into places where it was not conducting such activities as of March 5, 1987; and (7) the issuance of any rule, regulation, or order that would have the effect of increasing real estate powers of banks or bank holding companies or their banking or nonbanking subsidiaries. Title III: Recapitalization of FSLIC - Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation Recapitalization Act of 1987 - Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to direct the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (Board) to charter a corporation to be known as the Financing Corporation. Sets forth provisions concerning the membership, administration, and powers of such corporation. Requires each Federal Home Loan Bank to invest in the nonvoting capital stock of the Financing Corporation at such times and in such amounts as the Board may prescribe. Limits the aggregate amount of funds invested by all Federal Home Loan Banks in such capital stock. Limits the amount of funds which such Federal Home Loan Bank shall invest based on the reserves and profits of each Bank. Requires a pro rata distribution among all Federal Home Loan Banks of the amount such Banks are required to invest in the Financing Corporation. Limits the amount of obligations of the Financing Corporation which may be outstanding at any time. Requires that the net proceeds of any obligations issued by the Financing Corporation shall be invested in the capital certificates or capital stock issued by the Federal Savings and Loan Corporation (FSLIC). Grants tax exempt status to any obligations issued by the Financing Corporation. Authorizes the Financing Corporation to assess, with the approval of the Board, on each insured institution an assessment for each semiannual period equal to one-half of an amount not to exceed one-twelfth of one percent of the aggregate amount of all accounts of insured members of such insured institution for the year in which such semiannual period occurs. Authorizes supplemental assessments with the approval of the Board. Specifies that the total amount of assessments may not exceed interest and financing costs. Limits the use and disposition of assets of the Financing Corporation not invested in the FSLIC. Requires the Financing Corporation to invest in and hold in a segregated account a specified amount of zero coupon instruments to assure the repayment of principal on obligations of the Financing Corporation. Establishes a Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation Industry Advisory Committee. Sets forth provisions concerning the membership, administration, and powers of such Advisory Committee. Requires the Advisory Council to: (1) review quarterly reports and budgets of the FSLIC; and (2) report annually to specified committees of the Congress concerning any reports and recommendations made by the Committee to the Board and the FSLIC during the year. Exempts such Committee from the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Terminates the Financing Corporation and the Advisory Committee as soon as practicable after the earlier of: (1) the date by which all stock purchased by the Financing Corporation in the FSLIC has been retired; or (2) December 31, 2026. Provides that the Financing Corporation shall be deemed to be a \"mixed ownership\" Government corporation for purposes of the Government Corporations Control Act. Amends the National Housing Act to authorize the issuance and sale of capital certificates and stock by the FSLIC to the Financing Corporation. Provides that the Financing Corporation shall be the sole purchaser of both capital certificates and the capital stock issued by the FSLIC and that the proceeds from such purchase shall be included as part of the primary reserve of the FSLIC. Prohibits the FSLIC from paying any dividends to the Financing Corporation on the capital certificates and stock. Requires the FSLIC to establish an equity return account to be funded by contributions by the FSLIC according to a specified formula based on FSLIC reserves. Requires the Financing Corporation: (1) to transfer earnings on any investment of amounts in such equity account to its primary reserve account; and (2) upon maturity of its obligations, to pay off and retire any capital stock using only amounts accumulated in such equity return account. Reduces the amount of premiums that may be imposed on insured institutions by the FSLIC by an amount equal to assessments imposed by the Financing Corporation. Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to allow the Board to authorize a Federal Home Loan Bank to declare and pay dividends out of its undivided profits or legal reserves if: (1) the Bank incurs a loss in connection with Financing Corporation stock and has reduced all other reserves to zero; and (2) there is an extraordinary need for member institutions of the bank to receive dividends. Limits the amounts of special premiums the FSLIC may assess in 1987 through 1991 unless severe pressures exist. Provides that any security interest granted to a Federal Home Loan Bank by any member of any Federal Home Loan Bank or any affiliate of any such member shall be entitled to priority over the claims of any party other than parties which have obtained a perfected security interest. Revises FSLIC report requirements to require the FSLIC to prepare quarterly reports and budgets and to submit semiannual reports and budgets to specified committees of the Congress. Requires the FSLIC to prescribe uniform accounting standards consistent with generally accepted accounting principles to be used by all insured institutions for the purpose of determining compliance with any rule or regulation issued by the FSLIC or the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to the same degree such standards are used to determine compliance with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Specifies that such standards shall become effective on December 31, 1987, with respect to each insured institution, except an insured institution that files a plan acceptable to the Corporation for achieving compliance at the earliest feasible date but in no event later than December 31, 1993. Authorizes the General Accounting Office to audit the Federal Asset Disposition Association. Requires the Board to: (1) prepare and transmit to the Congress guidelines for dealing with troubled thrift institutions in a manner which will maximize the long term viability of the thrift industry at the lowest cost to the FSLIC; and (2) transmit to the Congress, by January 31, 1989, an evaluation of the effectiveness of such guidelines. Specifies the types of programs to be addressed in such guidelines. Prohibits the FSLIC or the Board from directing or requiring an insured institution or an association to establish reserves against, or write down the value of, any asset in an amount in excess of the amount that would result from an evaluation of the asset consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, as established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Requires the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to transmit a report to the Congress containing a detailed description of steps that the Board has taken and will take administratively, and of any legislation necessary, to prevent additional insolvencies of thrift institutions. Ensures that minority owned or controlled commercial banks, investment banking firms, underwriters, and bond counsels shall have an opportunity to participate in all public offerings to recapitalize the FSLIC. Title IV: Emergency Acquisitions - Financial Institutions Emergency Acquisitions Amendments of 1987 - Amends the Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 to reinstate provisions of the Deposit Insurance Flexibility Act which expired October 13, 1986, and extends such provisions until March 1, 1990. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to revise provisions governing interstate acquisitions of troubled banks involving Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) financial assistance. Authorizes an out-of-State bank or holding company to: (1) acquire a bank with total assets of $500,000,000 or more that is in danger of closing as certified by the appropriate Federal or State chartered authority; (2) acquire a holding company that controls insured bank subsidiaries which hold assets equal to at least $500,000,000, represent a third or more of the total assets of all bank subsidaries of such holding company, and are in danger of closing; (3) acquire such subsidiaries and affiliated banks; or (4) establish newly chartered banks in the State where such subsidiaries are chartered to merge with or purchase the assets and assume the liabilities of such subsidiaries and affiliated banks. Permits the FDIC to assist a merger or acquisition of an insured bank only at the request of the bank's directors or trustees. Provides that a bank which receives FDIC troubled bank assistance when it is eligible to be acquired by an out-of-State bank or holding company shall remain eligible for such acquisition so long as such assistance remains outstanding, with FDIC approval. Permits an out-of-State bank to make such an extraordinary acquisition under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act only if such ownership is otherwise specifically authorized.
