    "date": "1987-10-27", 
    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 2470 passed in lieu) Medicare Catastrophic Loss Prevention Act of 1987 - Amends part A (Hospital Insurance) of title XVIII (Medicare of the Social Security Act to remove durational limitations on Medicare coverage of inpatient hospital services, and cover 150 days of post-hospital extended care services per year, for an individual covered under parts A and B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of the Medicare program. (Individuals covered only under part A would be subject to current durational limitations on such services.) Provides that an individual covered under parts A and B of the Medicare program shall not be required to pay more than one deductible for inpatient hospital services and one deductible for blood furnished in connection with such services per year. (Currently such deductibles are imposed for each \"spell of illness.\") Eliminates the coinsurance requirement imposed on such individuals for extended hospital stays. Imposes a coinsurance rate, equal to 15 percent of the average per diem cost of post-hospital extended care services, for the first ten days of a part A and B beneficiary's receipt of such services per year. (Currently, the coinsurance requirement applies to days 21 through 100 of a \"spell of illness\" requiring such services.) Amends part B of the Medicare program to cover all of the out-of-pocket Medicare expenses which a part B beneficiary incurs in excess of $1,850 in 1988, and $2,030 in 1989, adjusted annually thereafter to reflect changes in the cost-of-living. Provides for the adjustment of Medicare payments to organizations providing health care on a prepaid basis so as to reimburse them for such excess out-of-pocket costs incurred on behalf of enrollees. Includes as out-of-pocket costs: (1) beneficiary cost sharing expenses; and (2) amounts expended for specified preventive health services. Imposes a monthly catastrophic coverage premium of $4.00 for 1988 on an individual covered under parts A and B of the Medicare program, with annual adjustments to such premium thereafter reflecting changes in the amount of catastrophic benefits paid and the need to establish and maintain a contingency or reserve Fund. Imposes a smaller monthly catastrophic coverage premium on individuals who are only covered under part B of the Medicare program. Establishes a monthly catastrophic drug benefit premium for part B beneficiaries. Imposes a supplemental part B premium of $13.08 per year, adjusted annually to reflect changes in the cost of catastrophic benefits, for each $150 of income tax due in excess of $150. Sets an annual cap on the supplemental premium. Establishes the Federal Catastrophic Drug Insurance Trust Fund into which catastrophic drug benefit premiums shall be paid and the Federal Catastrophic Health Insurance Trust Fund into which the other catastrophic benefit premiums shall be paid. Covers, as home health services, daily nursing care and home health aide services furnished for up to 21 days with a physician's certification of the need for such daily care. Covers such services on a daily basis for 45 days when provided to a part B beneficiary within 30 days of his or her hospital discharge. (Currently such care must be provided on a part-time or intermittent basis.) Covers home intravenous drug therapy furnished by or under arrangements with a qualified provider in accordance with a plan established and periodically reviewed by a physician. Defines as \"homebound\" (a prerequisite of eligibility for Medicare home health services) any person who has a condition which restricts his or her ability to leave the home without support or for whom leaving the home is medically contraindicated. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to notify Medicare beneficiaries, when they apply for benefits under part A or enroll under part B, and in November 1987 and annually thereafter, regarding the extent of and limitations on Medicare coverage, including the ways in which coverage differs between those who are and those who are not covered under part B. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) enter into agreements with private or public nonprofit organizations to provide training and technical assistance to prepare volunteers to counsel elderly Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries regarding their eligibility for such benefits and assist such beneficiaries in applying for those benefits; and (2) reimburse volunteers for expenses incurred in receiving such training or providing such services. Requires the Secretary to take into account the costs incurred by organizations providing health care on a prepaid basis as a result of this Act's amendments in modifying contracts with such organizations. Requires such organizations to adjust their agreements with Medicare beneficiaries in consideration of such amendments. Requires a health maintenance organization (HMO) to notify individuals who are enrolled or eligible to enroll with such organization that the organization can terminate or refuse to renew its contract with the Secretary and that this may result in the termination of an individual's enrollment with the organization.
