    "text": "National Acid Deposition Reduction Act of 1987 - Title I: Stationary Sources - Amends the Clean Air Act to establish an acid deposition control program. Requires Statewide emission reductions in sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen from utility boilers in two phases, phase I ending in 1993 and phase II ending in 1996. Requires the Governor of each State to submit to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency a plan containing enforceable reduction measures. Excludes specified units from computations of Statewide average emissions rates. Sets sulfur dioxide emissions limitations for industrial boilers after 1996. Requires each Governor to submit to the Administrator a plan with enforceable reduction measures. Directs the Administrator to identify nonelectric fossil fuel fired steam generating units which could achieve a specified emission rate of nitrogen oxides utilizing burner retrofit technology or methods of comparable cost. Requires the Administrator to transmit to each State an inventory of total nitrogen oxide emission reductions which can be achieved by using such or comparable technology. Requires each Governor to submit to the Administrator a plan including emission limitation and compliance schedules. Requires the Administrator to conduct and update an annual inventory of emissions of sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen from stationary sources, identifying potential, economically achievable reductions which shall be transmitted to each State. Requires each State to submit to the Administrator a plan with emission limitations and compliance schedules for emissions from stationary sources of industrial process emissions. Directs the Administrator to publish guidance for State emissions reduction plans. Makes such plans a requirement under approved State implementation plans (SIP). Grants States an opportunity to modify such plans. Requires units subject to such emission limitations to certify to the State the method of compliance, including fuel substitution and facility shutdown. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to States to develop such plans. Establishes emissions limitations for units in States without an approved plan. Requires such units to submit to the Administrator a plan and compliance schedule that are enforceable and contain monitoring requirements. Sets forth methods which may be used, including: (1) energy conservation as the first priority; (2) least emissions dispatch; (3) source retirement; (4) trading of reduction requirements within State; (5) precombustion cleaning of fuels; and (6) low sulfur coal substitution. Prohibits increases in sulfur dioxide emission rates from major stationary sources in operation before 1988 without identifying corresponding offsets within the State. Requires major stationary sources beginning operations after 1987 to identify such offsets as well. Permits the use of offsets in another State within the same administrative region as specified. Establishes emission limitations for sulfur dioxide for units 30 years and older. Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to owners or operators of sources covered by this Act to assist their achievement of emission reductions, utilizing funds in the Acid Deposition Reduction Trust Fund. Limits assistance to 70 percent of capital costs and 30 percent of operating costs, as well as other restrictions. Requires the Administrator to establish a priority list of sources and strategies for such funds, emphasizing cost effectiveness and environmental and health benefits. Directs the Administrator to revise standards for emissions of nitrogen oxides for electric utility steam generating units burning bituminous or subbituminous coal. Requires the Administrator to promulgate standards for such emissions from nonelectric utility units which are new sources over a certain capacity. Requires primary nonferrous smelters to be in compliance with applicable emission standards by 1988. Authorizes the Administrator to restrict stack height. Requires the Administrator to review existing major sources to determine the sufficiency of emissions limitations based on modeling credit for stack height, requiring the State to make corrections. Directs the Administrator to modify new surce performance standards for such units to prohibit stack heights in excess of good engineering practice. Title II: Clean Coal Technology - Clean Coal Technologies Act of 1987 - Amends the Clean Air Act to implement the recommendations of the Special Envoys concerning acid depositions and transboundary air pollution by securing near-term reductions in the movement of air pollutants from the United States into Canada. Directs the Secretary of Energy, acting jointly with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to carry out a program of construction and operation of facilities to develop experience in the commercial deployment of clean coal technologies which significantly reduce air emissions of sulfur dioxide or oxides of nitrogen from the generation of electricity or industrial process steam. Includes within such program the solicitation, selection, supervision, monitoring, and dissemination of information about results of proposed projects to deploy such technologies. Requires project selection to be based on applicability to existing coal-fired sources of emission, reductions achievable, and cost-effectiveness, including the ability to use feedstock coal mined in the United States. Prohibits the application of reductions achieved through this program to reductions required under a State implementation plan. Limits Federal funds to 70 percent of costs over a five year period. Directs the Secretary and the Administrator to establish a Clean Coal Technologies Advisory Committee to select projects. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1992. Allows clean coal technology project expenditures as a public utility operating expense, as part of the rate base, or as an amortizable cost, as specified. Permits exemptions from otherwise applicable requirements for participation in a project under this Act, including the prohibition against using natural gas in a major fuel burning, coal-fired installation. Title III: Acid Deposition Reduction Trust Fund - Establishes in the Treasury the Acid Deposition Reduction Trust Fund to be used for emissions reductions grants to owners and operators, the clean coal technology deployment program, and for State reduction plans and national standards implementation. Imposes fees through 2017 on emissions of sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen from major stationary sources and on emissions of oxides of nitrogen from light-duty motor vehicles. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish rates at a level which will collect a specified amount of funds through 1997, 2007, and 2017 with two-thirds of such funds coming from sulfur dioxide emissions. Sets sulfur dioxide emission rates at increasing per ton rates for increasing emissions. Requires that such fees be paid by the operator of each major source of such emissions and by the ultimate purchaser in the case of light-duty motor vehicles. Authorizes the Secretary to adjust such rates in the light of experience or the installation of a technological system of continuous emission reduction. Requires the Secretary to report annually to the Congress on the current and projected condition of such Fund. Title IV: Mobile Sources - Amends the Clean Air Act to establish emission standards for oxides of nitrogen for: (1) light-duty vehicles and engines during and after model year 1990; (2) heavy-duty vehicles and engines during and after model years 1991 and 1995; and (3) light-duty trucks and engines during and after model year 1990. Extends the useful life of a vehicle for purposes of emissions and fuel standards under this Act. Suspends or revokes a certificate of conformity if fewer than 90 percent of the new vehicles or engines tested in a sampling conform with applicable regulations. Requires vehicle emission control inspection and maintenance programs after 1987 to require emissions testing or direct inspection of components of vehicle emissions control systems and the repair or replacement of inoperative parts. Limits the sulfur content in diesel fuel sold for use in motor vehicles after July 1, 1988. Requires the use of on board hydrocarbon control technology for any model year after 1990. Limits the Reid vapor pressure of gasoline after 1988. Title V: Other Provisions - Amends the Clean Air Act to direct the Administrator to propose national primary ambient air quality standards for sulfur dioxide and for nitrogen dioxide concentrations over a period of not more than one hour unless such standard is determined not necessary to protect public health. Establishes standards for 1990 and after should the Administrator fail to act. Requires the Administrator to propose a revised national primary ambient air quality standard for ozone concentrations over a one-hour period, unless found unnecessary to protect human health. Establishes a standard for July 1, 1991, and after should the Administrator fail to act. Directs the Administrator to propose a national primary ambient air quality standard for acid aerosols and their precursors, unless it is determined that such a standard is unnecessary to protect human health. Requires that the standard be promulgated or the determination made by 1992. Requires the Administrator to propose a national secondary ambient air quality standard for ozone concentrations unless it is determined that such standard is unnecessary to protect natural resources or other elements of the public welfare. Requires that the standard be promulgated or the determination made by 1992. Requires that such standard be different from the primary one absent a determination that the primary standard will protect the public welfare. Directs the Administrator to propose a national secondary ambient air quality standard for fine particulates, unless it is determined that such standard is unnecessary to protect natural resources or other elements of the public welfare. Requires that the standard be promulgated or the determination made by 1992. Requires States to conduct separate public hearings on the implementation of national secondary ambient air quality standards. Requires the implementation of secondary standards for ozone or fine particles to be attained within three years of an approved State plan. Permits extensions as specified. Requires each Governor to submit to the Administrator a report identifying sensitive and critically sensitive aquatic and terrestrial resources within such State. Directs the Administrator to publish guidance for such reports and authorizes the making of grants to States for preparing such report. Requires the Administrator to prepare reports for States not submitting an approvable report. Requires the Administrator to propose a national inventory of such resources based on such reports. Directs the Administrator to promulgate within three years a national standard for acid deposition sufficient to protect sensitive and critically sensitive aquatic resources. Authorizes the Administrator to promulgate acid deposition standards to protect terrestrial resources. Requires each Governor with sensitive or critically sensitive aquatic or terrestrial areas to submit to the Administrator by 1993 a deposition control plan to protect such resources. Requires such plan to identify sources both within and outside the State where emission reductions are necessary to meet the applicable standard. Requires the Administrator to provide guidance and authorizes grants to assist States. Directs the Administrator to set forth a plan for a State which has not submitted an approvable plan. Requires State implementation plans to be modified by 1994 and by 1998 to reflect the emissions limitations determined to be necessary under such deposition control plans. Directs the Administrator to publish and update a criteria document on the deposition of acid compounds. Requires State implementation plans for national primary ambient air quality standards to prohibit emissions from stationary sources which contribute to atmospheric concentrations or loadings of pollutants or transformation products which could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the public health, welfare, or environment of another State or country. Requires the Administrator to promulgate implementing regulations by 1989. Amends the Acid Precipitation Act of 1980 to revise the scope of the comprehensive program under such Act to include an evaluation of the effectiveness of the acid deposition control and clean coal technologies programs as well as the effects of other transported air pollutants such as ozone. Makes the Administrator solely accountable for the progress of such program. Requires the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint a research director for such program. Requires the Acid Precipitation Task Force to transmit to the Congress and the President by 1990 an assessment of the research results obtained by the program, including an evaluation of policy alternatives and control strategies. Increases the authorization of appropriations."
