    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1987-03-06", 
    "text": "Family Farm Act - Title I: Agricultural Commodity Supply Management - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949, effective for the 1988 through 2000 crop years, to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct referendums among crop and milk producers every four years to determine whether an agricultural commodity supply management program (program) shall be in effect for such period. (States that if a referendum is not approved current price support provisions shall apply.) Administers such program through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). Establishes program commodity loan rates at 70 percent of parity beginning with the 1988 crop year, and increasing by one percent per year to a maximum of 80 percent for the 1998 through 2000 crop years. (Eliminates target prices and other subsidy payments.) Directs the Secretary to conduct a study and report to the Congress prior to the beginning of the 1993 crop year regarding the economic impact of this Act and the continuation of such loan schedule. Directs the Secretary to: (1) proclaim a national marketing quota for each commodity based upon domestic and export demands, food aid requirements, and carryover and reserve requirements; and (2) proclaim a national acreage allotment based upon projected national yield and expected underplantings. Requires producers to apply for farm acreage allotments. Limits acreage increases to not more than 20 percent of the previous year's acreage. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a conservation use set-aside program if a commodity's projected production will exceed its national marketing quota. Increases set-aside percentages as projected production increases. Limits such maximum percentage to 35 percent. Authorizes a paid diversion program if further production decreases are necessary. Limits nonprogram crop production under specified conditions. Provides for the assignment of marketing certificates based upon the number of permitted acres times a farm's program yields. Provides for quantity reductions due to on-farm use. Authorizes excess commodities to be stored and marketed under a certificate issued in a subsequent year, or donated or sold for famine relief to the CCC. Requires importers to obtain such certificates. Limits the conditions of their use. Directs the Secretary to establish a farmers disaster reserve, to be initially stocked by CCC commodities and afterwards by producer contributions. Limits maximum individual assistance. Sets forth penalties for program noncompliance. Makes conforming amendments to specified Acts. Permits family-size livestock and poultry producers to purchase CCC grain for a 36-month period beginning 30 days after enactment of this Act. Limits maximum annual purchases. Title II: Milk Marketing Control - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to direct the Secretary to conduct referendums among milk producers every four years to determine whether an alternative milk price support program (program) shall be in effect for such period. (States that if a referendum is not approved current price support provisions shall apply.) Establishes milk price support levels at 70 percent of parity beginning in 1988, and increasing by one-percent per year to a maximum of 80 percent for 1998 through 2000. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study and report to the Congress before January 1, 1993, regarding the economic impact of this Act and the continuation of such support schedule. States that the Secretary shall determine individual milk marketing bases for each year such program is in effect. Bases such amount on the product of the producers' marketing history (1981 through 1985) and the annual marketing allocation factor (based on domestic and export needs and production quantities). Permits the transfer of milk marketing bases, subject to specified conditions and with priority given to family members and beginning producers. Title III: Agricultural Exports and Imports - Subtitle A: Agricultural Exports - Amends the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 to provide for multilateral famine relief agreements. Authorizes the use of CCC surplus stocks for such purposes. Subtitle B: Agricultural Imports - Directs the Secretary to use specified import limitation authority under the Agricultural Adjustment Act to prevent imported commodities from interfering with domestic price support activities. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require country of origin labeling for any agricultural product containing a significant (by volume or value) portion of imported ingredients. Prohibits the importation of commodities, live animals used for food, or food items containing residues of chemicals prohibited for use in the United States. Title IV: Food and Nutrition Assistance - Subtitle A: General Food and Nutrition Programs - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to direct the Secretary to increase food stamp benefits to offset any food price increases resulting from this Act. Makes similar amendments to the National School Lunch Act (school lunch program), and the Child Nutrition Act of 1986 (school breakfast program and the supplemental food program for women, infants, and children (WIC)). Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to: (1) adjust the cost of the thrifty food plan; (2) exclude child support payments from income for purposes of food stamp eligibility; (3) increase excess shelter expense deduction caps; (4) amend the allowable deduction for excess medical expenses of the elderly and disabled; (5) increase the limitations on financial resources; (6) permit the use of administrative funds to provide program information to unemployed, disabled, or elderly persons; (7) increase FY 1988 through 1990 appropriations; (8) authorize outreach programs for the homeless; (9) provide separate household status for certain children and siblings; and (10) provide food stamps within five days of application to the homeless and to persons whose combined gross income and liquid resources is less than their monthly rent and utilities. Amends the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983 to increase FY 1987 authorizations, and authorize FY 1988 authorizations, for the temporary emergency food assistance (TEFAP) program. Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to replace the current specific FY 1989 WIC authorization with an authorization of necessary funds for FY 1989. Increases the authorization of appropriations for nutrition education and training.

Provides that the comprehensive plan shall be carried out during the period ending with the close of the ninth fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the final comprehensive plan is submitted. Requires the Secretaries to provide for and coordinate such scientific research and development as may be necessary to support the coordinated program and comprehensive plan. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the President to establish a National Nutrition Monitoring Advisory Council to: (1) provide scientific and technical advice on the development and implementation of all components of the coordinated program and the comprehensive plan; (2) evaluate such program and plan; and (3) submit an annual report to the Secretaries.

Directs the Secretary to establish a Review Board for such purpose. Chapter 5: Administrative Provisions - Provides 50 percent matching grants to States to offset the costs of such mediation program. Limits annual payments to any State to $1,000,000. Sets forth provisions regarding the participation of affected Federal agencies, including the Farm Credit Administration. Requires the Secretary to submit a program report to the Congress by January 15 of each fiscal year.
