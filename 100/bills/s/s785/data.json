Authorizes appropriations and establishes provisions for services for dislocated workers. Makes the Governor of a State responsible for carrying out programs under this Act through a Secretary/Governor agreement. Requires each State to ensure the establishment of a rapid response capability, either directly or through substate grantees, to assess the need for, and to provide, early readjustment assistance. Includes in such assistance the formation of voluntary joint labor management committees. Requires each State to establish linkages between the unemployment compensation system and the worker readjustment program system. Provides that such linkages may include financial incentives to employers through amendments to the State unemployment compensation law. Requires such linkages to include: (1) criteria for early identification of those having the most difficulty in finding employment; (2) mechanisms for early referral of individuals to readjustment services; (3) methods to prepare the unemployment compensation system to coordinate with the worker readjustment service; and (4) measures to ensure that participants in readjustment assistance services are exempted from work search requirements. Sets forth administrative requirements for a State in providing readjustment services. Requires a Governor to designate substate areas to consist of one or more service delivery areas.

Requires that an opportunity be provided for labor organizations to comment on work or training proposals. Requires the Secretary of Labor to report annually to the Congress on worker readjustment programs under this title. Provides for the allotment of funds for basic readjustment services and the selection of service providers. Lists various types of allowable basic readjustment services and activities.

Directs the Secretary to establish a Federal Worker Readjustment Advisory Council to recommend ways to improve the effectiveness of programs and services under this title. Requires, in making appointments to private industry councils and State training and employment councils, that recognition be given to responsibilities of such councils under the Wagner-Peyser Act. Changes the name of the State job training coordinating councils to State training and employment councils and revises the membership on such councils. Title II: Wagner-Peyser Act Amendments - Employment Services Act of 1987 - Amends the Wagner-Peyser Act to direct the Secretary to disseminate information that may be of assistance to States in the provision of public employment services and maintain a system for clearing labor between the States. Eliminates reference to the United States Employment Service. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with the Governor of any State for: (1) reimbursements to such State for carrying out authorities vested in the Secretary; and (2) reimbursement to the Department of Labor for carrying out certain activities requested by a State. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the Governor of Guam under which Guam will provide public employment services after July 1, 1990. Authorizes appropriations for such purpose. Requires a State to enter into a compliance agreement with the Secretary in order to obtain financial assistance under this Act. (Currently, State legislatures must provide for acceptance of assistance through the designation or creation of a State agency to cooperate with the U.S. Employment Service.) Authorizes appropriations for each fiscal year as necessary. Requires a State, in providing public employment services, to give particular attention to the need for: (1) assessment and testing activities for identifying worker strengths and weaknesses; (2) labor market information to workers and employers; (3) vocational counseling, job search, and job finding skills training to workers capable of finding their own jobs; and (4) referral to programs under the Job Training Partnership Act, educational institutions, private placement agencies, social service agencies, and referral of workers for placement in specific positions.
