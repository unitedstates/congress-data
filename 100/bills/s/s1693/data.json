Disclaims any intent to enlarge or diminish the responsibility of any party under State or Federal law for proper management of such lands or for management or actions related to hazardous substances or materials located on such lands. Requires the Secretary to advise appropriate Federal, State, and county officials, prior to consummating the exchange, of any information the Secretary has concerning hazardous substances or materials located on such lands. Directs the Secretary to: (1) resurvey and prepare a new plat for the townsite of Veteran, Wyoming, to take into account the actual use of streets and alleys on such lands for designation as public reservations; and (2) patent such reservation lands to Goshen County. Provides for an exchange of forest lands between Farmington City, Utah, and the Secretary of Agriculture. Directs the the Secretary of Agriculture, within three years of the date of enactment of this Act, to identify city or State lands which are suitable for transfer to the United States for national forest purposes. Specifies that any such lands exchanged shall be of equal value (as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture) or equalized by payment to or by the Secretary of Agriculture, as long as the payment does not exceed 25 percent of the total value of the lands transferred out of Federal ownership. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriuclture, in lieu of such an exchange, to transfer by sale for fair market value such Federal lands to the city or State of Utah, as appropriate. Withdraws all public lands within Kanab City, Utah, from all forms of entry and appropriation under the public lands laws, including the mining laws, and from operation of the mineral and geothermal leasing laws. Terminates such withdrawal five years after the date of the enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to determine which public lands withdrawn meet the disposal criteria specified in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 and to notify Kanab City concerning such determination. Grants Kanab City, for the four-year period beginning on the date of enactment, the exclusive right to purchase any such withdrawn lands that the Secretary has determined to be suitable for disposal. Provides for the public sale of such lands after the expiration of such period, but gives Kanab City the opportunity to meet the high bid offered by any other party. Specifies that all such sales of public lands shall be for fair market value and subject to valid existing rights, as well as subject to any conditions to (or any patent issued in consequence of) such sale as the Secretary determines necessary or appropriate. Authorizes the Secretary to release and quitclaim to the city of Riverdale, Utah, for fair market value all right, title, and interest of the United States in specified property, provided that the city requests such action within one year after the enactment of this Act. Provides that all funds received by the United States shall be credited to the land and water conservation fund of the Treasury and shall be available for expenditure under the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a study to determine the feasibility and desirability of protecting and preserving lands and resources associated with the western terminus of the Oregon Trail in Oregon City, Oregon; (2) consult with interested Federal agencies and State and local bodies; (3) coordinate the study with applicable outdoor recreation plans and related plans for the preservation of historic and natural resources in the area; and (4) report his or her findings and recommendations to specified congressional committees.

Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to permit entry on desert lands which are part of a scenic easement area of the Dinosaur National Monument, Utah, to certain applicants who convey certain scenic easements to the United States. Michigan Public Lands Improvement Act of 1988 - Grants to the State of Michigan the right, title, and interest of the United States in and to certain public uplands and islands in Michigan waters which were not subject to any claim on January 1, 1988. Allows the Secretary of the Interior to sell certain other lands which were subject to a claim identified on the records of the Bureau of Land Management as of that date to the claimants following resolution of conflicting claims. Deems title to public lands which, on the date of enactment of this Act, was subject to leases issued to the State of Michigan under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act to have vested in the State and to be exempt from Department of the Interior regulations governing leases under such Act. Allows the State to receive, under this Act, lands previously patented to the State under such Act by notifying the Secretary that it intends to relinquish such lands to the United States. Requires the Secretary to transfer such lands back to the State subject to the provisions of this Act, effective simultaneously with the State's relinquishment of such lands. Authorizes the Secretary to sell and issue a patent to a tract of public land located in Michigan where the Secretary determines that: (1) such tract does not exceed 1,500 acres and is difficult and uneconomic to manage as part of the public lands and is not suitable for management by another Federal department or agency; and (2) such sale would not be inconsistent with land use plans developed in accordance with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Allows the Secretary, following adjudication of any claims, to convey such land at fair market value, less equities presented by an applicant for such conveyance (such as the amount paid for the land, longevity of the applicant's claim, and taxes paid on the land) and less the value of any improvements. Provides for description of tracts of such land conveyed on the approved Federal plat of survey. Authorizes the Secretary to either: (1) convey title to a qualified trustee, where a tract does not conform to an existing survey plat, in order to conform the legal description to such plat; or (2) require the applicant to reimburse the United States for the cost of preparing a plat of survey. Prohibits the sale of such lands unless the Secretary, before 30 days prior to such sale, publishes notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the tract is located. Reserves to the United States all mineral rights in the lands transferred under this Act. Prohibits the conveyance or transfer of such lands by Michigan to any person or entity other than a political subdivision of the State. Authorizes the use of such lands only for purposes of public recreation or protection of fish, wildlife, plants, or other natural resources and values. Directs the Secretary to take steps to notify Michigan residents of the uplands and islands to be granted or otherwise transferred to the State. Requires Michigan to notify the Secretary with regard to any grant or transfer of such lands by the State to a political subdivision. Requires the State to submit to the Secretary a report within five years of enactment of this Act, and every five years thereafter, as to the present ownership, management, and use of the lands granted or otherwise transferred. Sets forth enforcement procedures. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed as affecting the jurisdiction or responsibilities of the State with respect to fish and wildlife in any lands granted or transferred to the State under this Act.

Wright to certain lands in Lamar County, Alabama. Waives the 160-acre limitation on conveyances under the Color-of-Title Act for any claim for a patent that may be filed under such Act for a specified parcel of land in Sumter County, Alabama. Declares that the Southern Pacific Transportation Company has abandoned certain real property situated in Alameda County, California, forming a part of the right-of-way granted by the United States to the Central Pacific Railway Company. Retains all Federal right, title, and interest in such property for management by the Secretary of the Interior as a public recreational trail, and for other recreational purposes compatible with trail use. Exempts specified property embraced within a certain public highway from such Federal interest. Reserves to the United States all oil, coal, or other minerals in such property, including prospecting, mining, and removal rights. Restricts to public highway and related uses under California law that portion of the property embraced within a certain public highway. States that all rights and interests revert back to the United States if: (1) any portion of such property is used for purposes unauthorized by this Act; or (2) if an attempt is made to transfer ownership of such property to any party other than the State of California.
