Requires the Secretary to report annually in writing to tribes in each service area regarding projected and actual staffing levels, funding obligations, and expenditures for programs operated directly by the Secretary. Provides that if unexpended funds under a self-determination contract are to be carried over from one year to the next for the purposes for which they were originally appropriated, or for which they are specifically authorized to be used, the tribal organization does not need additional justification or documentation. Title II: Indian Self-Determination Act Amendments - Directs the Secretary, upon the request of any Indian tribe or tribal organization (currently, Indian tribe) to enter into a self-determination contract (currently, contract) with such Indian tribe or tribal organization, for: (1) the transfer of certain hospitals and health services; (2) construction programs administered by the Secretary for which appropriations are made to agencies other than the Department of Health and Human Services or the Department of the Interior; and (3) any program for the benefit of Indians without regard to the agency of the Department of Health and Human Services or the Department of the Interior within which it is performed. Requires the Secretary, within 90 days after receiving a proposal for a self-determination contract from an authorized tribal organization, to approve it (currently, may initially findings decline to enter into a contract) unless he makes specified findings within 60 days.

Requires the Secretary, no later than FY 1989, to begin using the calendar year as the basis for contracts and agreements under this Act. Requires the Secretary, within 90 days of the enactment of this Act, to submit a report to the Congress on the amounts of any additional obligational authority needed to implement this Act in FY 1988 and 1989. Sets forth procedures for the retrocession of contracts entered into pursuant to this Act. Authorizes the appropriate Secretary, in connection with self-determination contracts, to: (1) donate to an Indian tribe or tribal organization the title to any personal property exceeding the needs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Indian Health Service or the General Services Administration, including purchases made with funds under self-determination contracts; and (2) acquire excess or surplus Government property for donation to an Indian tribe. Provides that the funds for self-determination contracts: (1) shall include all allowable costs incurred by an Indian tribe or tribal organization in connection with such contract; (2) shall not be reduced to make funding available for contract monitoring; (3) shall not be less than the appropriate Secretary would have otherwise provided for direct operation of the programs; (4) shall not be reduced by the Secretary in subsequent years except by a reduction in congressional appropriations; (5) shall not be reduced by the Secretary to pay for Federal functions or for the costs of Federal personnel displaced by a self-determination contract; and (6) may, at the request of the tribal organization, be increased by the Secretary if necessary to carry out such Act. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of the Interior to report annually to the Congress on the implementation of this Act. Prohibits any adverse adjustment to a tribal organization's indirect cost rate if allowable recoveries are below the level of indirect costs that such organization should have received for any given year if the shortfall is the result of full indirect cost funding by any Federal, State, or other agency. Provides that Indian tribes and tribal organizations shall not be held liable for indebtedness attributable to theoretical or actual underrecoveries or theoretical overrecoveries of indirect costs. Prohibits any right of action or other remedy (other than those relating to a criminal offense) relating to any disallowance of costs unless the Secretary gives specified notice. Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from removing or altering any program in the Indian priority system unless approved by an act of the Congress. Requires notice of intent to change any program in such system. Requires the Secretary to add indirect costs to the amount of funds provided for direct costs for self-determination contracts for the first year and for each subsequent year that the program remains continuously under contract. Requires the Secretary, in calculating the indirect costs associated with a self-determination contract for a construction program, to consider only those costs associated with the administration of the contract. Directs the Secretary, within one month after the enactment of this Act, to establish a team of Bureau personnel and tribal representatives to: (1) analyze the Indian Priority System and other aspects of the Bureau's budgeting and funding allocation process; and (2) report to the Congress on recommendations for achieving greater tribal decision-making authority over the use of appropriated funds for the benefit of the tribes. Gives to the Federal district courts original jurisdiction over any civil action or claim against the appropriate Secretary arising under this Act. Gives concurrent jurisdiction to the United States Claims Court over such actions against the Secretary for money damages. Prohibits the Secretary from revising or amending a self-determination contract unless otherwise agreed to by resolution of the tribe. Applies the Equal Access to Justice Act to administrative appeals by Indian tribes and tribal organizations regarding self-determination contracts. Applies the Contract Disputes Act to such contracts. Authorizes an Indian tribe or tribal organization, within 120 days after receiving a copy of a decision of an agency board of contract appeals, to appeal to: (1) a U.S. district court; or (2) the United States Claims Court. Authorizes an Indian tribe or tribal organization to bring an action directly on the claim in such courts. Requires that all Federal requirements for self-determination contracts and grants in this Act be promulgated as regulations in conformity with the Administrative Procedure Act. Requires the Secretary to: (1) formulate regulations to implement this Act within three months of the date of enactment of this Act; (2) present the proposed regulations to the Select Committee on Indian Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs of the House within six months of the date of enactment; (3) publish the proposed regulations in the Federal Register within seven months of the date of enactment; and (4) promulgate regulations within ten months of the date of enactment. Directs the Secretary to conduct a research and demonstration project known as the Tribal Self-Governance project. Requires the Secretary to select 20 tribes to participate in the project, based upon successful completion of a Self-Governance Planning Grant and upon meeting specified criteria to achieve geographic representation and assure financial stability and financial management capability. Directs the Secretary to negotiate and enter into annual written funding agreements with the governing body of a participating tribal government which shall: (1) authorize the tribe to plan and administer certain programs, services, and functions; (2) specify the services to be provided, functions to be performed, and responsibilities of the tribe and the Secretary; (3) specify the authority of the tribe and the Secretary, and the procedures to be used, to reallocate funds or modify budget allocations within any project year; (4) provide for certain payments by the Secretary to the tribe of funds from one or more programs, services, functions, or activities in an amount equal to that which the tribe would have been eligible to receive under contracts and grants under this Act and for any funds specifically or functionally related to the provision by the Secretary of services and benefits to the tribe and its members; (5) preclude the Secretary from waiving, modifying, or in any way diminishing the existing trust responsibility of the United States with respect to Indian tribes and individuals; (6) preclude the Secretary from interpreting Federal laws and regulations in a manner that would prohibit or restrict such agreements; (7) allow for retrocession of programs or portions thereof pursuant to such Act; and (8) be submitted by the Secretary 90 days in advance of the proposed effective date of the agreement to specified congressional committees. Makes the tribes responsible for the administration of programs, services, and activities pursuant to such agreements. Provides for dispute resolution.
