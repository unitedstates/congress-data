    "text": "Prohibits the obligation of any unauthorized defense appropriation unless the obligation is specifically authorized by law after the enactment of such appropriations. Provides that, of any amount appropriated to the Department of Defense (DOD) in an appropriation law, the amount that may be obligated or expended is the amount appropriated reduced by any amount determined by the Secretary of Defense to be for unauthorized programs, projects, or activities. Requires the Secretary, no later than 30 days after the enactment of an appropriation or authorization law (whichever is enacted later), to report to the Congress on any unauthorized projects, programs, or activities, as well as any amounts appropriated for such projects, programs, or activities. Directs the Comptroller General to review each such report and report to the Congress if: (1) the law with respect to which the Secretary submitted a report provides appropriations for an unauthorized program, project, or activity in addition to those identified by the Secretary; or (2) a program, project, or activity identified in the report as unauthorized is not unauthorized. Defines an unauthorized program, project, or activity as one for which an amount is provided under a defense appropriation exceeding the amount authorized to be appropriated for such program, project, or activity in a law other than an appropriation law. Provides that if, as of the first day of a fiscal year no authorization of appropriations has been enacted specifically for DOD operations, then funds appropriated or otherwise made available for that fiscal year may be obligated for pay for civilian personnel, operation and maintenance activities, and research, development, test, and evaluation activities. Provides the rate at which such funds may be obligated. Terminates such general continuing authority upon subsequent enactment of a law specifically authorizing appropriations for such purposes for a fiscal year. Provides that this Act shall not apply to permanent appropriations and trust funds for DOD. Provides that the provisions of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 shall not apply to an unauthorized defense appropriation. Provides that nothing in this Act shall affect the application of a specified provision of the National Security Act of 1947 relating to obligations and expenditures for intelligence-related activities within the Central Intelligence Agency. Provides that funds may not be appropriated for any fiscal year for the military functions of DOD for any of the following purposes unless such funds are specifically authorized by a law other than an appropriation law: (1) procurement; (2) research, development, test, or evaluation; (3) operation and maintenance; (4) a DOD working-capital fund; or (5) military construction."
