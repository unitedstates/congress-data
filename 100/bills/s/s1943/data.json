Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) to use not to exceed one percent of the amounts appropriated for the allotments in each of FY 1988 through 1991 to conduct evaluations and prepare reports concerning the effectiveness of the block grant programs. Revises the formula for determination and distribution of the allotments. Sets forth requirements for allotment applications, including requirements that the chief executive officer of each State certify: (1) that the funds will be used for comprehensive mental health services and community mental health centers; (2) that the State will establish reasonable evaluation criteria; (3) the specific purposes for which the funds will be used; (4) that the State will use the funds for specified alcohol and drug abuse activities; (5) that the State will use certain funds to provide new mental health services and programs; and (6) other matters.
