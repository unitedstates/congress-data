    "text": "Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 - Title I: Commerce - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require the Federal Communications Commission, prior to the transfer of a construction permit or broadcast station license, to assess and collect from the transferor a charge of two percent of the selling price or of the fair market value, whichever is greater. Increases the charge to three percent if the transfer has violated the Fairness Doctrine. Increases such charge to four percent (five percent if the transfer has violated the Fairness Doctrine) if the Commission finds that the transfer has not operated the station for more than three years, unless: (1) the application involves only an FM translator station or FM booster station; (2) the application involves a pro forma assignment or transfer of control; (3) the transferor has made an affirmative factual showing that because of materially changed circumstances subsequent to the acquisition of the license or permit, a change in ownership will serve the public interest; or (4) the disposal of the permit or license was authorized in accordance with regulations concerning minority ownership of broadcast stations. Prohibits the Commission from waiving or deferring such charge. Provides that moneys received from such charge shall be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury until September 30, 1989, and thereafter in the Public Broadcasting Trust Fund to be established by the Secretary of the Treasury. Provides that such Fund shall be used solely: (1) by the Secretary of Commerce for the planning and construction of public telecommunications facilities; and (2) for the Public Broadcasting Fund to provide financial support for public broadcasting. Requires the Commission, in establishing the fair market value of a construction permit or license that is disposed of, to include the price of the permit or license and all items of value disposed of, without regard to whether the disposition of such items occurs between the same persons or in the same transaction. Authorizes appropriations of a specified amount for FY 1989, and of a specified percentage of the Public Broadcasting Trust Fund for fiscal years after FY 1989, for the planning and construction of public telecommunications facilities. Limits to a specified portion of the Public Broadcasting Trust Fund the appropriations authorized for the Public Broadcasting Fund for fiscal years after FY 1990. Requires broadcast licensees to provide reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on issues of public importance, consistent with the Commission's rules in effect on January 1, 1987. Requires the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is located to establish a system for the collection of $50,000,000 in FY 1988 through 1990 in payments by users of the Coast Guard's services, except for emergency search and rescue. Requires that such a system include payments from: (1) the sale of Support of Services Stamps which entitle the holder to specified services without charge; and (2) fees collected from users of such specified services who have not purchased a Support of Services Stamp. Requires the Secretary to consider collecting payments for non-emergency search and rescue and to ensure that such a collection system minimizes the adverse economic effects upon commercial towing services and other segments of the maritime industry. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress by December 1, 1987, on the establishment of such a system and by December 1, 1988, on the implementation of such a system. Title II: Committee on Energy and Natural Resources - Subtitle A: Nuclear Waste - Nuclear Waste Policy Act Amendments Act of 1987 - Amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to add a new \"Title IV: Program Redirection\". Directs the Secretary of Energy to select by January 1, 1989, as the preferred site for the first repository, one of the sites previously selected for characterization as a candidate site. Sets forth the criteria for such site consideration. Prohibits the Secretary from initiating exploratory shaft facility construction until such preferred site has been selected. Makes the State in which the preferred site is located eligible to enter into a benefits agreement with the Secretary. Subjects the Secretary's site selection decision to an expedited judicial review process. Grants the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals exclusive jurisdiction over such decision. Prescribes procedural guidelines for such decision, including an environmental evaluation. Requires an economic impact report to Congress within one year after site selection. Annuls and revokes the Secretary's previous proposal to locate a monitored retrievable storage facility on the Clinch River (Oak Ridge, Tennessee). Prescribes a deadline by which the Secretary must survey and evaluate three potentially suitable sites in at least two States for such a facility. Sets forth: (1) the factors to be considered at each site; and (2) notification requirements and local approval procedures. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to any State, Indian tribe, or local government to support an assessment of the feasibility of siting a monitored retrievable storage facility. Requires the Secretary to construct and operate such a facility, once selection is effective, as part of an integrated nuclear waste management system. Directs the Secretary to conduct a feasibility study regarding additional monitored retrievable storage facilities which shall: (1) examine the desirability of co-locating a monitored retrievable storage facility site for spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear activities with a site at which substantial volumes of high-level radioactive waste from atomic energy defense activities are located; and (2) include the development of a management plan for such high-level radioactive waste in a system with additional monitored retrievable storage facilities capable of storing both high-level radioactive and spent nuclear fuel. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress by April 1, 1989, on the study results. Sets a time frame within which the Secretary must study and evaluate the use of dry cask storage technology at civilian nuclear power reactor sites for the temporary storage of spent nuclear fuel until a permanent geologic repository is operative for such purpose. Prescribes the contents of such study and directs the Secretary to report on it to the Congress by October 1, 1988. Requires a report to the Congress by April 1, 1989, on the benefits of storing for at least 50 years spent nuclear fuel compared to the current system design allowing such fuel to age for ten years before emplacement in a repository. Prescribes guidelines under which the Secretary may enter into benefits agreements with eligible States or Indian tribes on whose property a repository or monitored retrievable storage facility is sited. Mandates that a review panel be established under such benefits agreements to: (1) advise the Secretary regarding proposed repositories or monitored retrievable storage facilities and related issues; (2) evaluate performance; (3) recommend corrective actions; and (4) participate in data planning and review. Exempts such panel from the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Prohibits the Secretary from conducting site-specific activities regarding a second repository while benefits agreements are in effect (unless the Congress specifically appropriates funds for such activities). Requires the Secretary to report to the President and the Congress by January 1, 2007, on the need for a second repository. Cites conditions under which the Secretary may terminate a benefits agreement. Declares that the Secretary's benefits termination decisions shall be available to the Congress and the public and are not subject to judicial review. Requires the Secretary to offer any affected State, Indian tribe, or local government an opportunity to designate a representative to conduct on-site oversight activities at a monitored retrievable storage facility. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1990. Requires the Secretary, within 60 days after enactment of this Act, to seek to enter into a contract with the National Academy of Sciences for a study regarding the major facets of reprocessing spent nuclear fuel. Requires the Secretary to submit the Academy's report to the Congress by September 30, 1989. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on subseabed disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. Prescribes the contents of such report. Prohibits the transportation of spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste by or for the Secretary unless in packages that have been certified for such purpose by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Directs the Secretary to: (1) abide by the Commission's regulations regarding advance notification of State and local governments prior to transportation of spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste; and (2) provide States with technical assistance and funds for training public safety officials through whose jurisdiction the Secretary plans to transport radioactive materials. Requires the Commission to: (1) require actual tests on a sample full-scale package (in addition to any simulated tests, scale model test, or engineered analysis) as part of its package design certification process for spent nuclear fuel or radioactive waste transportation; and (2) conduct a survey of the radioactive waste transportation packages used by other nations and report the survey results to the Congress by January 1, 1989. Mandates that the repository site approval procedure include a statement by the Secretary (after consultation with the Secretary of Defense) that repository construction and operation will not seriously jeopardize or interfere with national defense activities. Grants any State which borders on a State in which a candidate repository site is located, and lies contiguous to a major river, waterway, or underground aquifer adjacent to or underneath a site, the same right to participate in site selection, review, and approval as the State in which the repository is proposed to be located. Requires the Secretary, when siting Federal research projects, to give special consideration to proposals from States where a repository is located. Subtitle B: Federal Onshore Competitive and Gas Leasing Act of 1987 - Federal Onshore Competitive Oil and Gas Leasing Act of 1987 - Amends Federal law regarding competitive leasing of oil and gas for onshore Federal lands to increase from 640 acres to 2,560 acres the units of land open to competitive leasing. Provides for lease sales to be: (1) conducted by oral bidding; and (2) held at least every two months in each State (or more frequently at the Secretary's discretion). Requires the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) establish by regulation a national minimum acceptable price for all leases which is at least $10 per acre, and (2) accept the highest bid which is at least $10 or greater per acre without evaluation of the value of the lands proposed for lease. Requires that all bids for less than the minimum acceptable price be rejected. Makes lands available for leasing for a three-year period if the highest bid received for such lands was less than the minimum acceptable price. Describes circumstances under which certain lands may be leased without competitive bidding. Conditions the issuance of leases upon payment of a minimum rental of $1 per acre for each year of the lease. Authorizes the Secretary to suspend a lease and its term by adding the suspended period thereto if a lessee, due to specified circumstances beyond his control, is denied access for exploration, drilling or production purposes. Authorizes the Secretary to disapprove partial assignments of less than 640 acres outside of Alaska, or of less than 2,560 acres within Alaska. Directs the Secretary to promptly process requests for assignment of sublease approvals and to grant such approvals (where appropriate) within 60 days of receipt. Subjects a lease to cancellation by the Secretary of the Interior after 30 days' notice for noncompliance with the lease terms unless: (1) the leasehold contains a well capable of production of oil or gas in paying quantities; or (2) the lease is committed to an approved cooperative or unit plan or communitization agreement which contains a well capable of production of unitized substances in paying quantities. Exempts from the environmental impact assessment requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 actions taken by the Secretary to develop regulations and procedures for a competitive oil and gas leasing program (including lease sales). Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act to make leasing in Alaska consistent with that in the lower 48 States. Repeals provisions regarding: (1) determination of favorable petroleum geological provinces; and (2) suspension of noncompetitive leasing. Establishes an interim period during which certain pending lease applications will be processed as they would have been prior to the date of enactment of this Act. Prohibits noncompetitive lease applications for specified lands from being processed until such lands are posted for competitive bidding in accordance with this Act. Provides for the leasing of certain lands without competitive bidding to the first qualified applicant if such lands were similarly available for such noncompetitive leasing prior to the date of enactment of this Act. Terminates the lease-issuing authority under this Act 24 months after the date of issuance of final implementing regulations. Directs the Secretary to issue final regulations within 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act. States that such regulations do not require certain accompanying environmental impact analyses (including environmental impact analyses). Requires the Secretary of the Interior to hold at least one competitive lease sale for tracts which but for this Act would have been posted for the filing of simultaneous oil and gas lease applications. Permits the inclusion in such sale of certain tracts which had over-the-counter noncompetitive oil and gas lease offers. Imposes civil penalties upon persons who willfully and knowingly misrepresent the value of lands and leases under this Act. Grants to the States concurrent civil and criminal jurisdiction for violations of this Act. Requires the Secretary to submit an annual report to the Congress regarding the implementation of this Act, including specified data. Subtitle C: Park System Admission Fees - Land and Water Conservation Fund Act Amendments of 1987 - Amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 to increase from $10 to $25 the charge for the annual admission permit (the Golden Eagle Passport) into any entrance fee area of the National Park System. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to make available an annual admission permit for a reasonable fee for a specific unit or units of the National Park System. Sets fee limits for single-visit permits. Prohibits charging fees at any National Park unit located in an urbanized area. Directs the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees a list of units and their proposed admission fees. Prohibits admission fees for persons 16 years of age or less or for organized educational groups. Prohibits charges at: (1) the Statue of Liberty National Monument, New York; (2) the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial, Hawaii; and (3) Independence National Historical Park, Pennsylvania. Requires a \"Fee-Free Day\" at each unit where a fee is charged. Sets admission fee limitations for Glacier, Yellowstone, and Grand Teton National Parks. Makes admission fees available to the collecting agency for resource protection, research, interpretation, and maintenance at outdoor recreation facilities managed by that agency. Allocates 15 percent of the funds collected by the National Park Service to Park units based upon need: 35 percent for operating expenses, and 50 percent based on user and admission fees. Permits the use of such funds for resource protection, research, and interpretation, and in the case of funds from user fees, for maintenance. Authorizes volunteers or others to sell permits and collect fees if adequately trained and bonded. Permits the charge of a transportation fee in lieu of an entrance fee at parks with transportation systems. Provides for the distribution of such funds, with the park itself retaining 50 percent outright. Directs the Secretary to study the feasibility of adjusting entrance fees to encourage alternative transportation usage and visitation at off-peak times. Requires the study to include a pilot program at Yosemite National Park. Directs the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees within three years on such study. Extends the Land and Water Conservation Fund through FY 2015. Subtitle D: Tongass Timber Supply Fund - Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act to repeal the ongoing appropriations for timber utilization in the Tongass National Forest, Alaska. Authorizes appropriations to maintain a specified level of timber supply. Title III: Committee on Environment and Public Works - Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to assess user fees for certain activities administered by the Agency under statutory mandate. Amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to direct the Secretary of Energy to develop and make available to the public plans for the conduct of surface-based testing at specified candidate sites recommended for site characterization. Outlines the contents of such plans. Prohibits the Secretary from initiating exploratory shaft facility construction at any candidate site until a preferred candidate site is selected according to statutory guidelines. Directs the Secretary to: (1) publish for public comment (within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act) a description of the decision methodology to be used in selecting a preferred candidate site; (2) make available to certain affected bodies (including affected States and Indian tribes) the technical information the Secretary intends to consider in evaluating site suitability for repository development; (3) select a preferred candidate site for the first repository by January 1, 1991, based in part upon the information gained from the surface-based testing; (4) submit to the Congress (and make available to the public) a comprehensive statement of the basis for the Secretary's site selection decision; (5) immediately notify interested States, Indian tribes and the Congress if the preferred candidate site is determined to be unsuitable; and (6) select a new preferred candidate site within six months after such determination. Sets guidelines for judicial review of the Secretary's site selection decision. Grants the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals exclusive jurisdiction over such decision. Prescribes procedural guidelines for such decision and for an environmental evaluation. Directs the Secretary to enter into a contract with the National Academy of Sciences for the purpose of establishing an Oversight Board under Academy auspices to evaluate the scientific and technical adequacy of the Department of Energy's surface-based testing plans, preferred candidate site selection program, and site characterization program. Sets forth the Board's duties, including a quarterly status report on its activities. Declares that the National Environmental Policy Act is applicable to site characterization activities under this Act. Specifies exceptions to environmental impact statement requirements. Requires the Secretary to have in effect a fully qualified quality assurance program governing the data to be collected during in situ characterization of any site before proceeding to sink shafts at any candidate site. Prohibits the Secretary from conducting site-qualified activities with respect to a second repository unless the Congress has specifically authorized and appropriated funds for such activities. Directs the Secretary to: (1) report to the President and the Congress by January 1, 2010, on the need for a second repository; and (2) suspend all expenditures related to evaluating crystalline rock suitability as a potential repository host medium. Sets forth criteria for licenses issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for monitored retrievable storage facilities (MRS) dealing with spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 through 1990. Directs the NRC to assess its licensees annual charges on a fiscal year basis for FY 1988 through 1990. Prescribes a maximum amount for such charges and mandates that they be reasonably related to NRC regulatory services and costs. Amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to repeal the NRC's mandate to: (1) assess annual charges from its licensees; and (2) submit to certain congressional committees a feasibility report regarding such annual charges. Amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to set forth the amount of the nuclear waste fee adjustment for FY 1988 through 1990. Title IV: Committee on Finance - Subtitle A: Health, Social Services, and Income Security - Part A: Provisions with Major Budgetary Impact - Subpart I: Provisions Affecting Medicare Part A - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to set the applicable percentage increase in hospital prospective payment rates at one percent for hospitals paid at the urban rate and 4.2 percent for hospitals paid at the rural rate for FY 1988, at the market basket percentage increase minus two percentage points for FY 1989, and at the market basket percentage increase minus 1.6 percentage points for FY 1990. Requires the Secretary to issue, within 120 days of this Act's enactment, clear and explicit implementing instructions which set forth the manner in which a sole community hospital may apply for a Medicare payment adjustment when its patient volume declines by more than five percent due to circumstances beyond its control. Amends the Medicare program to make the payment adjustment applicable to sole community hospitals experiencing such a decline in patient volume in a cost reporting period prior to October 1, 1990 (extended from October 1, 1988.) Allows a sole community hospital to qualify for such an adjustment without regard to the formula by which its Medicare payments are determined. Amends part A (General Provisions) of title XI of the Social Security Act to require that whenever the Secretary of Health and Human Services proposes a regulation or promulgates a final version of a regulation under titles XVIII (Medicare), XIX (Medicaid), or part B (Peer Review) of title XI of the Act which will have a substantial impact on small rural hospitals, the Secretary make a regulatory impact analysis available to the public. Requires the Secretary to: (1) develop a data base of the operating costs of inpatient hospital services for a representative sample of hospitals for use in determining appropriate adjustments to the Medicare prospective payment system and analyzing legislative, regulatory, and budgetary changes; and (2) report to the Congress on such data base by October 1, 1988. Directs the Secretary to develop and place into effect a data base of the operating costs of inpatient hospital services for all Medicare hospitals by June 1, 1989. Directs the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission to evaluate a specified study conducted by the Secretary into the feasibility and impact of eliminating or phasing out separate urban and rural prospective payment rates and report its conclusions and recommendations to the Congress by March 1, 1988. Amends the Medicare program to require the Secretary to regularly update the index representing the proportion of hospital costs attributable to wages on the basis of a survey of the wage-related costs of Medicare hospitals. Treats certain hospitals which are located in a rural county which is adjacent to one or more urban areas as being urban hospitals for Medicare payment purposes. Revises the method of calculating the wage index for the purpose of adjusting payments after December 1986, to a hospital which has been allowed to continue permitting billing by related organizations. Includes psychologists' services furnished to hospital inpatients as covered inpatient hospital services. Requires Medicare hospitals to place every patient covered under the Medicare program under a physician's care, rather than requiring that every patient be under such care. Directs the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission to conduct a study and report to the Congress by April 1, 1988, regarding possible modifications to the prospective payment system that will provide more adequate and appropriate payments for high cost (outlier) burn cases. Covers 90 percent of the costs by which burn cases exceed the point at which a case is designated as an outlier case. Changes the cost-effectiveness performance period under the hospital demonstration project reimbursement system. Prohibits the Secretary from altering the method for making Medicare payments to hospitals for the unrecovered costs associated with unpaid deductible or coinsurance amounts for inpatient hospital services. Directs the Secretary to include in the annual report to the Congress on the Medicare program a comparison between outlier payments to urban hospitals and outlier payments to rural hospitals. Classifies rural hospitals which have 272 or more beds as rural referral centers. (Currently, a rural hospital having 500 or more beds is designated a rural referral center.) Directs the Secretary to establish a grant program to assist small rural hospitals and their communities to plan and implement projects modifying the type and extent of services such hospitals provide in order to adjust for changes in the need for such services. Prohibits a grant to a hospital from exceeding a two-year term. Sets forth reporting requirements. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1989 and 1990. Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 to delay, from November 21, 1987, to December 31, 1988, the effective date of requirements relating to hospital standards for organ transplants and standards for organ procurement agencies. Amends the Medicare program to alter the formula for determining the amount to be paid to hospitals for their indirect costs of medical education. Directs the Secretary to enter into agreements with four hospitals to conduct three-year demonstration projects whereby such hospitals provide to rural hospitals, for one to three months of training, physicians who have completed one year of residency training. Sets the amount by which a hospital's Medicare prospective payments shall be reduced to account for its capital-related costs at ten percent of prospective payments for cost reporting periods occurring after November 20, 1987, and before the close of FY 1990. Postpones until FY 1990, the Secretary's authority to include capital-related costs in the prospective payment system. Prohibits the Secretary from changing the definition of \"capital-related costs\" or changing the methodology for paying hospitals for such costs prior to FY 1990. Prohibits Medicare periodic interim payments to a hospital serving a disproportionate share of low-income patients on or after July 1, 1990, unless such hospital demonstrates that the discontinuance of such payments would pose an immediate threat to the hospital's ability to operate. Defers periodic interim payments which would otherwise be made to disproportionate share hospitals during at least the last 21 days of FY 1989, until FY 1990. Extends, through FY 1990, the adjustment of Medicare payments made to hospitals which serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. Subparts II: Provisions Affecting Medicare Parts A and B - Amends parts A (Hospital Insurance) and B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of the Social Security Act to require that no Medicare claims be processed within ten days in FY 1988, 11 days in FY 1989, and 12 days in FY 1990. Subjects claims received from comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facilities or rehabilitation agencies to prompt payment standards. Requires the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register, by September 1 before each fiscal year, the data, standards, and methodology to be used to establish budgets for fiscal intermediaries and carriers for that fiscal year. Amends the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 to increase appropriations in FY 1988 for use by fiscal intermediaries and carriers in carrying out provider cost audits and medical necessity reviews. Extends such appropriations through FY 1990, but at a lesser amount. Amends the Medicare program to prohibit the Secretary from assessing the performance of an intermediary or carrier by the sole consideration of the ratio of amounts saved by claim denials to amounts expended on provider review by the intermediary or carrier. Includes government entities within the requirement that large group health plans function as the primary payer for items and services covered under such plans and the Medicare program. Makes primary payer requirements applicable to end-stage renal disease payments. Subpart III: Provisions Affecting Medicare Part B - Amends part B of the Medicare program to increase the medical economic index by the full amount of the percentage increase for primary physicians' services and by one percent for other physicians' services in 1988. Provides incentive payments to physicians who furnish services on an assignment-related basis in a rural area designated as a health manpower shortage area under the Public Health Service Act. Prohibits the Secretary from setting the customary charge for a new physician's services at more than 80 percent of the prevailing charge for a service. Reduces the prevailing charge for cataract extraction with intraocular lens implant, intraocular lens insertion, coronary artery bypass surgery, total hip replacement, suprapubic prostatectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate, diagnostic dilation and curettage, and carpal tunnel release. Limits nonparticipating physicians' actual charges for such procedures if such reductions in prevailing charges result in reductions in the reasonable charges for such procedures. Makes certain changes in the calculation of maximum allowable actual charges for physicians who did not have actual charges for a procedure in the calendar quarter beginning on April 1, 1984, and in the application of such charges to a group practice. Makes the imposition of civil penalties for the improper use of assistants at cataract surgery inapplicable to surgery performed prior to March 1, 1987. Permits a peer review organization (PRO) and the appropriate carrier to approve the use of an assistant at cataract surgery if the use of an assistant is necessary to perform a surgical technique of established economic benefit that eliminates the need for an anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist. Requires the Secretary to establish a separate utilization screen (used by carriers to check for possible overutilization of services) for physician visits to patients in rehabilitation hospitals and units. Directs the Secretary to enter into an agreement with any physician who, by reason of a breach of a contract entered into by such physician pursuant to the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program, owes a past-due obligation to the United States under which deductions are to be made from amounts otherwise payable to the physician under the Medicare and Medicaid (title XIX of the Act) programs until the past-due obligation has been repaid. Sets forth a procedure for collecting such amounts from providers and health maintenance organizations with whom such physicians are employed. Directs the Secretary to report the results of a study by January 1, 1989, of the variations in conversion factors used by Medicare carriers in determining the prevailing charge for anesthesia services. Changes the date, from March 1 to May 1 of each year, by which the Physician Payment Review Commission must make recommendations to the Congress regarding adjustments to physician payment rates and the methodology for determining such rates. Sets a limit, determined pursuant to a specified formula, on the aggregate Medicare payment which may be made in a cost reporting period for the cost of outpatient hospital radiology services. Extends for one year, through 1989, current part B premium provisions. Increases part B coverage of outpatient mental health services, but excludes from such coverage brief office visits for the sole purpose of prescribing or monitoring prescription drugs used in treating mental disorders. Provides part B coverage of partial hospitalization services furnished incident to physicians' services to outpatients. Prohibits regulations providing for payment of a return on equity capital from including provision for specific recognition of any return on equity capital with respect to hospital outpatient departments. Updates the maximum rate of payment per visit for independent rural health clinics. Includes certified nurse-midwife services within covered part B services. Includes the services of clinical psychologists in the definition of covered rural health clinic services if such services would be covered if furnished by a physician or as incident to a physician's services. Provides part B coverage of psychologists' services furnished at community mental health centers pursuant to a fee schedule to be established by the Secretary. Provides part B coverage for therapeutic shoes furnished to individuals with severe diabetic foot disease. Requires that durable medical equipment furnished by a Medicare provider, other than inexpensive equipment or equipment deemed eligible for long-term rental, be purchased on a lump sum or lease-purchase basis. Allows the lump sum purchase of such equipment only where the expected duration of the medical need for such equipment warrants the assumption that a lump sum purchase would be less costly than a lease-purchase. Covers 80 percent of the reasonable charge for durable medical equipment bought on a lump sum basis. Provides coverage for the services of physician assistants in all settings. Sets the allowable charges for such services in different settings. Maintains the current formula for reimbursing hospitals which specialize in eye and ear surgical procedures beyond FY 1988 in the case of hospitals which receive over 50 percent of their revenues from eye and ear outpatient procedures. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress within one year of this Act's enactment on modifying the amount of payments made to hospitals that specialize in specific surgical procedures. Subpart IV: Provisions Affecting PROs - Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress, within one year of this Act's enactment, on improved procedures for imposing sanctions against Medicare (title XVIII of the Social Security Act) providers which furnish items or services which are not medically necessary or do not meet professionally recognized health care standards. Amends part B (Peer Review) of title XI of the Social Security Act to require peer review organizations (PROs) to give providers whose services are denied Medicare coverage an opportunity for discussion and review of the determination before patients and organizations responsible for paying claims are notified of such determination. Amends the Medicare program to require that the Secretary's budget separately state the amount of budget authority for inpatient hospital services and the amount of budget authority for the PRO program. (Currently, PRO costs are included as costs incurred by hospitals in providing inpatient hospital services.) Amends part B of title XI of such Act to require the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register: (1) any new policy or procedure affecting PRO performance of contract obligations within 45 days prior to the effective date of such policy or procedure; and (2) the general criteria and standards used in evaluating PRO performance of contract obligations. Directs the Secretary to: (1) regularly furnish each PRO with a report that documents its performance in relation to other PROs; and (2) negotiate necessary contractual modifications with PROs before requiring them to perform additional functions.

Authorizes the Secretary to establish demonstration projects examining the feasibility of requiring instruction and oversight of rural physicians, in lieu of imposing sanctions, through the use of video communication between rural and teaching hospitals. Permits providers to represent Medicare beneficiaries during appeals of PRO determinations, but prohibits providers from imposing any financial liability on such beneficiaries in connection with such representation. Protects Medicare beneficiaries from liability for services which PROs determine are not covered under the Medicare program. Requires a hospital to notify a patient of its request that a PRO review its determination that such patient no longer requires inpatient hospital care if the attending physician disagrees with the hospital's determination.

Requires that, in addition to the preadmission review of mentally ill or retarded individuals, State mental health authorities conduct an annual review of mentally ill or retarded residents to determine whether such residents require nursing facility services and whether they require active treatment for mental illness or retardation. Directs that such preadmission and annual reviews be conducted in accordance with criteria to be developed by the Secretary by October 1, 1988. Sets forth required nursing facility responses to determinations as to whether such residents need nursing facility services and need, or do not need, active treatment for mental illness or retardation. Gives long-term residents who do not require nursing facility services, but who require active treatment, the choice of remaining in the facility or receiving covered services in an alternative setting. Requires nursing facilities to provide for the active treatment of residents in need of treatment for mental illness or retardation regardless of their continued need for nursing facility services or their discharge from such facility. Requires States to have an appeals process in effect by 1989 for mentally ill or retarded individuals adversely affected by a preadmission or annual review.

Provides that for the initial determination of an institutionalized spouse's Medicaid eligibility all the resources held by either the institutionalized or community spouse shall be considered available to the institutionalized spouse, except for an amount which equals: (1) the community spouse resource allowance determined without subtracting from such allowance resources otherwise available to the community spouse; or (2) the amount a court orders to be retained by the community spouse if such amount exceeds the resource allowance. Sets forth the formula for determining the community spouse resource allowance which provides the community spouse with at least $12,000 annually, with annual adjustments to such formula reflecting changes in the cost-of-living. Excludes from the determination of the institutionalized spouse's eligibility support which the community spouse owes to the institutionalized spouse, if the latter assigns his or her support rights to the State. Provides that after the initial eligibility determination: (1) no resources of the community spouse will be considered available to the institutionalized spouse; and (2) the income of the institutionalized spouse will not be considered to include a personal need allowance set at no less than the benefits available to an institutionalized individual under title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of such Act and a community spouse monthly income allowance determined pursuant to a specified formula. Gives the institutionalized and the community spouse the right to a hearing to establish that the community spouse monthly income allowance or resource allowance is not adequate to support the community spouse without financial duress so that an adequate amount of support will be substituted for the allowance. Prohibits such income allowance from being less than court-ordered support payments.

Requires States making supplementary payments to residents of medical facilities who are receiving SSI benefits to increase and then maintain them at the increased level. Authorizes the Secretary to make an emergency cash advance to presumptively eligible individuals who are initially applying for SSI benefits up to the amount which would be payable for the first month to an eligible individual with no other income. Directs the Secretary, where necessary to avoid undue hardship, to suspend the penalties applied when individuals become SSI eligible by disposing of their resources at less than fair market value. Excludes payments under part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) (AFDC) of title IV of such Act from SSI income eligibility determinations. Excludes from SSI resource eligibility determinations real property which, for specified reasons, cannot be sold. Provides that SSI benefits shall not be reduced to the extent that amounts set aside for burial and related expenses are used for other purposes if the amount used for other purposes would not cause the individual to exceed SSI resource limits. Amends the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 to permanently disregard in-kind assistance provided by nonprofit organizations to SSI or AFDC recipients in determining the need or eligibility of such recipients. Amends the SSI program to exclude death benefits from an individual's income for SSI eligibility purposes to the extent such benefits do not exceed amounts such individual expended on the deceased person's last illness and burial.

Amends the SSI program to prohibit individuals who are in a public emergency shelter for the homeless for more than six months in any nine-month period from being eligible for SSI payments. (Currently, SSI eligibility terminates when an individual has been in such shelter for more than three months in a 12-month period.) Entitles individuals who are applying for or receiving SSI benefits on the basis of blindness to elect to receive supplementary notice by telephone, initial notice by certified mail, or notice by some alternative procedure, of any determination made or other action taken with respect to such individual's SSI rights. Directs the Secretary to study the desirability and feasibility of extending such notices to other individuals who may lack the ability to read. Treats individuals who are ineligible for SSI benefits by reason of their receipt of widow's or widower's insurance benefits under the OASDI program as SSI recipients for purposes of the Medicaid program. Extends until July 1, 1988, the deadline for disabled widows or widowers who become ineligible for SSI benefits by reason of the increase in OASDI benefits caused by the Social Security Amendments of 1983 to apply for Medicaid coverage.
