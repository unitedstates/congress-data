    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "Safe Incinerator Act of 1988 - Amends the Clean Air Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate performance standards to control emissions of particulate matter, acid gases, sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, heavy metals, lead, cadmium, halogenated organic compounds, dioxins, and dibenzofurans from new or modified municipal waste incineration units. Requires that such standards reflect the greatest degree of emission limitation achievable through application of the best available control technologies and practices. Deems specified practices and control technologies to be available. Requires that such standards be promulgated within one year of this Act's enactment, take effect within 18 months of enactment, and be reviewed and, if necessary, revised within three years of promulgation and every five years thereafter. Requires jurisdictions served by the municipal incineration unit to have an enforceable solid waste management plan before a State program may issue a permit for a new or modified unit. Requires such plan to reflect the operation of the new or modified unit. Directs the Administrator to promulgate regulations and emission control standards, within one year of this Act's enactment, requiring existing units to meet such standards according to a timetable which requires compliance within at least six years. Requires the Administrator to review and, if necessary, revise such standards every five years. Establishes specific, minimum emission limitations for carbon monoxide, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and hydrogen chloride emissions from new, modified, and existing units. Requires owners or operators of municipal waste incineration units to monitor emissions at the point such emissions move into the ambient air and at other points as necessary to protect human health and the environment and to report the results of such monitoring. Sets monitoring standards, including continuous and periodic monitoring. Authorizes the Administrator to require unit owners or operators to establish and operate or pay for a program to detect impacts of the unit on humans or the environment, including the testing for and reporting of significant levels of contaminants. Authorizes the Administrator or States to request the Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry to conduct health assessments, studies, or surveillance when exposure to municipal waste incinerator unit emissions may pose a potential health risk. Requires that unit permits be reviewed and, if necessary, revised every five years. Authorizes concurrent State enforcement of unit emission standards, provided such enforcement is equivalent to Federal enforcement under this Act. Directs the Administrator to publish guidelines, within one year of this Act's enactment, identifying items or materials that should be removed from municipal waste prior to incineration. Directs the Administrator to establish a model State program, within 18 months of this Act's enactment, for the training and certification of municipal waste incinerator personnel. Requires operators and management personnel to pass such training or be certified by an authorized State program. Includes as major emitting facilities under the Clean Air Act municipal incinerators capable of charging more than 50 tons of refuse per day. (Currently, only incinerators charging more than 250 tons per day are included.) Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require the Administrator to promulgate regulations, within one year of this Act's enactment, for the safe management of municipal incinerator ash. Requires that landfills into which such ashes are disposed provide for groundwater monitoring and: (1) have two or more liners and a leachate collection system above and between such liners; or (2) place such ashes in a monofill having a single liner and designed to assure that there will be no future migration of any constituent into ground or surface water. Provides that such regulations may permit bottom ash or combined bottom ash and flue which has been treated to be placed in sanitary landfills meeting current criteria. Directs the Administrator, in developing regulations for the management of municipal incinerator ash, to issue criteria and testing procedures for identifying the characteristics of such ash which may pose a hazard to human health or the environment. Authorizes the Administrator to require the owner or operator of a municipal incinerator or any facility involved in ash management to test the ash in accordance with such criteria and testing procedures. Requires that any ash which is identified as posing a hazard to human health or the environment be disposed of in a landfill which has two or more liners and a leachate collection system above and between such liners. Subjects facilities receiving municipal incinerator ash to a permit, or other prior approval program and conditions in accordance with a State's solid waste management program. Provides public notice and the opportunity for an informal public hearing prior to the issuance of a permit to an ash management facility. Authorizes the Administrator to issue a corrective action order or commence a civil action against the offending facility when there has been a release of a hazardous ash constituent."
