    "text": "(Senate agreed to House amendments with an amendment) Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 - Title I: Housing Assistance - Subtitle A: Programs Under United States Housing Act of 1937 - Part I: General Provisions - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to increase FY 1988 and 1989 budget authority for lower income housing programs. Sets forth FY 1988 and 1989 budget amounts for the following programs: (1) public housing, including Indian housing; (2) comprehensive improvement assistance program; (3) elderly and handicapped program; (4) moderate rehabilitation program; (5) loan management program; (6) property disposition program; and (7) section 8 certificate and voucher programs. Permits public housing agencies (PHAs) to establish three-year rent limitations. Exempts housing administered by an Indian PHA from such provision. Directs the Comptroller General to report to the Congress by October 30, 1988, regarding public housing utility allowances. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (Secretary) to establish different income eligibility limitations for different assisted housing programs, provided that such limitations when aggregated achieve the requirement that 95 percent of such housing go to very low-income households. Waives such aggregate percentage: (1) if necessary to avoid rental displacement; and (2) with regard to Indian housing. Part 2: Public Housing - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to authorize PHAs to admit persons between 50 years old and 62 years old (near elderly) into elderly public housing when there is an insufficient number of elderly persons for such units. Authorizes grants for public housing and Indian housing construction and development. Limits, as of October 1, 1987, the financing of new public housing units to PHAs that can certify: (1) that 85 percent of their existing units are maintained in compliance with section 8 quality standards, or will be in such condition upon completion; (2) that the construction will replace disposed of or demolished units, or is required by court order or by the Secretary; and (3) that demands for family housing exceed rental assistance program capacity. Prohibits the Secretary from recapturing public housing reservation funds for 30 months following the date of reservation, due to the failure of a PHA to complete acquisition and begin construction or rehabilitation. Permits a PHA to make site or project changes during such period as long as such changes will not result in fewer units acquired, constructed, or rehabilitated. Extends such period for delays caused by: (1) the Secretary; (2) environmental review; (3) legal action; or (4) factors beyond the PHA's control. Prohibits the Secretary from using as a criterion for distributing public housing development funds an Indian PHA's rent collection improvement, unless it is one of several other selection criteria. Authorizes Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) new construction in the neighborhood where the PHA determines such housing is needed. Authorizes grants for public housing child care. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress within three years of enactment of this Act. Authorizes FY 1988 and 1989 appropriations. Directs the Secretary to provide payments for operating lower income housing projects through a performance funding system that establishes standards for operating costs and income projections. Authorizes FY 1988 and 1989 appropriations. Authorizes grants for comprehensive improvement assistance. Revises the conditions of approval for project demolition applications to include requirements of: (1) one-for-one replacement unless there is no local need for low-income housing; (2) tenant relocation payment; and (3) section 8-based or alternative-based subsidies if other necessary funding is unavailable. Permits public housing residents to form resident management corporations. Requires such corporations to obtain fidelity bonding and insurance and have their records audited annually. Authorizes such projects to receive comprehensive improvement assistance. Provides for: (1) retention of excess revenues; and (2) resident management technical assistance and training.
