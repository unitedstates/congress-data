Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to educational partnerships to pay the Federal share of costs of the model cooperative programs for authorized activities. Includes among such authorized activities: (1) projects which serve educationally disadvantaged and gifted and talented students; (2) projects designed to enrich secondary school students' career awareness; (3) projects for foreign language instruction; (4) special training for staff to facilitate public school/private sector cooperation; (5) academic internship programs; and (6) projects to provide tutoring by private sector personnel. Sets forth application requirements and the Federal share of such activities. Directs the Secretary annually to evaluate grants made under this title. Directs the Secretary to disseminate to State and local educational agencies and other participants in the eligible partnerships any information relating to the activities assisted under this title. Title V: Training Technology Transfer - Training Technology Transfer Act of 1987 - Establishes the Office of Training Technology Transfer in the Department of Education. Provides that the Director of the Office shall be appointed by the Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Secretaries of Commerce and Labor. Sets forth provisions relating to staffing and staff compensation. Requires the Director to compile and maintain a current and comprehensive inventory of all training technology developed by or under the supervision of Federal agencies. Defines \"training technology\" as computer software which is developed by a Federal agency to train its employees and which may be transferred to or converted for use by a commercial user or a public interest user. Includes under such definition software for computer-based instructional systems, interactive video disc systems, microcomputer training devices, audiovisual devices, and programmed learning kits, and associated manuals and devices integrally related to the software program. Requires the Director, in compiling such inventory, to: (1) consult with and fully utilize the resources of all Federal agencies engaged in the collection and dissemination of information concerning training technology; and (2) request the participation and cooperation of entities in the legislative and judicial branches. Requires the Director to disseminate the inventory and its revisions widely and on a regular basis to give all potential users of training technology ample notice of its development by Federal agencies. Requires the Director to use all interagency and intergovernmental communications mechanisms and to encourage the participation of independent private sector organizations. Requires the Director to develop and distribute detailed instructions and procedures for securing copies, and rights thereto, of training technology listed in such inventory and guidelines for cooperative agreements between commercial users and public interest users under specified provisions of this title. Defines \"public interest user\" as: (1) any Federal agency which uses or intends to use the training technology of another Federal agency; and (2) any nonprofit entity which uses or intends to use the training technology of a Federal agency and which provides job training, vocational education, or other education services (including public school systems, vocational schools, private preparatory schools, colleges, universities, community colleges, private industry councils, community-based organizations, and State and local government agencies). Requires the Director to advise and consult with any prospective public interest user of training technology listed in the inventory and assist such user in securing the transfer of such technology from the Federal agency which developed it. Requires the Director to encourage such user to obtain such technology by working with the Training Technology Transfer Officer of such agency. Requires the Director, if an agency has not established procedures for the transfer of training technology, to negotiate the transfer of such technology upon application by such user. Authorizes the Director to enter into contracts with institutions of higher education and qualified private sector business concerns for the conversion of training technology in order to adapt such technology to the requirements of a public interest user. Requires the Director to advise and consult with any prospective commercial user of a training technology listed in the inventory. Authorizes the Director to sell or lease such technology, including exclusive or nonexclusive rights in patents or copyrights, to a commercial user on a cost reimbursable basis. Authorizes the Director to waive, or negotiate reductions of, such purchase prices or other favorable terms for commercial users who agree to enter into cooperative agreements with public interest users or user groups. Requires such agreements to be acceptable to the Director and to provide for a conversion of the training technology, without charge, by the commercial user to meet the specific needs of the public interest user or user group. Requires the Director, in negotiating such terms for the sale or lease of training technology, to give preferential consideration to cooperative agreements which: (1) will result in enhancing the employment potential and potential earnings of the maximum number of individuals; (2) encourage and promote multiple uses of training technology converted by users with similar training needs; and (3) provide beneficial uses of training technology for small businesses. Requires any training technology converted under such a cooperative agreement to be: (1) listed in the inventory; and (2) available for transfer to any other public interest user. Requires the Director to: (1) study the effectiveness of training technology transfers and conversions under this title; and (2) analyze national needs for methods to convert training technology which are in addition to the method of cooperative agreements between commercial and public interest users. Requires the Director, within three years after the enactment of this title, to report to the Congress on such study and analysis, with the Director's recommendations as to whether the public interest would be served through the establishment of a program of grants to support the conversion of training technology. Requires all Federal agencies to cooperate with the Director in implementing this title. Requires Federal agency heads to report to the Secretary of Education if they find that their agency cannot cooperate with the Director for reasons of national security or any other reason. Directs the Secretary to report all such findings received during the preceding 12-month period to the Congress by July 1 of each year. Requires the Director to cooperate with the Federal Software Exchange Center of the National Technical Information Service to facilitate training technology transfer between Federal agencies. Sets forth administrative provisions. Establishes the Training Technology Transfer Advisory Board and sets forth provisions relating to Board appointments, compensation, and meetings. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 and succeeding fiscal years. Title VI: Higher Education - Part A: International Business Education Program - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary to make grants to institutions of higher education to pay the Federal share of the cost of planning, establishing, and operating centers for international business education which: (1) will be national resources for the teaching of improved business techniques, strategies, and methodologies which emphasize the international context in which business is transacted; (2) will provide instruction in critical foreign languages and international fields needed to provide understanding of the cultures and customs of United States trading partners; and (3) will provide research and training in the international aspects of trade, commerce, and other fields of study. Requires such centers to serve as regional resources to businesses proximately located by offering programs and providing research designed to meet the international training needs of such businesses. Describes programs and activities to be conducted by such centers. Requires institutions, or combinations of such institutions, in order to be eligible for assistance, to establish a Center Advisory Council to conduct extensive planning concerning the scope of the center's activities and programs. Establishes the schedule for the Federal share of costs for such centers. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1988 and for each of the three succeeding fiscal years.
