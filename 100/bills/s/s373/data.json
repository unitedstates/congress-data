    "text": "(Measure indefinitely postponed in Senate, H.R. 5 passed in lieu) Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary Education Improvement Act of 1987 - Title I: Basic Programs - Chapter 1: Financial Assistance to Meet Special Educational Needs of Children - Part A: Basic Programs Operated by Local Educational Agencies - Subpart 1: Allocations - Provides for basic grants under Chapter 1. Reserves one percent of Chapter 1 funds for grants to U.S. territories and to the Secretary of the Interior for schools for Indian children run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Sets forth formulas for grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) and to Puerto Rico. Sets forth special allocation procedures. Requires at least ten children in the school district or county for a LEA to qualify for a basic grant. Bases the number of children to be counted for purposes of such basic grants on the number of children aged five to 17, inclusive, in the school district of the LEA who are either: (1) from families below the poverty level; or (2) living in non-Federal institutions for neglected or delinquent children or being supported in foster homes with public funds. Includes within such count for FY 1989 through 1991 the number of children from families above the poverty level which receive aid to families with dependent children (AFDC). Sets forth requirements relating to determination of such numbers. Provides for the basic grant program for Indian children. Directs the Secretary of Interior to use specified funds for payments to LEAs for out-of-State Indian children.
