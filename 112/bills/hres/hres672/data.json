Recognizes that climate change poses unacceptable risks to the health, safety, and welfare of current and future generations of the United States. Accepts responsibility to safeguard the welfare of the people of the United States and acknowledges that such welfare is best protected by policies that: (1) reduce energy consumption and increase energy efficiency; (2) shift power supply strategy from oil, coal, and natural gas to wind, solar, geothermal, and other renewable energy sources to reduce dependence on fossil fuels; (3) capture and store carbon by planting and greening of urban landscapes and improving land and forest management practice; and (4) help people prepare for and withstand the significant impacts of climate change. Pledges that the House of Representatives will promptly introduce and enact legislation to achieve such goals."
