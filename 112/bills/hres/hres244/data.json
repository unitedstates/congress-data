Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that U.S. aid to the Palestinians is intended to: (1) prevent acts of terrorism against Israel, (2) create the stability and prosperity in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip that promotes peaceful coexistence with Israel, and (3) meet humanitarian needs in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip."
