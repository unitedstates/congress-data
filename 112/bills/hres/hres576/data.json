Calls on China to: (1) desist from further executions, ensure that trials are conducted in accordance with international obligations, and allow international observers and the media to attend the trials; (2) provide a list of individuals detained in the aftermath of the July 2009 events in Xinjiang to the International Committee of the Red Cross, and grant access to those individuals for family members and legal counsel; and (3) cease government-sponsored crackdowns in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and refrain from pressuring other governments to return Uyghurs to China. Calls on the President to: (1) state U.S. opposition to the flawed trials, executions, and harsh prison sentences against peaceful Uyghur protestors; and (2) restate the U.S. interest to open consulates in Lhasa, Tibet, and in Urumqi, Xinjiang."
