Affirms that while the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects against arbitrary classifications, and requires that similarly situated persons be treated equally, members of the uniformed services and overseas citizens are not similarly situated, and that the restrictions, uncertainties, and risks that members of the uniformed services face warrant consideration that is not arbitrary."
