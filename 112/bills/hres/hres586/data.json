Declares that the United States should: (1) work with International Monetary Fund (IMF) member states to restrict Argentina's access to IMF benefits until Argentina has complied with its obligations, and (2) oppose further loans to Argentina by the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank and encourage other countries to do the same. Declares that Argentina's behavior is not befitting a member of The Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (G-20) and that the United States should work with other G-20 members to re-evaluate Argentina's G-20 membership."
