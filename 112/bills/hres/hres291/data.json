Calls upon the President to fully implement the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 and begin the U.S. Embassy's relocation in Israel to Jerusalem. Encourages the President to urge other governments to recognize Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state and to recognize Jerusalem as its undivided capital. Urges the Department of State to allocate and expend no funding for the physical plant of the U.S. Embassy in Israel, located in Tel Aviv, as well as the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem, until the Department allocates and expends a proportionate amount of funds for the construction of and other costs related to the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem."
