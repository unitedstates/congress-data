Encourages states to protect minors from efforts that promote or promise to change sexual orientation or gender identity or expression, based on the premise that homosexuality or transgender identity is a mental illness or developmental disorder that can or should be cured. Defines \"sexual orientation and gender identity or expression change efforts\" as any practice by a licensed mental health provider, health care provider, or counselor seeking or purporting to impose change of an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity or expression, including efforts to change such behavioral expression or eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same sex. Excludes culturally competent, affirmative therapy providing: (1) acceptance, support, and understanding of an individual's sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression and the facilitation of an individual's coping, social support, and identity exploration and development, including interventions to prevent or address unlawful conduct or unsafe sexual practices; or (2) acceptance, support, or understanding of an individual's gender expression or the facilitation of an individual's coping, social support, and identity exploration and development."
