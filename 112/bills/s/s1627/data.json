Requires the aggregate number of increases in the otherwise applicable resident limit to be 3,000 in each of FY2013-FY2017, of which 1,500 in each such fiscal year shall be used for full-time equivalent residents training in a shortage speciality residency program. Specifies the process for distributing positions. Directs the National Health Care Workforce Commission to study the physician workforce. Directs the Comptroller General to study strategies for increasing the diversity of the health profession workforce."
