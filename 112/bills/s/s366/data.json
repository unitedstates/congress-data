Specifies the contents of mandatory disclosures. Requires the President to: (1) initiate an investigation into the possible imposition of sanctions when the SEC receives a report that an issuer or its affiliate has engaged in the cited activities; and (2) determine within 180 days of initiating an investigation whether sanctions should be imposed on the issuer or the affiliate concerned. Directs the SEC to make publicly available the information it has received, and to provide it to the President and to certain congressional committees. Requires promulgation within 90 days after enactment of this Act of regulations governing financial institutions maintaining accounts for foreign financial institutions."
