Requires such measures to include methods: (1) by which administrative records of a nongovernmental organization may be used to enumerate organization members residing overseas if such records satisfy the Secretary's criteria, (2) under which an international \"Be Counted\" form may be completed at a U.S. embassy by U.S. citizens residing overseas, and (3) under which voter registration rolls may be used to establish usual residence by confirming the state in which U.S. citizens living abroad usually reside."
