Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to: (1) render a specified expatriate inadmissible to the United States, and (2) prohibit any waiver of such inadmissibility. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security (DHS), to develop a policy for granting a waiver of inadmissibility to a specified expatriate who satisfies a tax liability related to such expatriate's renunciation of of U.S. citizenship."
