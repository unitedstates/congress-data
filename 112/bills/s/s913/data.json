Requires such rules to allow for the collection and use of personal information if: (1) the information is necessary to provide a service requested by the individual so long as identifying particulars are removed or the information is deleted upon the provision of such service; or (2) the individual receives clear, conspicuous, and accurate notice on, and consents to, such collection and use. Provides for FTC and state enforcement of such rules and regulations."
