Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from considering specified alternatives related to private property protections. Requires such study to include an analysis and documentation regarding whether each alternative proposed has potential or actual impact on private property within or adjacent to the trail area. Requires private property owners whose land will be studied to be notified that such study will be conducted."
