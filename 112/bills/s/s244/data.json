Sets forth provisions that may be made inapplicable within a state, including provisions related to health coverage, essential health benefits, health insurance exchanges, alternative health plans established by states, individual and employer health coverage requirements,\u00a0interoperable protocols for enrollment in federal and state health and human service programs, and expansion of Medicaid coverage."
