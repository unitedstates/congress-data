    "text": "Voter Fraud Prevention Act - Amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to prescribe standards for paid distribution of voter registration application forms and registration requirements for organizations. Prohibits any individual from distributing, for compensation, a voter registration application form for federal elections in a state if the individual: (1) has been convicted of a felony under any state or federal law; (2) does not sign and print legibly the individual's name on the form; (3) does not provide identifying information to the proper election official; or (4) does not certify, under penalty of perjury, that he or she has not received financial compensation based on the number of voter registration application forms submitted by the individual to an election official upon completion by the applicant, and that the information provided by the individual is accurate to the best of the individual's knowledge. Excepts from this prohibition the distribution of a voter registration application form by an individual who is not compensated directly or indirectly for it. Establishes criminal penalties for: (1) individuals not meeting such standards; and (2) anyone who employs such an individual knowingly, or who should reasonably be expected to know the individual is ineligible."
