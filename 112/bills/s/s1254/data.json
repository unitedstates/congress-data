    "text": "Department of Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 - Division A: Department of Defense Authorizations - Title I: Procurement - Subtitle A: Authorization of Appropriations - (Sec. 101) Authorizes appropriations for FY2012 for the Department of Defense (DOD) for procurement for the Army, Navy and Marine Corps, Air Force, and defense-wide activities, in amounts specified in a related funding table. Subtitle B: Navy Programs - (Sec. 121) Authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to enter into one or more multiyear contracts, beginning with the FY2012 program year, for the procurement of mission avionics and common cockpits for MH-60R/S helicopters. Subtitle C: Air Force Programs - (Sec. 131) Authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to procure two advanced extremely high frequency satellites through a fixed-price contract. Authorizes such Secretary to (1) include the use of economic order quantities when resulting in cost savings, as well as cost reduction initiatives; and (2) use incremental funding under such contract for up to six fiscal years. Limits total procurement costs to $3.1 billion, allowing a cost adjustment upon notification to the congressional defense and appropriations committees. Directs such Secretary to: (1) report to such committees within 30 days after entering into such a contract, and (2) submit to such committees a plan to use contract cost savings to improve the capability of military satellite communications. Allows such Secretary to use funds currently available for high frequency satellite space vehicle number 5 for the procurement of parts and the replacement of parts for space vehicle number 6. Expresses the sense of Congress that such Secretary should not enter into such a contract until determining that it will save the Air Force 20% or more over procuring two satellites separately. (Sec. 132) Earmarks the use of specified B-2 bomber aircraft funds for: (1) research, development, test, and evaluation on a conventional mixed load capability for such aircraft, and (2) supporting alternative options for the extremely high frequency terminal Increment 1 program of record. Directs the Secretary of the Air Force to submit to the defense and appopriations committees a plan to provide an extremely high frequency terminal for secure protected communications for the B-2 and other aircraft. (Sec. 134) Prohibits this Act's funds from being obligated or expended: (1) to retire any B-1 bomber aircraft before the date on which the Secretary of the Air Force submits to the defense and appropriations committee a plan for retiring such aircraft; and (2) after such date, to retire more than six of such aircraft. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) at least 60% of the savings achieved in each year through 2022 resulting from such retirements should be reinvested in modernizing and sustaining bomber aircraft, and (2) at least 35% of such amount should be reinvested in modernizing and sustaining the remaining B-1 fleet through such period. (Sec. 135) Prohibits the Secretary of the Air Force from taking any action to prevent maintaining the U-2 aircraft fleet in its current configuation and capability beyond FY2016 until the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (Under Secretary) certifies to the defense, appropriations, and intelligence committees that the operating and sustainment costs for the Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle are less than comparable costs for the U-2 on a flight-hour basis. Subtitle D: Joint and Multiservice Matters - (Sec. 151) Amends the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (Skelton Act) to include in quarterly reports on the use of combat mission requirement funds a table setting forth the requirements approved during the fiscal year in which the report is submitted and the two preceding fiscal years, as well as a statement of any unspent funds for such period. (Sec. 152) Directs the Secretary of Defense (Secretary), in entering into a contract for the procurement of the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter aircraft, to ensure that the contract: (1) is a fixed-price contract, and (2) requires the contractor to assume full responsibility for contract costs above the target cost. (Sec. 153) Requires the Under Secretary, at the same time as submission of the FY2013 budget, to report to the defense committees on DOD plans to implement the requirements of the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 within the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft program. (Sec. 154) Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to enter into one or more multiyear contracts, beginning with the FY2012 program year, for the procurement of airframes for UH-60M/HH-50M and MH-60R/MH-60S helicopters. (Sec. 155) Directs the Under Secretary to designate the undersea mobility acquisition program of the U.S. Special Operations Command as a major defense acquisition program (MDAP). (Sec. 156) Requires the Secretary to: (1) develop and carry out a plan for the orderly transfer of the Air Force C-12 Liberty intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft to the Army; and (2) report to the defense, appropriations, and intelligence committees on such plan. (Sec. 157) Directs the Air Force Audit Agency to submit to the defense and appropriations committees the results of a financial audit of funds previously authorized and appropriated for the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System aircraft re-engining program. Title II: Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation - Subtitle A: Authorization of Appropriations - (Sec. 201) Authorizes appropriations for FY2012 for DOD for research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E), in amounts specified in the funding table. Subtitle B: Program Requirements, Restrictions, and Limitations - (Sec. 211) Prohibits: (1) the use of this Act's funds for RDT&E on the F136 engine; or (2) such RDT&E conducted by a contractor from being considered an allowable charge on any future government contract. (Sec. 212) Prohibits the obligation or expenditure of funds earmarked for Increment 2 of the B-2 bomber aircraft extremely high frequency satellite communications program until the Secretary of the Air Force submits to the defense and appropriations committees a program certification and a plan setting forth the projected cost and schedule for certain RDT&E under the program. (Sec. 213) Limits to 50% the obligation or expenditure of funds for the unmanned carrier launched airborne surveillance and strike program until the Under Secretary certifies to the defense and appropriations committees the approval of an acquisition plan for such program. (Sec. 214) Prohibits the granting of Milestone B approval for the Marine personnel carrier until 30 days after submission to the defense and appropriations committees of an analysis of alternatives for the amphibious combat vehicle.

Subtitle C: Missile Defense Matters - (Sec. 231) Amends the Skelton Act to direct the Comptroller General (CG), at the end of each of FY2012-FY2015, to review required annual DOD reports on acquisition baselines and variances of missile defense acquisition programs and assess the extent to which the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has achieved its acquisition goals and objectives, and report assessment results to the defense and appropriations committees. (Sec. 232) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) it is essential for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GBMD) element of the Ballistic Missile Defense System to achieve appropriate levels of reliability, availability, sustainability, and operational performance against limited future missile attacks from nations such as North Korea and Iran; (2) the MDA should, as its highest priority, determine the root cause of the December 2010 flight-test failure of the GBMD system, design a correction of the problem, and verify that such correction is effective and will allow the GBMD to reach the capabilities described above; (3) before such verification, the MDA should suspend further production of Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicles to ensure that they will not be deployed with any component or design flaws that may have caused the flight-test failure; (4) after the MDA has verified the correction of the problem, it should assess the need for any additional ground-based interceptors and any additional steps needed for the GBMD testing and sustainment program; and (5) DOD should plan for and budget sufficient future funds for the GBMD to ensure the ability to complete and verify an effective correction of the problem. Requires two annual reports from the Secretary to the defense and appropriations committees on DOD plans to correct the problem, and progress toward achievement of such plan. (Sec. 233) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) it is in the U.S. national security interest to pursue efforts at missile defense cooperation with Russia that would enhance the security of the United States, its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies, and Russia, particularly against missile threats from Iran; (2) the United States should pursue ballistic missile defense cooperation with Russia on both a bilateral and a multilateral basis with its NATO allies, particularly through the NATO-Russia Council; (3) missile defense cooperation with Russia should not in any way limit U.S. or NATO missile defense capabilities and should be mutually beneficial and reciprocal in nature; and (4) the United States should pursue appropriate missile defense cooperation with Russia. Requires a report from the President to the defense, appropriations, and foreign relations committees on the status of efforts to reach agreement with Russia on missile defense cooperation. Subtitle D: Reports - (Sec. 251) Amends the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (Warner Act) to extend through 2020 requirements for a biennial roadmap and annual review and certification of funding for the development of hypersonics.

Provides for the resolution of certain disputes in connection with such claims. (Sec. 315) Amends the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships to provide an exclusion from such Act's ship pollutant discharge requirements for military ships that have unique military design, construction, manning, or operation requirements and cannot comply with such requirements because it is not technologically feasible or would impair the operations or operational capability of the ship. Provides updated pollution discharge requirements for military vessels at sea.
