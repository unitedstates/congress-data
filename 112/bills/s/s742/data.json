Makes a Member serving on or after the enactment of this Act ineligible for a CSRS or FERS deferred retirement annuity, unless the Member is separated from the service, or transferred to a position in which the individual does not continue subject to CSRS or FERS annuity requirements, after completing five years of service. Denies an early retirement annuity under FERS to any Member serving on or after enactment of this Act who otherwise meets FERS early retirement requirements. Delays entitlement to a FERS annuity until after attaining retirement age under the Social Security Act."
