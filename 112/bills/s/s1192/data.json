Provides that after the Office of Tribal Justice certifies that a tribe has completed its planning phase the tribe shall exercise jurisdiction, concurrent with the civil jurisdiction of Alaska, over: (1) drug, alcohol, or related matters within the tribe's project area; and (2) persons of Indian or Alaska Native descent or other persons with consensual relationships with the Indian tribe or a member of the Indian tribe. Permits a participating tribe to impose specified sanctions. Requires the Office of Justice Services of the Department of the Interior to carry out a contract program for the employment by Indian tribes of Village Peace Officers in Alaska Native villages. Authorizes Alaska, its political subdivisions, Indian tribes in Alaska, and the federal government to enter into intergovernmental agreements, including agreements concerning: (1) the employment of law enforcement officers, probation, and parole officers; (2) the cross-appointment and cross-deputization of tribal, state, municipal, or federal officials; (3) the detention or incarceration of offenders; and (4) jurisdictional or financial matters."
