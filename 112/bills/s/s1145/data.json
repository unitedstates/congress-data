Sets forth the crimes under federal law that are covered by this Act, including: (1) arson, (2) bribery of public officials and witnesses, (3) use of a firearm in a violent or drug trafficking crime, (4) genocide, (5) murder, (6) kidnapping, (7) money laundering, (8) robbery or burglary, (9) sexual abuse, and (10) import or export of a controlled substance. Provides for an optional venue for offenses under this Act involving overseas\u00a0federal employees and contractors in the district in which is headquartered the U.S. agency that: (1) employs the offender, or any one of two or more joint offenders; or (2) the offender is accompanying, or that any one of two or more joint offenders is accompanying. Suspends the running of the statute of limitations for any criminal offense involving a federal employee or contractor while the offender is outside the United States or is a fugitive from justice. (Sec. 3) Directs the Attorney General to: (1) assign personnel and resources through task forces to investigate allegations of criminal offenses by federal contractors and employees, and (2) report annually on the number of prosecutions and actions taken. Grants the Attorney General principal authority for the enforcement of this Act. (Sec. 4) Makes this Act effective immediately upon the enactment date but gives the Attorney General and the head of any other federal agency to which this Act applies 90 days after that date to ensure compliance with its provisions. (Sec. 5) Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit or affect: (1) the application of extraterritorial jurisdiction related to any other federal law, or (2) any authority or responsibility of a Chief of Mission as provided in the Foreign Service Act of 1980. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to: (1) apply to authorized intelligence activities that are carried out by an employee of, or by another person on behalf of, any element of the intelligence community, and authorized in a manner consistent with applicable U.S. law; or (2) provide immunity or an affirmative defense to an individual employed by or working on behalf of an element of the intelligence community for actions that are not an authorized intelligence activity. (Sec. 6) Requires any amounts appropriated to carry out this Act to be from amounts which would otherwise have been available or appropriated to the Department of Justice (DOJ)."
