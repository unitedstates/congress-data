    "text": "Early Intervention for Graduation Success Authorization Act of 2011 - Amends the School Dropout Prevention program under part H of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Replaces the existing grant program with a program awarding competitive, renewable, five-year early intervention grants to states and, through them, subgrants to partnerships between local educational agencies (LEAs) and early childhood education providers that serve a high percentage of students who bear the risk factors for dropping out of school. Requires state grantees to: (1) create and periodically update a research-based Statewide Graduation Success Plan addressing the factors associated with the risk of not graduating from high school; (2) provide technical assistance to subgrantees; and (3) implement a Statewide Dropout Early Warning System to identify and direct effective services to children, from birth through elementary school, who are at risk of not graduating from high school. Permits states to use grant funds to: (1) provide tuition assistance to students who agree to teach in an early childhood education program, (2) increase and monitor the quality of early childhood education, (3) design and implement a progression of aligned performance standards across all domains of learning from prekindergarten through postsecondary education, and (4) expand access to high-quality early childhood education for children most at risk of low proficiency in school. Requires subgrantees to: (1) use the Statewide Dropout Early Warning System to implement research-based, individualized interventions for at-risk students; (2) develop and implement individual learning plans for each at-risk early childhood or elementary school student; (3) provide teacher training; (4) integrate community and family support services; and (5) foster students' high expectations and improve their chances for academic success. Reauthorizes the program through FY2017."
