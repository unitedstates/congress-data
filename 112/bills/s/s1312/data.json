    "text": "Asset Forfeiture Responsibility Act of 2011 - Establishes the Fisheries Investment Fund as a separate account in the general fund of the Treasury where all sums received by the United States as fines, penalties, and forfeitures of property for violations of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act) or any other marine resource law enforced by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) shall be deposited and remain available until expended. Directs that fees deposited in the Fund be used to: (1) reimburse reasonable attorneys' fees to a person that the Secretary has directed to be remitted a fisheries enforcement penalty as recommended in the report of Special Master Swartwood or a person that submitted a complaint to the Special Master prior to May 7, 2011, seeking remittance of a fisheries enforcement penalty and whom the Secretary directs to receive at least a portion of such remittance; and (2) conduct Fund audits and specified enforcement and monitoring activities under provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act amended by this Act. Authorizes the Secretary, during FY2012-FY2013, to reimburse reasonable attorneys' fees to such a person. Directs a person to apply for such reimbursement within 60 days after the Secretary directs a fisheries enforcement penalty be remitted to that person. Allows the Secretary to pay from sums appropriated from the Fund for monitoring activities selected by the Regional Fishery Management Councils, including at-sea observers and shoreside monitoring, preparing fishery impact statements, and other priorities established by a Council as necessary to rebuild or maintain sustainable fisheries, ensure healthy ecosystems, and maintain fishing communities. Removes a provision allowing expenses directly related to investigations and civil or criminal enforcement proceedings, including related expenses necessary for equipment, training, travel, witnesses, and contracting services, to be paid from sums received as fines, penalties, and forfeitures of property for violations of the Magnuson-Stevens Act or any other fishery resource law enforced by the Secretary. Authorizes certain other costs and enforcement expenses to be paid from sums appropriated from the Fund."
