Eliminates the positions of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information and for Public Affairs. Eliminates the requirement of Senate approval of all appointments to and promotions for the Commissioned Officer Corps in the Public Health Service and in NOAA. Provides that removal of the requirement of Senate confirmation of any position in this Act shall not result in any such position being placed in the Senior Executive Service or alter compensation for such position. Sec. 3) Expands the requirements for the appointment of a Director of the Census, including that such appointment be made without regard to political affiliation and that the appointee have a demonstrated ability in managing large organizations and experience in the collection, analysis, and use of statistical data. Limits the Director's term to five years, beginning on December 1, 2012, and prohibits a Director from serving more than two full terms. Authorizes the President to remove the Director from office after communicating in writing the reasons for removal to Congress not later than 60 days before the removal. (Sec. 4) Establishes the Working Group on Streamlining Paperwork for Executive Nominations (Working Group) to study and report to the President and specified congressional committees on the streamlining of paperwork required for executive nominations and review the impact of background investigations requirements on the appointments process. Requires that the report of the Working Group include: (1) recommendations for the streamlining of paperwork required for executive nominations, and (2) a detailed plan for the creation and implementation of an electronic system for collecting and distributing background information from nominees for positions which require Senate approval. Requires such electronic system to provide for less of a burden on potential nominees for positions which require Senate approval, faster delivery of background information, fewer errors of omission, and a single, searchable form (Smart Form) that will be free to a nominee, will be easy to use, and will streamline the process of vetting a nominee and tracking information provided by a nominee. (Sec. 5) Requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study and report to Congress and the President on presidentially-appointed positions that do not require Senate approval. (Sec. 6) Makes the provisions of this Act relating to Senate approval of presidential appointments effective 60 days after enactment and makes the other provisions effective upon enactment."
