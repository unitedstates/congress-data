    "text": "Nuclear Fuel Storage Improvement Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to offer to enter into temporary used fuel storage facility agreements in accordance with this Act. Sets a deadline by which a local governmental unit may, with the approval of the state governor, notify the Secretary that it is willing to have a privately owned and operated temporary used fuel storage facility located within its jurisdiction. Requires the Secretary to pay $1 million per year to up to three such governmental units. Makes funding available from the Nuclear Waste Fund for compensation and payments. Directs the Secretary to offer to enter into a long-term contract for the storage of used fuel from civilian nuclear power plants with a private owner or operator of an independent used fuel storage facility licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Authorizes the Secretary, upon request of a contract signatory, to enter into an agreement for a settlement of all claims against the Secretary for failure to dispose of high-level radioactive waste or used nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998. Directs the Secretary to grant priority for the acceptance of fuel produced by a facility that has produced used nuclear fuel, been decommissioned, and shut down permanently. Requires the Secretary to: (1) provide for the transportation of accepted used fuel, and (2) use NRC-approved transportation and storage casks."
