Prohibits filling specified bankruptcy judge vacancies in such districts occurring more than five years after enactment of this Act and resulting from the death, retirement, resignation, or removal of a bankruptcy judge (thus extending the lapse date under current law by five years). Increases by a specified amount the bankruptcy filing fee for a case commenced under chapter 11 (Reorganization) that does not concern a railroad. Requires that incremental amounts collected by reason of such increased fees be: (1) deposited in a special fund in the Treasury; and (2) made available to offset funds appropriated for the operation and maintenance of U.S. courts, but only to the extent specifically appropriated by an Act enacted after enactment of this Act."
