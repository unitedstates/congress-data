    "text": "Medicaid Improvement and State Empowerment Act - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to add a new part B (Taxpayer Provided Pass-Through Funding of Health Care Grants to States for Pregnant Women, Low-Income Children, and Low-Income Families and for Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Low-Income Elderly or Disabled Individuals). Entitles each state that has submitted a plan for each 12-month period to receive a health grant from the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide: (1) medical assistance to pregnant women, low-income children, and low-income families with children whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of medical, rehabilitation, and other services necessary to help them attain or retain capability for independence or self-care; and (2) long-term care services and supports for low-income elderly or disabled individuals with insufficient income and resources to meet the costs of services to help them attain or retain such capability. Directs the Secretary to award grants to assist eligible states in implementing state-based medical malpractice reforms. Terminates funding under SSA titles XIX and XXI (State Children's Health Insurance) (CHIP). Repeals the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the health care-related provisions in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Restores or revives the provisions of law amended or repealed by such Acts as if they had not been enacted. Directs the Secretary to establish a new formula for payments made to or received from states under parts D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) and E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of SSA title IV that are based on the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) applicable to the state under Medicaid."
