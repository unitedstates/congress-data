(Sec. 104) Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Safe Streets Act) to: (1) entitle a state, local, or tribal government to rape exam payments only if such government incurs the full out-of-pocket cost of such exams (current law) and coordinates with regional health care providers to notify sexual assault victims of the availability of free rape exams; and (2) repeal provisions providing that such a government shall be deemed to incur the full out-of-pocket cost of such exams if it reimburses victims for the cost of such exams. Provides that, to be in compliance with rape exam payment requirements, such a government must comply with Act requirements regardless of whether the victim participates in the criminal justice system or cooperates with law enforcement. (Sec. 105) Amends the Justice for All Act of 2004 to authorize appropriations through FY2017 for: (1) DNA training and education for law enforcement, correctional personnel, and court officers; (2) sexual assault forensic exam program grants; (3) DNA research and development; (4) DNA programs of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); and (5) DNA identification of missing persons.

Requires the publication of the best practices within a year. States that nothing in this section shall be construed to require or obligate compliance with the best practices. (Sec. 111) Effective Administration of Criminal Justice Act of 2012 - Amends the Safe Streets Act to require grant applications under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program to include a comprehensive statewide plan for the improvement of the administration of the criminal justice system.

Authorizes appropriations for FY2013-FY2017. (Sec. 112) Subjects all grants awarded by DOJ under this Act to the following: (1) a requirement that the DOJ Inspector General, beginning in FY2013, conduct audits of grant recipients to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse; (2) a requirement that a recipient found to have an unresolved audit finding that the grantee has utilized grant funds for an unauthorized expenditure or otherwise unallowable cost shall be ineligible to receive grant funds for a specified period; (3) a requirement that the Attorney General give priority to eligible entities that, during the three fiscal years before submitting a grant application, did not have an unresolved audit finding showing a violation in the terms or conditions of a DOJ grant program; and (4) requirements that an entity awarded grant funds during the period in which the entity is barred from receiving grants shall deposit an amount equal to the improperly awarded funds into the Treasury's General Fund and that the Attorney General shall seek to recoup the costs of repayment.

Requires the Attorney General to make the information disclosed available for public inspection upon request. Prohibits more than 7.5% of the amounts authorized to be appropriated under this Act from being used by the Attorney General for salaries and administrative expenses of DOJ, unless otherwise explicitly provided in authorizing legislation. Prohibits sums authorized to be appropriated to DOJ under this Act from being used by the Attorney General, or by any individual or organization awarded discretionary funds through a cooperative agreement under this Act, to host or support any expenditure for conferences that uses more than $20,000 in DOJ funds, without prior written authorization by the Deputy Attorney General or other specified officials. Requires: (1) written approval to include a written estimate of all costs associated with the conference, and (2) the Deputy Attorney General to report annually to specified congressional committees on all approved conference expenditures.

Title II: Katie Sepich Enhanced DNA Collection Act of 2012 - Katie Sepich Enhanced DNA Collection Act of 2012 - (Sec. 203) Directs the Attorney General to carry out a grant program for the purpose of assisting states with the costs associated with the implementation of minimum or enhanced DNA collection processes. Defines: (1) \"minimum DNA collection process\" to mean, with respect to a state, a process under which the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) of the FBI is searched at least one time against samples from individuals at least 18 years of age who are arrested for or charged with a criminal offense under state law that consists of murder or voluntary manslaughter, that involves a sexual act or sexual contact with another and that is punishable by imprisonment for more than 5 years, or that involves kidnapping or abduction and that is punishable by imprisonment for more than 5 years; and (2) \"enhanced DNA collection process\" to mean, with respect to a state, a process under which the state provides for the collection, for purposes of inclusion in CODIS, of DNA samples from individuals at least 18 years of age who are arrested for or charged with a criminal offense under state law that consists of murder or voluntary manslaughter, that involves a sexual act or sexual contact with another and that is punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year, that involves kidnapping or abduction and that is punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year, that consists of burglary punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year, or that consists of assault punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year. Sets forth grant application requirements, including requiring a state, to be eligible, to demonstrate that it has statutory authorization for the implementation of either a minimum or enhanced DNA collection process.

Provides that the Attorney General shall retain discretion to determine the amount of each grant awarded to an eligible state, subject to the following: (1) a state seeking a grant with respect to the implementation of a minimum DNA collection process shall be eligible for a grant that is equal to no more than 50% of the first year costs to the state of implementing such process, and (2) a state seeking a grant for implementation of an enhanced DNA collection process shall be eligible for a grant that is equal to no more than 100% of the first year costs. Requires a state, as a condition of receiving a grant, to have a procedure in place to: (1) provide written notification of expungement provisions and instructions for requesting expungement to all persons who submit a DNA sample for inclusion in the index, (2) provide the eligibility criteria for expungement and instructions for requesting expungement on an appropriate public website, and (3) make a determination and provide a written response on all expungement requests within 90 days of receipt. (Sec. 204) Makes the expungement requirements of the DNA Identification Act of 1994 applicable to any samples collected under this title for purposes of inclusion in CODIS. (Sec. 205) Authorizes appropriations to carry out this title for each of FY2013-FY2015, to be derived from sums appropriated under the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000.
