Requires a basis adjustment for mortality, expense, or other reasonable charges incurred under an annuity or life insurance contract. Exempts from rules limiting the exclusion from gross income of life insurance death benefit\u00a0amounts any amounts realized from the\u00a0transfer of a life insurance contract, or any interest therein, that is a reportable policy sale.\u00a0 Defines \"reportable policy sale\" as the acquisition of an interest in a life insurance contract, directly or indirectly, if the acquirer has no substantial family, business, or financial relationship with the insured apart from the acquirer's interest in such life insurance contract."
