    "text": "Community Integrated Nursing Care Homes Demonstration Program Act or the CINCH Demonstration Program Act - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish the CINCH demonstration program to test the viability of multiple small-house nursing care homes that are embedded within residential neighborhoods and collectively certified to provide services through a single eligible operating entity in order to reduce administrative costs and provide cost savings to Medicare and Medicaid programs. Sets forth requirements a small-house nursing care home must meet to be eligible to participate, including requirements to: (1) be certified by a government entity to operate a nursing home; (2) operate in compliance with any direct care and certified nurse assistant staffing requirements under federal, state, and local law; (3) provide nursing home services that shall not be less comprehensive or high-acuity than services provided by the eligible operating entity within the immediate surrounding community; (4) provide for meals cooked in the nursing home; (5) meet specified staffing, care, service, and training levels; and (6) consist of a specified physical environment that is designed to look and feel like a home, rather than an institution. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct the program for a five-year period; (2) select up to six sites to participate, each to be operated by a different entity, with not less than two sites located in rural areas; (3) develop a process to allow a site, after the demonstration program, to continue operation through a single entity and to receive certification as a single provider for purposes of Medicare and Medicaid; and (4) select a technical assistance provider responsible for selecting, assisting, and evaluating the performance of eligible operating entities and ensuring that small-house nursing care homes satisfy this Act's requirements."
