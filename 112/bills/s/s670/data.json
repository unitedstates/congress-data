Amends the Clean Air Act to allow states or political subdivisions to adopt and enforce standards for the control of emissions from new motor vehicles that are taxicabs and other vehicles if such standards will be at least as protective of public health and welfare as applicable federal standards and if such vehicles meet the other criteria specified above."
