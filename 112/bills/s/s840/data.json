    "text": "Stop Canadian Trash Act - Amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to require the Secretary of the Treasury to charge and collect a $500 fee for the provision of customs services for the arrival of a truck that\u00a0is transporting foreign municipal solid waste. Defines \"municipal solid waste\" to mean waste materials discarded for disposal by households or that were generated by commercial, institutional, municipal, or industrial sources, excluding certain hazardous waste, separated recyclable materials, waste being used solely as feedstock for alternative energy production, segregated medical waste, and solid waste generated incident to the provision of service in interstate, intrastate, foreign, or overseas air transportation. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to require each importer of foreign municipal solid waste to provide, with respect to each truck carrying such waste into U.S. customs territory, the cubic feet, specific type, and content of such waste. Establishes a civil penalty for each failure to provide or falsification of information required by this Act."
