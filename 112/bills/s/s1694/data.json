    "text": "Defense Cost-Type Contracting Reform Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of Defense to modify Department of Defense (DOD) acquisition regulations to prohibit the DOD from entering into cost-type contracts for the production of certain major defense acquisition programs (MDAPs). Amends the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 to expand the conditions required to be met before the Milestone Decision Authority may authorize a cost-type contract for development of certain MDAPs. Requires such conditions to include additional written determinations that: (1) all reasonable efforts have been made to define the requirements sufficiently to allow for the use of a fixed-price contract for such development; and (2) the DOD, despite these efforts, cannot define requirements sufficiently to allow for the use of such a fixed-price contract. Requires the Secretary, at least 30 days before issuing a solicitation for the development of an MDAP, to submit to Congress a notice of the proposed award including the written determinations required under such Act and the reasons supporting the determinations."
