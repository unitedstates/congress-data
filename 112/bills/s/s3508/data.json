Requires the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to ensure that SCORE volunteers are adequately oriented and trained in areas and disciplines necessary to ensure successful, outcome-oriented interactions relating to services provided by the SCORE program. Directs the Administrator to ensure that the SCORE program and each SCORE chapter develop and implement plans and goals: (1) for outreach to individuals in rural, ethnically diverse, minority, and underserved communities; and (2) to more effectively and efficiently provide services to individuals in such communities. Requires the SCORE Association to report annually to the Administrator on SCORE counseling and training, as well as on the number of small businesses created or expanded with SCORE assistance. Outlines privacy requirements of the Administrator and the SCORE Association with respect to the disclosure of information concerning businesses assisted under the SCORE program."
