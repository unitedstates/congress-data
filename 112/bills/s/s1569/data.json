    "text": "Empowering Local Educational Decisionmaking Act of 2011 - Replaces title II (Preparing, Training, and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) with a new title II (Fund for the Improvement of Teaching and Learning) program. Moves teacher liability and internet safety provisions to title IX (General Provisions) of the ESEA. Allocates grants to states and, through them, subgrants to local educational agencies (LEAs) pursuant to a formula that apportions: (1) 20% of the funding to states and LEAs on the basis of their share of students aged 5-17 on the national and state level, respectively; and (2) 80% of such funding on the basis of their share of impoverished students in that age group. Requires states to use 95% of those funds for subgrants to LEAs, with the remainder being used for specified state activities. Lists the projects which the subgrants may fund, including: (1) teacher and principal evaluation systems that are based in significant part on student achievement and growth; (2) teacher and principal recruitment, training, and retention efforts; (3) model instructional programs in the core academic subjects; and (4) measures that improve students' access to school library materials, postsecondary level coursework, and extended learning opportunities. Requires those projects to meet certain principles of effectiveness and undergo a periodic evaluation to assess their progress in providing students with a high-quality education taught by effective teachers. Directs the Secretary of Education to: (1) provide technical assistance to grantees and subgrantees, (2) evaluate title II activities, and (3) award competitive grants to national nonprofit organizations for teacher training programs. Replaces title IV (21st Century Schools) of the ESEA with a new title IV (Safe and Healthy Students) program. Moves the gun-free schools requirement and part C (Environmental Tobacco Smoke) of title IV to title IX (General Provisions) of the ESEA. Allots grants to states and, through them, subgrants to LEAs in amounts that reflect their share of impoverished children aged 5-17 on the national and state level, respectively. Requires states to use 98% of those funds for subgrants to LEAs. Requires the subgrants to be used to develop, implement, and evaluate comprehensive programs and activities that: (1) improve students' physical and mental health, diet, and physical fitness; (2) prevent and reduce substance abuse, school violence, and bullying; and (3) strengthen parent and community involvement in these efforts. Requires those programs and activities to meet certain principles of effectiveness and undergo a periodic evaluation to assess their progress in improving students' safety, health, and fitness. Amends title VI (Flexibility and Accountability) of the ESEA to allow LEAs to transfer up to 100% of their allocations under titles II and IV between the two programs or into the school improvement program under part A of title I. Allows states to do the same with the amounts allotted to them under such programs for nonadministrative state level activities. Amends title IX of the ESEA to establish an approval and disapproval process for state and LEA applications under titles II and IV. Repeals: (1) parts B (Student Reading Skills Improvement Grants), F (Comprehensive School Reform), and G (Advanced Placement Programs), and the Close Up Fellowship program under title I of the ESEA; and (2) parts A (Innovative Programs) and D (Fund for the Improvement of Education) under title V of the ESEA."
