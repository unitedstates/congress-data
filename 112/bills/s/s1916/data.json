Defines \"ecosystem component stock\" as a stock of fish determined by the Secretary to be a nontarget stock that is not subject to overfishing or overfished. Requires that ecosystem component species as determined by the Secretary prior to enactment of this Act be determined to be such ecosystem component stocks after enactment of this Act."
