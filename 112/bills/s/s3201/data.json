    "text": "Graduate Medical Education Reform Act of 2012 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish and implement procedures under which, beginning in FY2017, the amount of payments that a hospital would otherwise receive for indirect graduate medical education (GME) costs for discharges during a fiscal year is adjusted based on the hospital's performance on measures of patient care priorities. Requires the Secretary to specify measures of patient care priorities, including the extent of training provided in: (1) the delivery of services categorized as evaluation and management codes by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, (2) a variety of settings and systems, (3) the coordination of patient care across settings, (4) the relevant cost and value of various diagnostic and treatment options, (5) interprofessionality and multidisciplinary care teams, (6) methods for identifying system errors and implementing system solutions, and (7) the use of health information technology. Requires such measures of patient care to be: (1) adopted or endorsed by an accrediting organization, and (2) consensus-based. Allows such measures to include any submitted by teaching hospitals, medical schools, and other stakeholders. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress and the National Health Care Workforce Commission on the GME payments hospitals receive under Medicare."
