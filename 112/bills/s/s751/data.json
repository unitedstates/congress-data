Requires the Secretary to: (1) develop and submit to Congress a comprehensive national manufacturing strategy; (2) establish and submit to Congress targets for the growth of U.S. manufacturing for each of FY2012-FY2016; (3) survey all federal agencies that provide support to U.S. manufacturers, and report survey results to Congress; (4) report to Congress on progress and trends in U.S. manufacturing since a specified 2004 report by the Secretary concerning manufacturing in America; and (5) biennially survey U.S. entities that maintain manufacturing facilities outside the United States, maintain a database on information collected through each survey, and submit each survey's results to Congress."
