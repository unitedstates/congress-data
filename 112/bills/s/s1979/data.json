Includes in the priority worker preference allocation for employment-based immigrants alien physicians who have completed service requirements of a state waiver or exemption, plus an additional two years at the waiver-identified location or in a health care shortage area (including alien physicians who completed such service prior to enactment of this Act). Exempts H-1B nonimmigrant aliens seeking to enter the United States to pursue graduate medical education or training from specified entry limitations (including permitting extension of the six-year authorized period of admission under specified circumstances). Increases the number of alien physicians that a state may be allocated from 30 to 35 per fiscal year under specified circumstances. Permits an alien physician, after fulfilling a three-year service period with a health care employer, to apply for employment with a new health care employer in a health care shortage area."
