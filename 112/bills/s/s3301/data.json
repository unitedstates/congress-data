Requires only that the recipient organization has raised funds from private sources. Extends from two years to three years and nine months the period of time that any surcharge proceeds from the sale of Abraham Lincoln commemorative coins may remain unpaid to the designated recipient organization, solely by reason of the matching fund requirement, before they must be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. (Sec. 624) Prohibits the use of a grant or contract funded by amounts made available under this Act to defray the cost of a conference that is not directly and programmatically related to the purpose of the program under which the grant or contract was awarded.

Prohibits an agency from sponsoring or hosting a conference for which the cost to the agency, using amounts made available under this Act, is expected to be more than $500,000, unless, because of exceptional circumstances, spending more than $500,000 on a conference is the most cost-effective means of achieving a compelling purpose. Requires an agency Office of the Inspector General (OIG) to discharge the authorities and responsibilities of the agency head and Deputy Secretary for any conference sponsored or hosted by the agency IOG. Requires by October 31, 2013, a publicly available report from each agency receiving funds under this Act that sponsors or hosts a conference during FY2013 whose cost to the agency is more than $100,000. Title VII: General Provisions Government-Wide - Sets forth requirements for the use of appropriations by designated departments, agencies, and corporations. (Sec. 701) Sets restrictions upon the use of appropriations by any federal department, agency, or instrumentality unless it has in place, and will continue to administer in good faith, a written policy designed to ensure that all workplaces are free from the illegal use, possession, or distribution of controlled substances by the officers and employees of such department, agency, or instrumentality. (Sec. 726) Prohibits the use of funds by federal agencies, directly or through third parties, except in specified circumstances, to collect, review, create or contract for any aggregation of data by any means of any personally identifiable information relating to an individual's access to or use of any federal government or nongovernmental Internet site. (Sec. 727) Prohibits the use of funds to enter into or renew a contract for a federal employee health plan which includes a provision providing prescription drug coverage, except where the contract also includes a provision for contraceptive coverage. Exempts specified religious plans from such prohibition. Prohibits a federal employee health plan, however, from discriminating against an individual on the basis that the individual refuses to prescribe or otherwise provide for contraceptives because such activities would be contrary to his or her religious beliefs or moral convictions. (Sec. 728) Declares that the United States is committed to ensuring the health of its Olympic, Pan American, and Paralympic athletes, and supports strict adherence to anti-doping in sport through testing, adjudication, education, and research as performed by nationally recognized oversight authorities.
