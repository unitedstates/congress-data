Prohibits gaming on such lands, with specified exceptions, unless the Secretary of the Interior determines that the land is eligible for gaming and the tribe demonstrates: (1) a substantial, direct, modern connection to the land as of October 17, 1988; and (2) a substantial, direct, aboriginal connection to the land. (The Secretary and the state in which the gaming is proposed can still allow gaming on lands acquired for a tribe after October 17, 1988, if they concur that it is in the best interest of the tribe and its members.)"
