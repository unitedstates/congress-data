Reduces the tax rate on the first $5 million of\u00a0net earning of a self-employed taxpayer. Allows nongovernmental employers a tax credit for payroll increases in the last quarter of 2011 and in 2012. Appropriates funds to the social security trust funds to compensate for any revenue loss to such funds from the reduction in rates and the tax credit\u00a0allowed\u00a0by this Act. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose on individual taxpayers in taxable years beginning after 2012 an additional tax equal to 3.25% of so much of their modified adjusted gross income as exceeds $1 million.\u00a0 Defines \"modified adjusted gross income\" as adjusted gross income reduced by any deduction allowed for investment interest.\u00a0 Provides for an inflation adjustment to the $1 million threshold amount for taxable years beginning after 2013."
