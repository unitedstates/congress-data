Allows such data collection efforts to include: (1) incorporating questions into public health surveys, questionnaires, and other databases in existence as of the date of the enactment of this Act; and (2) the consideration and development of a patient registry. Encourages the Director of the National Institutes of Health to explore the development of a virtual Center of Excellence for Collaborative Discovery in Psoriasis and Comorbid Research or some other mechanism through which public and private sector findings regarding psoriasis and its comorbid conditions can be regularly shared and leveraged."
