Defines \"major transit facility\" to mean: (1) a station that is part of a fixed-guideway public transportation system, (2) a high-speed rail or intercity rail station, (3) a transit hub, or (4) a transit center located in a nonurbanized area. Authorizes the Secretary to make or guarantee loans to eligible borrowers to carry out such projects."
