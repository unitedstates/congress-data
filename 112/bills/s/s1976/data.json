Terminates the availability of assistance for either such discipline when the Secretary certifies that there no longer exists a current or projected shortfall in qualified personnel in that discipline in either the military departments or any major military medical treatment facility specializing in the rehabilitation of wounded Armed Forces members. Declares that assistance under this Act, if not already terminated, shall expire two years after enactment of this Act, provided that such expiration is not construed to terminate ongoing assistance to persons provided assistance before or as of such date."
