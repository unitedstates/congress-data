Expands the list of organizations exempt from such prohibitions (thereby permitting the educational agencies or institutions participating in a Department of Education program to release records or identifiable information to such organizations without parental consent) to include: (1) organizations conducting studies for, or on behalf of, child welfare agencies to improve educational outcomes for students in foster care; and (2) state or local welfare agencies or tribal organizations responsible for a student's placement and care, provided that any disclosure of records for a student's educational needs is consistent with confidentiality laws in the state applicable to personal records. Permits the release of such records and information without additional notice to parents and students when a parent is a party to a child welfare court proceeding and a court order has already been issued in the context of that proceeding."
