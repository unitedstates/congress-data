Limits the fee to: (1) $2 per passenger charged for the first checked or carried on bag, or (2) $260 million in the aggregate on all air carriers in a year. Requires such fees to be credited as offsetting collections to the Secretary for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for aviation security."
