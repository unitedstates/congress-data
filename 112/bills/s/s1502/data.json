    "text": "Clean Rivers Act of 2011 - Directs the Administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) to review the adequacy of PHMSA regulations with respect to PHMSA-regulated pipelines that cross rivers with a width of at least 100 feet from high water mark to high water mark. Requires the Administrator to establish on a publicly available PHMSA website: (1) a database of all pipeline water crossings in the United States, (2) a listing of national and state statistics on pipeline safety, and (3) certain information regarding pipeline operator hazardous liquid pipeline response plans. Directs the Administrator to review: (1) the need for performance standards for leak detection systems used by hazardous liquid pipeline facility operators, and (2) the adequacy of PHMSA regulations in cases where a hazardous liquid pipeline facility operator must use an emergency flow restricting device. Requires the Administrator to review and report to Congress on all onshore gas and hazardous liquid gathering lines not regulated by PHMSA. Requires revision of the National Contingency Plan for removal of oil and hazardous substances to provide greater involvement of local authorities in the basic framework for the response management structure."
