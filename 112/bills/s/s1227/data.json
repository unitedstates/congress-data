Requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop a national Arctic health science policy, reviewing and taking into consideration the National Arctic Health Science Policy developed by the American Public Health Association Task Force in 1984. Amends the Public Health Service Act to establish a Desk for Arctic Health to: (1) work with the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee to ensure adequate health representation from federal agencies, (2) collaborate and consult with governmental entities and U.S. nongovernmental organizations involved in Arctic health issues, and (3) collaborate with the Canadian Institutes of Health Research on indigenous Arctic people health issues. Directs the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to establish a program at the National Center of Environmental Health to foster advances and help provide technical support in the field of Arctic health impact assessments."
