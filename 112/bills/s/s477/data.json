Imposes limitations on government travel and subsistence expenses, except for expenses incurred for threatened law enforcement personnel and for other expenses related to national security or public safety. Rescinds in FY2011 20% of the funding for the acquisition of new vehicles for the federal fleet by the General Services Administration (GSA). Imposes limitations on such funding in FY2012 and subsequent fiscal years."
