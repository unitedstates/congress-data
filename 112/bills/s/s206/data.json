Prescribes special rules for funding opportunity scholarships for DC students. Prescribes requirements for schools participating in such grant programs. Requires each participating school to administer a nationally norm-referenced standardized test in reading and mathematics to each enrolled student receiving an opportunity scholarship. Repeals the DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003 (title III of division C of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004). Deems this Act as the reauthorization of the opportunity scholarship program under such Act."
