Defines \"applicable leased highway property\" as property subject to a lease between a taxpayer and a governmental entity under which the taxpayer leases a highway and associated improvements, receives a right-of-way on public lands underlying such highway and improvements, and receives a grant of a franchise or other intangible right to receive payments relating to the operation of such highway. Prohibits private activity bond financing of applicable leased highway property."
