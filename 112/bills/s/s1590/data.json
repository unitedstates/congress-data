Requires: (1) the Federal Acquisition Regulation to be amended to integrate the new system, and (2) the Administrator of General Services to integrate the new system into the Integrated Acquisition Environment. Directs the SBA Administrator to: (1) eliminate the nonmanufacturer exception to small business size determinations, (2) require contracting officers to use the size standard established for retail and wholesale industries in federal procurements for products and services that are not manufactured by the offeror, and (3) require such officers to use only SBA size standards for manufacturing industries if the federal government issues a contract for the purchase of a product or good that is manufactured by the offeror."
