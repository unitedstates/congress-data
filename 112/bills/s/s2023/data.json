    "text": "Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to prescribe regulations requiring each motor carrier owning or leasing at least one motorcoach transporting passengers subject to DOT jurisdiction to display prominently in each motorcoach an understandable letter grade rating system allowing motorcoach passengers to compare the safety performance of motorcoach operators. Requires that such regulations also require motor carriers and any person selling motorcoach tickets to display the rating system in all announcements, advertisements, and points of sale for such motorcoach services and operations. Defines \"motorcoach\" as the term \"over-the-road bus\" is defined under the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, except that \"motorcoach\": (1) includes a motor vehicle used to transport passengers that has a gross vehicle weight of at least 10,001 pounds, and (2) excludes a bus used in public transportation that is provided by a state or local government or a school bus."
