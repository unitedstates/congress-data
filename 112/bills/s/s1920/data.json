    "text": "Saving Money and Reducing Tragedies through Prevention Act of 2011 or the SMART Prevention Act of 2011 - Amends the Violence against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA) to replace provisions regarding grants to assist children and youth exposed to violence with a Saving Money and Reducing Tragedies through Prevention (SMART Prevention) grant program. Authorizes the Attorney General to award grants for the purpose of preventing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking (such violence) by taking a comprehensive approach that focuses on youth, children exposed to violence, and men as leaders and influencers of social norms. Permits the use of grant funds to develop, maintain, or enhance programs that: (1) change attitudes and behaviors around the acceptability of such violence and provide education and skills training to young individuals and those who influence them; (2) are designed to prevent future incidents of such violence by preventing, reducing, and responding to children's exposure to violence in the home; and (3) work with men to prevent such violence by helping men to serve as role models and social influencers of other men and youth at the individual, school, community, or statewide levels. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) eligible entities to receive grants; (2) grantee requirements; and (3) fund allotments, including for Indian tribes or tribal organizations. Repeals provisions of: (1) VAWA regarding development of curricula and pilot programs for home visitation projects and regarding engaging men and youth in preventing such violence, and (2) the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 regarding a public awareness campaign regarding domestic violence against pregnant women."
