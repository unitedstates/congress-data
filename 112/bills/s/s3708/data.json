    "text": "Stop Abuse For Every Child Act of 2012 or the SAFE Child Act - Amends the federal criminal code to require the court to impose an additional special assessment equal to three times the amount assessed under current law on persons convicted of specified offenses (other than individuals convicted of an offense against the United States). Establishes a Surcharge Fund, to be administered by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), into which such assessments shall be deposited and from which the Secretary shall make a competitive grant every three years to a private nonprofit organization to operate a national child abuse hotline, encourage reporting of child abuse, and conduct public education on child abuse. Requires unobligated funds to be transferred to the Crime Victims Fund."
