Establishes the goals of such Program as: (1) eradicating nutria in Maryland; (2) eradicating or controlling nutria in Louisiana, Delaware, North Carolina, Oregon, Virginia, and Washington; and (3) restoring\u00a0wetlands damaged by nutria. Requires that the Maryland program consist of management, research, and public education activities carried out in accordance with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service's document entitled \"Eradication Strategies for Nutria in the Chesapeake and Delaware Bay Watersheds,\" dated March 2002 and\u00a0updated in March 2009. Authorizes appropriations for such program for FY2012-FY2016 for financial assistance to the state of Maryland, the state of Louisiana, and on a competitive basis, to other coastal states. Requires the Secretary and the National Invasive Species Council to develop long-term nutria control or eradication programs to: (1) significantly reduce and restore nutria damaged wetlands in\u00a0Delaware, Oregon, North Carolina, Virginia, and Washington; and (2) promote voluntary, public-private partnerships to eradicate or control nutria and restore nutria-damaged wetlands in such states."
