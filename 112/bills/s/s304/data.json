Modifies grant requirements by replacing the current ones with a mandatory certification by the Governor of Alaska that there is a need for the funds in order to ensure an adequately skilled, safe, and competent workforce to construct, operate, and maintain: (1) an Alaska natural gas pipeline system; or (2) all related environmental processes involving existing and future oil and gas infrastructure in Alaska. Increases from 15% to 50% the amount of federal funds that may be used for such training facility."
