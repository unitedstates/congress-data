    "text": "Student Right to Know Before You Go Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require institutions of higher education (IHEs) participating in title IV (Student Assistance) programs to participate in, and provide all the data required for, an individual-level integrated postsecondary education data system administered by a state, a multi-state compact, or the Secretary of Education. Allows system administrators to include, in addition to data from IHEs, data from certain other postsecondary education and training programs. Requires the systems to be certified by the Secretary as meeting certain data inclusion, quality, governance, and privacy requirements. Requires the systems to include: (1) all student components of reporting required for the Integrated Postsecondary Data System (IPEDS), and submit such data to IPEDS; (2) rates of remedial enrollment, credit accumulation, and postsecondary completion by high school completion status; and (3) earnings data, disaggregated by educational program, institution, degree, employment sector, and state to create an interoperable employment and learning exchange. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to educational institutions and system administrators to assist them in complying with, developing, and implementing individual-level integrated postsecondary education data systems."
