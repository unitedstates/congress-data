    "text": "First State National Historical Park Act - Establishes the First State National Historical Park in Delaware, to be administered as a unit of the National Park System. Specifies that the purpose of the Park is the preservation, protection, and interpretation of the nationally significant cultural and historic resources associated with early Dutch, Swedish, and English settlement of the colony of Delaware and Delaware's role as the first state to ratify the Constitution. Bars the establishment of the Park until it is determined that sufficient land or interests have been acquired from among specified historic sites within the boundary of the Park to constitute a manageable park unit. Instructs the Secretary to publish a notice in the Federal Register of the Park's establishment, including an official boundary map. Allows the the Secretary to acquire, by purchase from a willing seller, donation, or exchange, all or a part of any of such sites, including easements or other interests. Adjusts the boundary of the Park to reflect the acquisition of lands or interests in such sites. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) provide interpretive tours to sites and resources in Delaware located outside the Park's boundary and associated with the purposes for which the Park is established under this Act; and (2) enter into cooperative agreements with Delaware and other specified entities to mark, interpret, and restore nationally significant historic or cultural resources within the Park, if those agreements provide for reasonable public access to such resources. Limits the federal share of the total cost of any activity carried out under such an agreement to 50% of that cost. Permits the non-federal share to be in the form of in-kind contributions or goods or services fairly valued. Requires the completion of a management plan for the Park. Requires completion of a study assessing the historical significance of additional properties in Delaware associated with the Park. Requires such study to include an assessment of the potential for designating such properties as National Historic Landmarks. Authorizes appropriations."
