Requires the Director of the Center for Mental Health Services to designate a Deputy Director for Older Adult Mental Health Services to develop and implement initiatives to address the mental health needs of older adults. Includes representatives of older adults or their families and geriatric mental health professionals on the Advisory Council for the Center.
