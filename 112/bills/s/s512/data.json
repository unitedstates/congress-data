Requires the Secretary to select proposals for such cooperative agreements through the use of competitive procedures and an impartial review of their scientific and technical merit. Sets forth cost-share requirements under which the non-federal source must provide at least: (1) 50% of the cost of the development of each small modular reactor design and each early site permit, and (2) 75% of the cost of the licensing demonstration of each small modular reactor design."
