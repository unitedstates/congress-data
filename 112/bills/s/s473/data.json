    "text": "Continuing Chemical Facilities Antiterrorism Security Act of 2011 - Amends the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007 to extend until October 4, 2014, the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to issue interim final regulations establishing risk-based performance standards for security of chemical facilities and requiring vulnerability assessments and the development and implementation of site security plans for such facilities. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and in coordination with the Under Secretary for National Protection and Programs, to: (1) establish a voluntary chemical security training program to enhance the capabilities of covered chemical facilities (chemical facilities subject to the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards [CFATS]) to prevent, prepare for, respond to, mitigate against, and recover from acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and other man-made disasters; and (2) develop a voluntary chemical security exercise program to offer voluntary testing and evaluation of the capabilities of the federal government, state governments, commercial personnel and management, emergency response providers, and the private sector to prevent, prepare for, mitigate against, respond to, and recover from acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and other emergencies at covered chemical facilities. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection and in coordination with the Under Secretary for Science and Technology, to establish a voluntary technical assistance program under which the Secretary may, upon request, provide the owner or operator of a covered facility nonbinding assistance or recommendations to: (1) reduce the risk or consequences associated with a successful act of terrorism against a covered chemical facility, or (2) aid in compliance with the risk-based performance standards applicable to that facility under CFATS. Requires the Secretary to: (1) develop a repository for information and data on best practices and cost-effective technologies for implementing CFATS and the voluntary technical assistance program, (2) submit a report regarding lessons learned from that program, and (3) establish a Chemical Facility Security Advisory Board to advise the Secretary on CFATS implementation. Terminates this Act on October 4, 2014."
