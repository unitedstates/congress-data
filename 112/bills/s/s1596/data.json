States that this prohibition does not apply to: (1) any federal-aid system highway segment that will have the same number of nontoll lanes as existed before a toll is imposed, or (2) any high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane converted to a toll lane if an HOV may use the toll lane without paying a toll or the HOV lane was constructed as a temporary lane to be replaced by a toll lane.

(Sec. 203) Directs the Secretary to make a grant under certain authority of the AIDS Housing Opportunity Act for any state that received an allocation in a prior fiscal year, but is not otherwise eligible for an FY2012 allocation because the areas in the state outside of qualifying metropolitan statistical areas do not have the number of cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) otherwise required. Prescribes a formula for the allocation of such grants to Jersey City and Paterson, New Jersey. (Sec. 204) Requires any grant, cooperative agreement, or other assistance made pursuant to this title to be made on a competitive basis and in accordance with the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989. (Sec. 205) Makes certain funds available, without regard to limitations on administrative expenses, for: (1) legal services on a contract or fee basis; and (2) payment for services and facilities of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), Ginnie Mae, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), the Federal Financing Bank, Federal Reserve banks, Federal Home Loan banks, and any bank insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Act.

(Sec. 209) Requires the Secretary to: (1) adjust the funds allocated for FY2012 under the AIDS Housing Opportunity Act to Wilmington, Delaware, on behalf of the Wilmington, Delaware-Maryland-New Jersey Metropolitan Division; and (2) allocate a portion to the state of New Jersey according to a specified formula. Directs the Secretary to allocate to Wake County, North Carolina, certain funds that otherwise would be allocated for FY2012 under such Act to Raleigh, North Carolina, on behalf of the Raleigh-Cary, North Carolina Metropolitan Statistical Area. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) adjust FY2012 allocations under such Act upon the written request of a grant applicant for a formula allocation on behalf of a metropolitan statistical area; and (2) designate the state or states in which the metropolitan statistical area is located as the eligible grantee(s) of the allocation. (Sec. 210) Requires the President's formal budget request for FY2013 and HUD's congressional budget justifications to use the identical account and subaccount structure provided under this Act. (Sec. 211) Declares that a public housing agency (PHA), or other entity, that administers federal housing assistance for the Housing Authority of the county of Los Angeles, California, or the states of Alaska, Iowa, or Mississippi shall not be required to include a resident of public housing or a recipient of section 8 rental assistance (under the United States Housing Act of 1937) on the agency or entity governing board. Requires each such PHA (or other entity) that chooses not to include such individuals on its governing board to establish an advisory board, which shall meet at least quarterly, consisting of at least six residents of public housing or section 8 rental assistance recipients. (Sec. 212) Authorizes the Secretary for FY2012-FY2013, subject to specified conditions, to authorize the transfer of some or all project-based assistance, debt, and statutorily required low-income and very low-income use restrictions, associated with one or more multifamily housing project, to another multifamily housing project or projects.

(Sec. 215) Prohibits any section 8 rental assistance to any individual who: (1) is enrolled as a student at an institution of higher education; (2) is under age 24; (3) is not a veteran; (4) is unmarried; (5) does not have a dependent child; (6) is not a person with disabilities, and was not receiving section 8 assistance as of November 30, 2005; and (7) is not otherwise individually eligible, or has parents who, individually or jointly, are not eligible, to receive such assistance. Declares that, for section 8 rental assistance eligibility purposes, any financial assistance (in excess of amounts received for tuition) that an individual receives under the Higher Education Act of 1965, from private sources, or an institution of higher education shall be considered income to that individual, except for a person over age 23 with dependent children. (Sec. 216) Authorizes the Secretary through FY2012 to insure, and enter into commitments to insure, home equity conversion mortgages (HECMs, or reverse mortgages) for elderly homeowners.

Authorizes the Secretary, however, to the extent that such a multifamily property is not feasible for continued payments, based on specified cost, operation, or environmental considerations, to: (1) contract, in consultation with the property's tenants, for project-based rental assistance payments with an owner or owners of other existing housing properties; or (2) provide other rental assistance. (Sec. 218) States that, during FY2012, a family residing in an assisted living facility in any county of Michigan with a section 8 rental assistance demonstration program, and on behalf of which a PHA provides such assistance, may be required, when the family initially receives the assistance, to pay rent in an amount exceeding 40% of the family's monthly adjusted income by any percentage or amount the Secretary determines appropriate. (Sec. 219) Requires the Secretary to report quarterly to congressional appropriations committees on HUD use of all sole source contracts. (Sec. 220) Authorizes any recipient after December 26, 2000, of a grant for conversion of elderly housing to assisted living facilities to: (1) establish a single-asset nonprofit entity to own the project; and (2) lend the grant funds to such entity, which may be a for-profit limited partnership the sole general partner of which is a private nonprofit organization meeting specified requirements, or a corporation wholly owned and controlled by such a private nonprofit organization. (Sec. 221) Authorizes the use of Community Development Loan Guarantee funds in FY2012 and thereafter to guarantee, or make commitments to guarantee, notes or other obligations issued by any state on behalf of its non-entitlement communities. (Sec. 222) Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to extend through FY2012 the authorization of appropriations for demolition, site revitalization, replacement housing, and tenant-based assistance project grants to PHAs. (Sec. 223) Authorizes PHAs that own and operate 400 or fewer public housing units to elect to be exempt from any asset management requirements imposed by the Secretary in connection with the operating fund rule. Prohibits exemption from such requirements, however, for an agency seeking a discontinuance of a reduction of subsidy under the operating fund formula. (Sec. 224) Prohibits the Secretary, with respect to the use of funds for the operation, capital improvement, and management of public housing authorized by the United States Housing Act of 1937, from imposing any asset management requirement or guideline that restricts or limits in any way the use of capital funds for central office costs. Prohibits a PHA, however, from using capital funds authorized for eligible operation and management activities with operating funds in excess of specified permitted amounts. (Sec. 225) Prohibits designation of a HUD official or employee as an allotment holder unless he or she has: (1) implemented an adequate system of funds control, and (2) received training in funds control procedures and directives. (Sec. 226) Requires the Secretary to report quarterly to congressional appropriations committees on the status of all section 8 project-based housing, including the number of all project-based units by region as well as an analysis of all federally subsidized housing being refinanced under the Mark-to-Market program. (Sec. 227) Requires payment of attorney fees in program-related litigation from individual program office personnel benefits and compensation funding. (Sec. 228) Requires the Secretary for FY2012 and thereafter to notify the public through the Federal Register and other appropriate means of the issuance of a notice of the availability of assistance or notice of funding availability (NOFA) for any program or discretionary fund that is to be awarded competitively. Authorizes the Secretary for such period to make the NOFA available only on the Internet at the appropriate government website or through other electronic media. (Sec. 229) Prohibits the availability to any homeless group of designated surplus federal property unless the group is a member in good standing under any of HUD's homeless assistance programs or is in good standing with any other program receiving federal or state funds. Allows an exception to this requirement for an entity not involved with federal homeless programs if it meets specified financial, track record, and property management requirements. (Sec. 231) Considers the HUD-administered Disaster Housing Assistance Programs as a HUD program under the McKinney Act for income verification and matching purposes. (Sec. 232) Allows up to $10 million out of funds appropriated for salaries and expenses under all accounts under this title (except for the Office of Inspector General account) to be transferred to and merged with amounts appropriated for the Working Capital Fund account. (Sec. 233) Amends the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 and the Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, the Judiciary, the District of Columbia, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006 to repeal the required transfer to the Flexible Subsidy Fund of all uncommitted balances of certain excess rental charges in the Rental Housing Assistance Fund and any collections made during FY2005, FY2006, or subsequent fiscal years. (Sec. 234) Authorizes the Secretary to increase the number of Moving-to-Work agencies authorized under the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996 by adding to the program up to three PHAs that are High Performing Agencies under the Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS) or the Section Eight Management Assessment Program (SEMAP). Prohibits designation, however, of any PHA that administers more than 10,000 aggregate housing vouchers and public housing units. States that no PHA granted this designation shall receive more funding under sections 8 or 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 than they otherwise would have received without this designation. (Sec. 235) Rescinds specified unobligated balances remaining from funds appropriated for tenant-based rental assistance under the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011. (Sec. 236) Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 with respect to the rental assistance programs. States that, after the initial review of a family with a fixed income, the PHA or owner shall not be required to conduct a review of the family's income for any year for which such family certifies that: (1) 90% or more of its income is fixed, and (2) the sources of such income have not changed since the previous year. Requires the PHA or owner to conduct such family's income at least once every three years. (Thus exempting such family's fixed income from the annual review requirement under the Act.) Defines \"extremely low-income families\" as very low-income families whose incomes do not exceed the higher of: (1) specified poverty guidelines updated periodically by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), or (2) 30% of the median family income for the area, with adjustments for smaller and larger families. Authorizes the Secretary to establish income ceilings higher or lower than 30% if necessary because of unusually high or low family incomes. Makes such authority inapplicable in the case of PHAs located in Puerto Rico or any other U.S. territory or possession. Requires the Secretary to periodically, but at least annually, determine or establish area median incomes and income ceilings and limits. Increases the mandatory family income exclusion from: (1) $400 to $675 for the elderly or disabled allowance in a family's annual income, and (2) 3% to 10% for the threshold for medical expenses. Revises procedures under the section 8 rental assistance program for publishing fair market rentals for an area with respect to the amount and scope of monthly assistance payments. Requires the Secretary to publish such rentals at least annually on HUD's website and in any other manner specified by the Secretary. Repeals the Secretary's requirement to establish separate fair market rentals for: (1) Westchester County, New York; and (2) Monroe County, Pennsylvania. Repeals the requirement that if units receiving rental assistance payments are exempt from local rent control while being assisted or otherwise, the maximum monthly rent for such units shall be reasonable in comparison with other units in the market area that are exempt from local rent control. Declares that no PHA shall be required, as a result of a reduction in the fair market rental, to reduce the payment standard applied to a family continuing to reside in a unit for which the family was receiving section 8 voucher assistance at the time the fair market rental was reduced. Requires the Secretary to allow PHAs to request exception payment standards within fair market rental areas subject to criteria and procedures established by the Secretary. Authorizes a PHA to: (1) establish a payment standard of up to 120% of the fair market rent, where necessary, as a reasonable accommodation for a person with a disability, without the Secretary's approval; and (2) seek approval to use a payment standard greater than 120% of the fair market rent as a reasonable accommodation for a disabled family or other family with a person with a disability. Prohibits the Secretary, in connection with the use of any increased payment standard, from establishing additional requirements regarding the amount of adjusted income paid by such person for rent. Revises income eligibility requirements for public housing, for tenant-based section 8 assistance, and for project-based section 8 assistance to substitute \"extremely low-income families\" for the respective eligibility formula (all of which formulae are identical with the definition of \"extremely low-income families\" added by this section). (Sec. 236 [sic]) Amends the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 to extend the Mark-to-Market program through October 1, 2015. Title III: Related Agencies - Makes appropriations for FY2012 to: (1) the Access Board, (2) the Federal Maritime Commission, (3) the Office of Inspector General for the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), (4) the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), (5) the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, and (6) the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. Title IV: General Provisions (This Act) - Specifies certain uses and limits on or prohibitions against the use of funds appropriated by this Act. (Sec. 401) Requires any sums necessary for FY2012 pay raises for programs funded in this Act to be absorbed within the levels appropriated in this or previous appropriations Acts. (Sec. 402) Prohibits the use of funds for the planning or execution of any program to pay the expenses of, or otherwise compensate, nonfederal parties intervening in regulatory or adjudicatory proceedings funded in this Act. (Sec. 407) Requires all federal agencies and departments funded by this Act to report by July 30, 2012, to the congressional appropriations committees on all sole source contracts. (Sec. 409) Prohibits the use of funds to support any federal, state, or local projects that seek to use the power of eminent domain, unless eminent domain is employed only for a public use. (Sec. 411) Prohibits payment of the salary from any appropriation under this Act for any person filling a position (other than temporary) formerly held by an employee who has: (1) left to enter the U.S. Armed Forces; (2) satisfactorily completed his or her period of active military or naval service; (3) within 90 days after release from such service, or from hospitalization continuing after discharge for up to one year, applied for restoration to his former position; and (4) been certified by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) as still qualified to perform the duties of his or her former position, but not been restored to it. (Sec. 412) Prohibits the expenditure of funds appropriated under this Act by an entity unless the entity agrees to comply with the Buy American Act. (Sec. 413) Prohibits the availability of funds to any person or entity that has been convicted of violating the Buy American Act. (Sec. 414) Prohibits the use of funds under this Act for first-class airline accommodations in contravention of specified federal regulations. (Sec. 415) Prohibits the use of funds under this Act to purchase a light bulb for an office building unless it has, to the extent practicable, an Energy Star or Federal Energy Management Program designation. (Sec. 416) Bars the use of funds under this Act to prohibit or restrict the establishment or effectiveness of an occupancy preference for veterans in supportive housing for the elderly that: (1) is provided HUD assistance; and (2) is or would be located on Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) property, or is subject to an enhanced use lease with the VA. (Sec. 417) Prohibits the provision of any funds made available under this or prior Acts to the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or allied organizations. (Sec. 418) Prescribes requirements for the posting on DOT or HUD websites of certain information regarding any competitive grant or credit assistance program. Requires the DOT and HUD Secretaries, concurrent with the issuance of any NOFA or other notice designed to solicit applications for funding issued for such a program, to post on their websites certain information, including: (1) the goals of the program, (2) the criteria that will be used in awarding such grants or credit assistance, and (3) the process by which applications will be selected. Requires the posting on such websites, concurrent with the public announcement of the grants or credit assistance to be awarded, of additional specified information on each selectee."
