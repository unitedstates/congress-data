Directs the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to publish a model form for describing those obligations. Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require institutions of higher education to provide borrowers of federal educational loans information at their entrance counseling on the effect their death, disability, or inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity would have on their federal and private educational loans."
