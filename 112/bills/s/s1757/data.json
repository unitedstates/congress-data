    "text": "Clean Energy Infrastructure for Rural Communities Act of 2011 - Amends the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to make electric loans for transmission facilities primarily for interconnecting renewable energy facilities to a high-voltage transmission line. Revokes the requirement that the rate of an electric loan for renewable energy be equal to the average tax-exempt municipal bond rate of similar maturities. Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to: (1) authorize the Secretary to make and insure loans to improve the economic and environmental climate by encouraging the development and construction of infrastructure to provide access to natural gas in rural communities, and (2) define \"natural gas\" as unmixed natural gas or any mixture of natural and artificial gas."
