Requires the USTR to report annually to Congress on: (1) actions taken by the Russian Federation to comply with its commitments under the protocol that has a significant effect on U.S. commerce, (2) any commitment the Federation is not implementing or is not making progress toward implementing in a timely manner, and (3) any actions taken by the USTR to obtain Russian Federation compliance with its commitments. Directs the USTR to take appropriate action to obtain Russian Federation compliance with commitments it is not implementing or is not making progress toward implementing in a timely manner. Authorizes the USTR, however, not to take any action if it is not in the U.S. national interest. Requires the USTR to seek public participation in developing such reports and in determining what action, if any, to take with respect to any commitment the Russian Federation is not implementing or is not making progress toward implementing in a timely manner."
