    "text": "Community Parks Revitalization Act - Requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to promulgate regulations establishing a community revitalization program to provide federal grants to eligible local governments for various park and recreation purposes, including grants for rehabilitation and construction, innovation and recreation programming, and recovery action programs. Authorizes the Secretary to designate local governments in standard metropolitan statistical areas not meeting program eligibility requirements to receive such grants, out of up to 15% of funds appropriated for them, under a partial eligibility waiver. Authorizes the Secretary, upon approval of an application by the chief executive of an eligible applicant, to provide 70% matching rehabilitation and construction, and innovation and recreation program grants directly to such applicant. Allows a recipient, at its discretion, to transfer a grant in whole or in part to private nonprofit agencies for recreational areas and facilities they own or operate which offer recreational opportunities to the general population. Requires an applicant, for project approval, to submit to the Secretary evidence of its commitment to ongoing planning, rehabilitation, service, operation, and maintenance programs for its park and recreation systems, expressed in a five-year local park and recreation recovery action program. Prescribes requirements for the five-year park and recreation recovery action program under an at-risk youth recreation grant. Authorizes the Secretary to increase all grants to a state under this Act by up to 15% (but not more than 85%) of total project or program cost. Prohibits the conversion, without HUD approval, of any property improved or developed with assistance under this Act for uses other than for public recreation. Limits to 10% the use of funds appropriated for rehabilitation and construction grants for acquisition of land or interests in land."
