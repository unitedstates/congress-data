    "text": "Dietary Supplement Labeling Act of 2011 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to expand the registration requirements for a dietary supplement manufacturing facility to: (1) require the submission of a description, ingredient list, and label and labeling for each dietary supplement product manufactured; and (2) require a manufacturer to update its registration for new, reformulated, or discontinued products within 30 days. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to compile a list of dietary supplement ingredients and proprietary blends of ingredients that the Secretary determines could cause potentially serious adverse events, drug interactions, contraindications, or potential risks to subgroups such as children and pregnant or breastfeeding women. Directs the Secretary to enter into a contract with the Institute of Medicine to: (1) evaluate the safety of dietary supplement ingredients and proprietary blends of ingredients that the Institute determines could cause potentially serious adverse events, drug interactions, contraindications, or potential risks to subgroups; and (2) identify proprietary blends of ingredients for which the weight per serving of the ingredient in the proprietary blend should be provided on the label. Deems a dietary supplement that does not meet the requirements of this Act to be misbranded. Requires the Secretary to establish a definition for the term \u201cconventional food\u201d for purposes of the FFDCA, taking in account foods marketed as dietary supplements."
