Requires the Secretary to provide that the Secretary shall not make any tract available for lease within such schedule if the President determines that its lease would conflict with military operations relating to national security. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to deposit: (1) 50% of qualified revenues in the general fund of the Treasury, and (2) 50% in a special account for disbursement to Virginia and for designated state activities. Directs the Secretary to revise a certain Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement map to ensure that the square footage of the leasable area in the Mid-Atlantic planning area is directly proportional to the length of the tidal shoreline of the Mid-Atlantic States."
