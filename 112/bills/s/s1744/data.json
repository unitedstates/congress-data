Requires the Assistant Secretary to submit to the State Justice Institute recommendations for the awarding of such grants and contracts. Authorizes the award of grants to enable the highest court of each state to: (1) conduct assessments used with respect to a full, limited, or temporary adult guardianship or conservatorship; (2) implement necessary changes in light of them; and (3) collect necessary data regarding those proceedings and the impact of the necessary changes. Requires the Assistant Secretary to set aside 25% of amounts made available for grants in each fiscal year to enable courts to implement or improve systems to conduct background checks on prospective guardians and conservators."
