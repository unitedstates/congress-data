Expands executive authority to reorganize federal agencies by allowing: (1) the creation of a new executive department or the abolition or renaming of an existing department, (2) the consolidation of two or more departments, and (3) the creation of a new agency that is not a component or part of an existing executive department. Allows a provision in a reorganization plan to take effect only if such plan is transmitted to Congress within two years of the enactment of this Act and is an efficiency-enhancing plan."
