    "text": "Alaska Hero's Card Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to establish a two-year pilot program assessing the feasibility and advisability of carrying out a program by which certain veterans entitled to VA services residing in communities in the state of Alaska that are inaccessible by motor vehicle can, subject to exceptions, receive necessary hospital care or medical services at any hospital or medical facility or from any medical provider eligible to receive payments under: (1) titles XVIII (Medicare) or XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act, (2) the TRICARE program (a Department of Defense [DOD] managed health care program), or (3) the Indian health program. Requires the cost of any hospital care or medical service provided under the pilot program to be borne by the United States from amounts other than amounts appropriated or otherwise made available for an Indian health program. Directs the Secretary to take measures ensuring that covered veterans are not billed for hospital care and medical services received under the pilot program. Requires the Secretary, in carrying out the pilot program, to issue to each covered veteran a card to be known as an \"Alaska Hero Card\" that such veteran may present to an authorized provider to establish the covered veteran's eligibility for hospital care and medical services under the pilot program. Authorizes the Secretary to establish a list of authorized providers from whom a covered veteran may receive hospital care and medical services under the pilot program."
