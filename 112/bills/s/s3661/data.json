Requires the Administrator of NASA to submit to Congress a strategy for achieving the long-term goal of sustainably expanding a human presence beyond low-Earth orbit through robust use of cis-lunar space. Instructs NASA to proceed with the utilization of the International Space Station, technology development, and follow-on transportation systems, including the space launch system and the multi-purpose crew vehicle."
