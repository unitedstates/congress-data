    "text": "Anti-Cash Smuggling Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to require reports concerning means of access to funds or the value of funds belonging or credited to a person (or agent or bailee), including prepaid or stored value cards (but not debit or credit cards), that can be used electronically to: (1) initiate a transfer of funds, (2) obtain currency in place of funds or the value of funds, or (3) purchase goods or services. Requires such reports to be filed only when a person knowingly: (1) transports, is about to transport, or has transported a means of access to funds or the value of funds of more than $10,000 at one time from a place in the United States to or through a place outside the United States, or to a place in the United States from or through a place outside the United States; or (2) receives a means of access to funds or the value of funds transported into the United States from or through a place outside the United States of more than $10,000 at one time. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to apply to a court for a search warrant upon a reasonable belief that: (1) a monetary instrument or a tangible mechanism that constitutes a means of access to funds or the value of funds is being transported; and (2) a required report has not been filed or contains a material omission or misstatement. Revises penalties and procedures regarding smuggling of cash, monetary instruments, and means of access to funds or the value of funds into or out of the United States."
