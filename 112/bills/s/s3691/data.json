Requires the Plan to include the establishment of an online, publicly available information clearinghouse to be used by federal agencies and other stakeholders to inform resilience-enhancing efforts and to build off and complement existing federal efforts. Provides for a coordinating entity to establish and maintain such clearinghouse. Requires such coordinating entity to coordinate the implementation of the Plan and to track its progress. Requires the submission of specified reports."
