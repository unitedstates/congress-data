Includes in these lands certain sites: (1) identified on specified maps as having traditional, recreational, and renewable energy use value; and (2) identified by Sealaska as having sacred, cultural, traditional, or historic significance. Prohibits Sealaska from selecting: (1) sacred, cultural, traditional, or historic sites that are within the National Park System; or (2) land from the mapped sites, other than trade and migration route land, that lies within a conservation system unit. (A conservation system unit includes any unit of the National Park System, National Wildlife Refuge System, National Wild and Scenic Rivers Systems, National Trails System, National Wilderness Preservation System, or a National Forest Monument.) Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act to designate specified lands within Tongass National Forest as conservation areas that are to be given Land Use Designation II status and managed by the Secretary of Agriculture to protect subsistence activities and unique biological and geological resources, and prohibit commercial timber harvests or new road construction."
