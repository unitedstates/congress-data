Urges: (1) the allocation of funding for bilateral assistance programs in Syria; and (2) the United States to work with other donor nations to increase international contributions for the people of Syria; (3) the President to increase bilateral funding to countries, including Iraq, Jordan, Turkey, and Lebanon, that have experienced an influx of Syrian refugees; and (4) the United States to work with regional partners to secure conventional and unconventional weapons stockpiles in Syria and prevent their illicit sale or transfer out of Syria. Directs the President to instruct the Secretary of State to work with the appropriate United Nations (U.N.) agencies, regional organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and the broader international community to establish an international donors group to provide humanitarian assistance for the people of Syria."
