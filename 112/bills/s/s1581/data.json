    "text": "Fighting for American Industry's Right to Enforcement Against Duty Evasion Act or FAIR Enforcement Against Duty Evasion Act of 2011 - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to eliminate the option of an importer to post a bond or security in lieu of a cash deposit for each entry of merchandise exported into the United States by a new exporter (shipper) and producer that is the subject of a review by the administering authority as to whether antidumping or countervailing duties shall be imposed on such merchandise. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe minimum standards to require customs brokers to implement, and customers (importers) to comply with, reasonable procedures for collecting information to identify U.S. and non-U.S. customers seeking to import merchandise into the United States. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress recommendations for: (1) determining the most effective way to require foreign nationals to provide customs brokers and federal agencies with accurate information, comparable to that required of U.S. nationals, on the identity of foreign nationals seeking to import merchandise into the United States; and (2) establishing a system for such brokers and agencies to review information maintained by relevant federal agencies to verify the identity of foreign nationals and U.S. nationals who seek to import merchandise into the United States. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to implement certain modifications to the importer of record database."
