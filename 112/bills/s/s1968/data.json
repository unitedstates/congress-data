Requires states and metropolitan planning organizations participating in the program to work cooperatively with the Secretary to: (1) evaluate the methods and metrics they use in measuring their effectiveness in achieving national transportation goals, and (2) identify steps to improve those methods and metrics. Authorizes the Secretary to provide financial assistance to program participants to assist them in these efforts.
