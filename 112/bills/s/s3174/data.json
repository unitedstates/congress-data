Prohibits the Administrator from requiring matching funds as a grant condition. Requires: (1) grant recipients to report to the Administrator on their use of funds, and (2) the Administrator to submit to Congress a program evaluation. Directs the association of small business development centers to act as an information clearinghouse regarding vocational and technical entrepreneurship education programs."
