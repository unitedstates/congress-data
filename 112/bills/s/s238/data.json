Requires such FISs to: (1) be prepared by an objective person (prohibits U.S. government officers, employees, or entities) selected by the Comptroller General; and (2) determine if the fishery management plan or amendment is consistent with specified national standards for fishery conservation and management, including whether the relevant measures provide for the sustained participation of fishing communities and minimize adverse economic impacts on such communities. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, after an updated FIS is published, to prepare and begin implementing a comprehensive mitigation plan to: (1) address any identified negative economic or social impacts, and (2) correct specified inconsistencies."
