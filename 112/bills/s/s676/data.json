(This effectively overrules the Supreme Court's decision in Carcieri v. Salazar, which held that the Secretary of the Interior could not take land into trust for a specified tribe because that tribe had not been under federal jurisdiction when the Act was enacted.) Ratifies and confirms any action taken by the Secretary pursuant to such Act for any Indian tribe that was federally recognized on the date of that action. Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on the effects of Carcieri v. Salazar, including a list, which is to be published, of each tribe and parcel of tribal land affected by that decision."
