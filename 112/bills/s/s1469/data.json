    "text": "International Cybercrime Reporting and Cooperation Act - Directs a presidentially-designated federal agency to report annually to Congress assessing: (1) the extent and nature of foreign cybercrime activities, their impact on the U.S. government, U.S. persons, or U.S. electronic commerce, and the adequacy of the legal, judicial, and law enforcement systems in such countries to combat cybercrime; and (2) multilateral efforts to prevent, investigate, and prosecute cybercrime, including U.S. efforts to encourage such cooperation. Directs the President to give priority for assistance to improve legal, judicial, and enforcement capabilities to countries with low capacities to combat cybercrime. Directs the President to develop an action plan (with legislative, institutional, or enforcement benchmarks) and an annual compliance assessment for each country determined to be a country of cyber concern: (1) from which there is a pattern of cybercrime incidents against the U.S. government, private U.S. entities, or U.S. persons; and (2) whose government is uncooperative with efforts to combat cybercrime. Urges the President to take specified trade, assistance, and financing actions against a country that has not complied with the appropriate benchmarks. Authorizes the President to waive the requirements to develop an action plan or make a determination of cyber concern if in the U.S. national interest. Directs the Secretary of State to designate a high-level Department of State employee to coordinate anti-cybercrime activities. Directs the President to: (1) ensure that there is a federal employee with primary responsibility for cybercrime policy in each country or region significant to U.S. anti-cybercrime efforts, and (2) take into consideration a country's anti-cybercrime efforts before finalizing or modifying any trade agreement with such country. ."
