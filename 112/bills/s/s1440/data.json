    "text": "Prematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers who deliver Infants Early Reauthorization Act or PREEMIE Reauthorization Act - Title I: Prematurity Research Expansion and Education For Mothers Who Deliver Infants Early - (Sec. 101) Amends the Prematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers who deliver Infants Early Act to revise and reauthorize requirements for research on prematurity and preterm births. Authorizes the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to: (1) conduct epidemiological studies (as currently required) on the clinical, biological, social, environmental, genetic, and behavioral factors related to prematurity, as appropriate; (2) conduct activities to improve national data to facilitate tracking preterm births; and (3) continue efforts to prevent preterm birth through the identification of opportunities for prevention and the assessment of their impact. (Sec. 102) Requires the Director of the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth to give preference in awarding grants to an eligible entity that proposes to use the grant funds to develop plans for, or to establish, telehealth networks that provide prenatal care for high-risk pregnancies. Revises and reauthorizes through FY2017 the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct demonstration projects related to preterm births. Includes as activities under such projects programs to test and evaluate various strategies to provide information and education to health care providers and the public on: (1) the core risk factors for preterm labor and delivery, (2) medically indicated deliveries before full term, (3) the importance of preconception and prenatal care, (4) treatments and outcomes for premature infants, (5) meeting the informational needs of families during the stay of an infant in a neonatal intensive care unit, and (6) utilization of evidence-based strategies to prevent birth injuries. Authorizes among such projects as well programs to increase the availability, awareness, and use of pregnancy and post-term information services that provide evidence-based, clinical information through counselors, community outreach efforts, electronic or telephonic communication, or other appropriate means regarding causes associated with prematurity, birth defects, or health risks to a post-term infant. (Sec. 103) Repeals establishment of the Interagency Coordinating Council on Prematurity and Low Birthweight. Authorizes the Secretary to establish the Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality. Directs the Advisory Committee (or an existing advisory committee designated by the Secretary) to develop, and periodically review and revise, a plan for conducting and supporting research, education, and programs on preterm birth through HHS. Requires the Secretary to designate an appropriate agency within HHS to coordinate existing studies and report to the Secretary and Congress on hospital readmissions of preterm infants. Title II: National Pediatric Research Network - (Sec. 201) Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in carrying out the Pediatric Research Initiative, to act through the Director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development to provide for the establishment of a National Pediatric Research Network. Authorizes the Director of NIH to award funding to public or private nonprofit entities for: (1) establishing or strengthening pediatric research consortia; and (2) providing support for such consortia, including to meet unmet pediatric research needs and train researchers in pediatric research techniques. Authorizes the Director of NIH to make awards for not more than eight pediatric research consortia, with a minimum of one pediatric research consortium that prioritizes collaboration with institutions serving rural areas. Authorizes the Director of NIH to make awards for more than eight pediatric research consortia based on a finding of need by the Director, after giving written notice to Congress. Requires such consortia to: (1) be formed from a collaboration of cooperating institutions, (2) be coordinated by a lead institution, (3) agree to disseminate scientific findings rapidly and efficiently, and (4) meet requirements prescribed by the Director of NIH. Allows such support to be for a period of up to five years with additional extensions by the Director of NIH. Requires the Director of NIH to provide for the coordination of activities among the consortia and to require the periodic preparation and submission of reports on their activities. Requires each consortium to provide assistance to the CDC in the establishment or expansion of patient registries and other surveillance systems as appropriate and upon request by the CDC Director. Requires the Director of NIH to ensure that an appropriate number of such awards are awarded to consortia that agree to: (1) focus primarily on pediatric rare diseases or conditions; and (2) conduct or coordinate multi-site clinical trials of therapies for, or approaches to, the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of pediatric rare diseases or conditions. Title III: Children's Hospital GME Support Reauthorization - (Sec. 301) Amends the Public Health Service Act to extend and reauthorize through FY2017 appropriations for payments associated with operating approved graduate medical residency (GME) training programs."
