Prohibits the ITC from recommending any suspension or reduction in duty if: (1) an interested federal agency determines it is not in the U.S. interest and that determination is included in the agency public hearing record; (2) a domestic producer objects to the suspension or reduction, demonstrating that there is domestic production of the article concerned in commercially available quantities; (3) the loss in revenue to the United States from the duty suspension or reduction exceeds $500,000 annually (adjusted for inflation); or (4) the duty suspension or reduction is for more than three years."
