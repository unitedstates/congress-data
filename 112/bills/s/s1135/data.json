    "text": "Energy and Revenue Enrichment Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to contract with a qualified operator for a 24-month pilot program for the reenrichment at an enrichment plant of certain depleted uranium, beginning no later than June 1, 2012. Authorizes the Secretary to sell the reenriched uranium generated under the contract and allocate the proceeds according to a certain scheme. Directs the Secretary to assume title to, and responsibility for, the disposition of depleted uranium so generated. Prohibits the Secretary from selling, each year during the pilot program and the subsequent 24 months after program completion, an amount of uranium exceeding 15% of the U.S. domestic uranium supply. Prohibits the sale of more than 10% of the U.S. domestic uranium supply during any year after such 48-month period, unless such sales will have no significant effect on uranium markets."
