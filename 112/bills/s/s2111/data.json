    "text": "Cyber Crime Protection Security Act - Amends the federal criminal code to make fraud in connection with the unauthorized access of personally identifiable information (in electronic or digital form) a predicate for instituting a prosecution for racketeering. Increases penalties for fraud and related activity in connection with computers. Expands the prohibition against trafficking in passwords to include trafficking through any means by which a protected computer may be accessed without authorization. Imposes criminal penalties for attempts and conspiracies to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers. Modifies criminal and civil forfeiture provisions, including requiring certain civil forfeiture seizures and forfeitures to be performed by persons designated for that purpose by the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) or the Attorney General (DOJ). Prohibits, during and in relation to a felony violation of provisions regarding fraud and related activity in connection with computers, intentionally causing or attempting to cause damage to a critical infrastructure computer if such damage results in (or, in the case of an attempt, would, if completed have resulted in) the substantial impairment of the operation of that computer or of the critical infrastructure associated with the computer. Imposes a prison term of between 3 and 20 years, a fine, or both. Prohibits probation for any person convicted of such a violation. Provides for concurrent sentences under specified circumstances. Excludes from the definition of \"exceeds authorized access\" for purposes of the prohibition against fraudulent use of computers, access in violation of a contractual obligation or agreement, such as an acceptable use policy or terms of service agreement, with an Internet service provider, Internet website, or nongovernment employer, if such violation constitutes the sole basis for determining that access to a protected computer is unauthorized."
