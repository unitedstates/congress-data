Requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to evaluate the amount of federal assistance provided for Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia research at NIH to determine whether funding levels are adequate. Expresses the sense of the Senate that the Director should consider allocating funds and other resources for Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia research."
