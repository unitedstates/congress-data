    "text": "United States Secret Service Retirement Act of 2102 - (Sec. 2) Expresses the sense of the Senate that members of the U.S. Secret Service Division and the U.S. Secret Service Uniformed Division hired between January 1, 1984, and December 31, 1986, were promised that they would be eligible to participate in the District of Columbia Police and Firefighters Retirement System (DCPFRS). (Sec. 3) Amends the Policemen and Fireman's Retirement and Disability Act of the District of Columbia Official Code to allow certain covered employees of the U.S. Secret Service to elect participation in DCPFRS after notifying the Director of the Secret Service and providing certain information and assurances required by the Director. Requires covered employees to make a lump sum payment into a specified appropriations account of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) equal to the cost of transition into DCPFRS. Defines \"covered employee\" for purposes of this Act as an individual who: (1) was appointed during 1984, 1985, or 1986 as a member of the Secret Service Uniformed Division or as a criminal investigator; (2) has actively performed duties other than clerical for 10 or more years directly related to the protection mission of the Secret Service; (3) is serving as an officer or member of the Uniformed Division or is employed by the Secret Service as a criminal investigator, and (4) is covered under the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) as of the enactment of this Act. Requires the Director of the Secret Service to notify each covered employee of eligibility for coverage under the D.C. Fireman's Retirement and Disability Act. Requires notification to such covered employees of the cost of transition from FERS to DCPFRS. Requires the Office of Pay and Retirement Services of the District of Columbia to determine the cost of transition to DCPFRS for each covered employee and authorizes such Office to enter into contracts for carrying out activities under this Act. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 4) Requires a covered employee to forfeit all contributions to the Thrift Savings Fund made by an employing agency prior to the effective date of such employee's election under this Act. (Sec. 5) Makes covered employees who accept employment with another federal agency subject to the same pension offset rules that are applicable to reemployed annuitants under FERS and the Civil Service Retirement System. (Sec. 6) Provides for compliance of the budgetary effects of this Act with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010."
