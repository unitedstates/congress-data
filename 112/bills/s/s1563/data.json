Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to calculate this allowance for the President. Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to redefine \u201cdisaster relief\u201d to conform to the meaning of \u201cdisaster funding\u201d in this Act."
