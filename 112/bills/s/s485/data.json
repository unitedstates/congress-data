    "text": "Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Underwater Preserve Boundary Modification Act - (Sec. 4) Expands the boundaries of the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Underwater Preserve (the Sanctuary) in Lake Huron to encompass the offshore waters of Presque Isle and Alcona Counties, Michigan, and outward to the international border between the United States and Canada, for the purpose of providing the underwater cultural resources of those areas equal protection to that currently afforded to the Sanctuary. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to make minor adjustments to the boundary to facilitate enforcement and clarify the boundary to the public if the resulting boundary is consistent with the purposes of this Act. Requires the resulting area to be managed as part of the National Marine Sanctuary System. (Sec. 5) Sets forth applicable regulations. Directs the Secretary, to the extent practicable, to apply the management plan in effect on the date of enactment of this Act to the added geographic area. (Sec. 6) Prohibits anything in this Act from being construed as increasing, or requiring an increase of, the amount of funds appropriated or authorized for the Sanctuary."
