Amends the Mineral Leasing Act and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to direct the Secretary of the Interior to require a lessee, as a condition of such a lease, to pay an annual fee of $4 per acre on the acres covered by a non-producing lease. Directs the Secretary to issue regulations that: (1) prescribe requirements and benchmarks for diligent oil and gas development to produce oil and gas from each lease to the maximum extent practicable during the primary term of the lease, and (2) require each leaseholder to submit a diligent development plan describing how the lessee will meet such benchmarks."
