Permits only such uses of the Monument that would further the purposes specified above. Allows for continued use of the Monument by Indian tribes for traditional ceremonies and as a source of traditional plants and other materials. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out vegetation management treatments within the Monument, with the exception of timber harvesting which shall only be used when necessary for ecosystem restoration or the control of fire, insects, or diseases. Authorizes the construction of an education and interpretive center to interpret the Monument's scientific and cultural resources for the public. Requires the Secretary to develop a management plan for the Monument."
