Gives Congress the power to enact a mandatory public financing system to provide funds to qualified candidates in federal elections, which shall be the sole source of funds raised or spent with respect to federal elections. Requires Congress to set forth a legal public holiday for the purpose of voting in regularly scheduled general elections for federal office."
