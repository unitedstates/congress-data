Directs the President to submit a balanced budget to Congress annually. Prohibits any bill to increase or decrease revenue from becoming law unless approved by a majority rollcall vote of each chamber. Authorizes waivers of these provisions when a declaration of war is in effect. Requires the appropriate congressional committees to report to their respective chambers implementing legislation to achieve a balanced budget without reducing the disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund to achieve that goal."
