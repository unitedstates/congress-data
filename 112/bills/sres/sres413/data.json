Commends individuals living with autism and their relatives for their sacrifice and dedication in providing for the special needs of autistic individuals. Recognizes: (1) that autism is a major public health crisis; (2) that meeting the needs of autistic individuals is a compelling public policy issue that requires a rapid national response; (3) that individuals and families are desperate to access services that presently are inadequate; (4) the need to begin early intervention services soon after a child has been diagnosed with autism; (5) the importance of assistance in the areas of comprehensive early intervention, health, recreation, job training, employment, housing, transportation, and early, primary, and secondary education; (6) that with access to such assistance and support autistic individuals can live productive lives; (7) that services for transitioning autistic youth and adults are an especially pressing need; and (8) that by providing adequate service and support at crucial points in life, autistic adults can become taxpaying citizens with productive and rewarding lives."
