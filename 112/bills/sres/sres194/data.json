    "text": "Supports the aspirations of the Libyan people for political reform based on democratic and human rights. Commends the service of the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and our coalition partners who are engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people. Supports the limited use of military force by the United States in Libya as part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) mission to enforce U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973, as requested by the Transitional National Council, the Arab League, and the Gulf Cooperation Council. Agrees that the goal of U.S. policy in Libya is to achieve the departure from power of Muammar Qaddafi and his family so that a peaceful transition can begin to a government that ensures freedom, opportunity, and justice for the people of Libya. Affirms that the funds of the Qaddafi regime that have been frozen by the United States should be returned to the Libyan people, and calls for exploring with the Transitional National Council the possibility of using some of such funds to reimburse NATO countries for expenses incurred in Operation Odyssey Dawn and Operation Unified Protector. Calls on the President to: (1) submit to Congress a description of U.S. policy objectives in Libya, and (2) consult regularly with Congress regarding U.S. efforts in Libya."
