Permits waiver or suspension of this rule, or successful appeals from rulings of the Chair, only by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Members of the subcommittee or committee. Makes it out of order in the Senate to proceed to a legislative matter if it was proceeded to in a subcommittee or committee in violation of this rule. Permits waiver or suspension of this rule, or successful appeals from rulings of the Chair, only by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the entire Senate. Amends Rule XVII (Reference to Committees; Motions to Discharge; Report; Hearings Available) to apply the same rule in the Senate before it proceeds to any legislative matter (other than perfecting amendments). States that nothing in this resolution or any amendment made by it shall be interpreted to require or permit the declassification or posting on the Internet of classified information in the Senate's custody. Requires such classified information to be made available to Members in a timely manner as appropriate under existing laws and rules."
