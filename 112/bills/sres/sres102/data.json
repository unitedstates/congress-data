Condemns Muammar Qaddafi for using overwhelming and indiscriminate violence against peaceful demonstrators and civilians, which has resulted in gross human rights abuses, grave loss of innocent life, and potentially crimes against humanity. Welcomes the calls for imposing a no-fly zone in Libya. Reiterates that it is U.S. policy that Colonel Qaddafi must leave power. Calls on the President to: (1) recognize the Libyan Transitional National Council as the sole legitimate governing authority in Libya, (2) implement a no-fly zone in Libya with international support, and (3) implement a strategy to achieve the stated U.S. policy objective of Qaddafi leaving power."
