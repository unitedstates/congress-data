Confirms the alliance's centrality as one of the key pillars of peace, security, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region. Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the United States should use the U.S.-Philippines Bilateral Security Dialogue and the Mutual Defense Board and Security Engagement Board to promote greater alliance cooperation and enhance bilateral security ties; (2) the United States should redouble efforts to expand the economic relationship with the Philippines; (3) the government of the Philippines should continue its efforts to strengthen democratic institutions to fight corruption, curtail politically motivated violence, expand economic opportunity, and tackle internal security challenges; (4) the United States should designate an appropriate U.S. entity to ensure ongoing maintenance of Clark Veterans Cemetery in the Philippines; and (5) the United States should continue efforts to assist the Philippines in the areas of maritime security, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and related communications infrastructure to enable enhanced information-sharing and overall military professionalization."
