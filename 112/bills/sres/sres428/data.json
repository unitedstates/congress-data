Commends the President for the U.S. vote at the U.N. Security Council to condemn the violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by the Syrian authorities. Urges the President to collect information on incidents in Syria that may constitute crimes against humanity and take action to ensure that the government of Syria, its leaders, and senior officials who are responsible for such crimes are brought to account in an appropriately constituted tribunal. Urges the President to formally establish the Atrocities Prevention Board and for the Board to provide recommendations to the President concerning the prevention of mass atrocities in Syria. Urges the international community to review legal processes available to hold officials of the government of Syria, Syrian security forces, and the President of the Syrian Arab Republic accountable for crimes against humanity and violations of human rights. Supports the people of Syria as they seek to exercise universal rights and pursue peaceful democratic change."
