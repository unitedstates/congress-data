Deplores the interruption of constitutional order in Nicaragua that led to the fraudulent reelection of Daniel Ortega on November 6, 2011. Condemns the acts of violence perpetrated on election day and calls upon Nicaraguan authorities to prosecute those responsible. Urges President Obama, Secretary of State Clinton, and Secretary of the Treasury Geithner to take measures to encourage the restoration of constitutional rule in Nicaragua. Notes the issuance of a final report on the Mission of Electoral Accompaniment of the Organization of American States (OAS). Urges: (1) the OAS to issue a report on constitutional irregularities impacting the pre-electoral phase in Nicaragua, and (2) the U.S. Ambassador to the OAS to work with other member states to strengthen the OAS's ability to protect democratic institutions."
