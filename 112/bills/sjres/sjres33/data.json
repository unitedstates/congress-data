Declares that such corporate and other private entities are subject to regulation by the people through the legislative process so long as such regulations are consistent with the powers of Congress and the states and do not limit the freedom of the press. Prohibits such corporate and other private entities from making contributions or expenditures in any election of any candidate for public office or the vote upon any ballot measure submitted to the people. Grants Congress and the states the power to regulate and set limits on all election contributions and expenditures, including a candidate's own spending, and to authorize the establishment of political committees to receive, spend, and publicly disclose the sources of those contributions and expenditures."
