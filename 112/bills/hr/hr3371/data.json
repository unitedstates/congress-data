    "text": "High-Performance Federal Buildings Act of 2011 - Requires federal agency heads involved in the construction of new federal buildings for which estimated construction costs exceed $1 million and are comprised by federal funding of greater than 50% to ensure that the life-cycle cost (i.e., the sum of investment, capital, installation, energy, operating, maintenance, and replacement costs) of such building is considered during its design. Requires the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) to issue regulations establishing federal building commissioning standards modeled on existing private sector standards and guidelines for: (1) the commissioning process generally, (2) the commissioning of individual building systems, and (3) the use of building automation systems. Defines \"commissioning\" as a process for examining and evaluating a building or building system to verify and deliver a building or system that meets the building owner's requirements for use. Requires the Comptroller General (GAO) to study and report on the use of integrated design processes and building information modeling for the design and construction of federal buildings. Establishes the position of the Director of the Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings to assist federal agencies with respect to the utilization of building information modeling, commissioning, and integrated design processes. Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to require reporting on commissioning and energy and water savings measures. Directs the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to establish and update energy and water efficiency standards for federal buildings."
