(Sec. 105) Requires the FAA Administrator to include in the Airway Capital Investment Plan a list of capital projects that are part of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). Subtitle B: Passenger Facility Charges - (Sec. 111) Converts to permanent the pilot program for passenger facility charges (PFCs) at nonhub airports. (Sec. 112) Requires the Comptroller General to study alternative means of collecting PFCs without their being included in the airline ticket price. (Sec. 113) Expresses the sense of Congress that airports should consider the use of qualifications-based selection in carrying out capital improvement projects funded using PFCs.

(Sec. 122) Directs the FAA Administrator to prescribe certain registration, certification, and other specified fees. Subtitle D: Airport Improvement Program Modifications - (Sec. 131) Revises airport improvement program (AIP) requirements. Directs the Secretary to encourage airport sponsors and state and local officials, in the development of their airport master plans, to consider as additional goals passenger convenience, airport ground access, and access to airport facilities. (Sec. 132) Extends the meaning of \"airport development,\" for AIP project grant purposes, to: (1) construction of mobile refueler parking within a fuel farm at a nonprimary airport meeting specified requirements; (2) terminal development; and (3) acquisition and installation of facilities and equipment to provide air conditioning, heating, or electric power from terminal-based, nonexclusive use facilities to aircraft parked at a public use airport.

(Sec. 146) Makes current or former military airports that preserve or enhance minimum airfield infrastructure facilities to support emergency diversionary operations for transoceanic flights eligible for certain discretionary grant funding used to develop current or former such airports. (Sec. 147) Prescribes a special rule that, if the Secretary determines that a contract air traffic control tower already operating under the low activity (Visual Flight Rules) Level I contract program has a benefit-to-cost ratio of less than 1.0, the airport sponsor or state or local government with jurisdiction over the airport shall not be required to pay the portion of the costs that exceeds the benefit for a period of 18 months. Establishes funding levels for FY2012-FY2015 for the air traffic control contract tower program. Increases the federal share of the cost of construction of a nonapproach control tower under the program. Directs the Secretary to establish uniform standards and requirements for safety assessments of air traffic control towers that receive funding under such program.
