Denies a foreign state engaged in such conduct sovereign immunity from the jurisdiction or judgments of U.S. courts in any action brought to enforce this Act. States that no U.S. court shall decline, based on the act of state doctrine, to make a determination on the merits in an action brought under this Act. Authorizes the Attorney General (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to bring an action in U.S. district court to enforce this Act. Amends the federal judicial code to make an exception to the jurisdictional immunity of a foreign state in an action brought under this Act."
