Requires the final decision on an application for a vegetation removal permit to be made no later than 14 days after the application is received. Prohibits a vegetation removal permit from authorizing vegetation removal activities by a private landowner on federal land more than 100 feet beyond the boundary or boundaries shared by such land and the eligible private property. Authorizes the Secretary concerned to make a grant to a recipient of a vegetation removal permit to help cover up to 25% of the vegetation removal costs."
