Requires the card to include, at a minimum, the information contained on the Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty. Directs the Secretary concerned to: (1) establish an application process for a person to request such a card, and (2) make the card available to retired and former members of the Armed Forces who retired or were separated before enactment of this Act. Conditions the issuance of the card upon the payment of an amount sufficient to cover the costs incurred by the United States to manufacture and issue it."
