Authorizes the Secretary to consider a variety of factors in selecting QIO contractors that would provide for the most efficient and effective administration, such as geographic location, size, and prior experience in health care quality improvement. Repeals the requirement that the Secretary provide a QIO with an opportunity to provide performance information before terminating a QIO contract. Requires a QIO to review all ambulatory surgical procedures performed in an area, or, at the Secretary's discretion, a sample of such procedures. Requires a QIO contracting with the Secretary to perform a certain function to perform all specified activities, except to the extent otherwise negotiated with the Secretary pursuant to the contract or except for a function for which the Secretary determines it is not appropriate for the organization to perform, such as a function that could cause a conflict of interest with another function.
