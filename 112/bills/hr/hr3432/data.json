Directs the appropriate Secretary, if a grazing allotment covered by a waived permit or lease is also covered by another permit or lease that is not waived, to reduce the level of commercial livestock grazing on the grazing allotment to reflect such waiver. Deems a permittee or lessee who waives a grazing permit or lease to have waived any claim to all range developments on the associated grazing allotment."
