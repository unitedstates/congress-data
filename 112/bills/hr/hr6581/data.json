Applies Stafford Act provisions regarding community disaster loans to: (1) authorize the President to make loans to state or local governments (currently, limited to local governments) which suffer a substantial loss of tax and other revenues as a result of a major disaster that have demonstrated a need for financial assistance to perform governmental functions; and (2) permit any such loan to exceed $5 million and to be equal to not more than 50% of the annual operating budget of the state or local government in any case in which such government has suffered a loss of 25% or more in tax revenues due to Hurricane Sandy."
