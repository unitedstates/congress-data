Prohibits the Secretary of Education from requiring: (1) those LEAs to serve areas where more than 10% of the property is nontaxable due to the federal government's presence, or (2) other LEAs (those currently eligible for such grants by reason of having a student enrollment at least 40% of which resides on Indian lands) to have a student enrollment more than 40% of which resides on Indian lands before being deemed eligible for such grants."
