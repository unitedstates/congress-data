Revises NIDIS functions to require the NIDIS to, among other things: (1) provide certain information, forecasts, and assessments described in the Act on both national and regional levels; and (2) continue ongoing research activities related to drought. Requires the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere to provide a report to Congress concerning the NIDIS Program. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the Act through FY2017."
