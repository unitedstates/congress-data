Authorizes specified appropriations for FY2012-FY2016, and sets forth a formula for determining the authorization of appropriations for FY2017 and thereafter. Terminates funding for the F-35B and F-35C Joint Strike Fighter Aircraft and the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle. Limits the naval combat forces of the Navy, beginning on October 1, 2013, to no more than 10 operational aircraft carriers and 9 carrier air wings.
