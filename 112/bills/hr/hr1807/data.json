Authorizes the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to sell at least 30 million barrels of petroleum from the SPR and acquire refined petroleum product. Prescribes a schedule for such transactions. Directs the Secretary to deposit the cash proceeds from such sales into the SPR Petroleum Account. Authorizes the President to instruct the Secretary to drawdown and sell or exchange petroleum product from the SPR if a circumstance exists of such significance and scope that action would be warranted to address market manipulation or otherwise be in the public interest."
