    "text": "STEM Network Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award matching grants to state-based STEM networks or similar organizations to increase elementary and secondary school students' achievement in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines, particularly in rural and low-income schools. Includes among grant uses: testing, sharing, and scaling up STEM education research, promising practices, and exemplary programs; identifying state STEM education weaknesses and prioritizing strategies to address them; implementing rigorous common STEM education content standards; developing and implementing innovative STEM assessments; promoting and developing pre- and in-service STEM teacher training; developing STEM career pathways and workforce education and training programs that reflect 21st century workforce needs; and facilitating the implementation of extended STEM learning times on school sites. Requires grantees to conduct periodic independent evaluations of their effectiveness in accomplishing those activities. Prohibits the Secretary from: (1) endorsing or approving any STEM curriculum designed for use in an elementary school, secondary school, or institution of higher education; or (2) requiring a state, local educational agency, or school to adopt a specific STEM program or instructional materials."
