Provides loan limits and requires partial project funding by such small business. Amends the Small Business Act to authorize the Administrator to make up to 20% of the annual amounts available for SBA section 7(a) general small business loans available for loans to veteran-owned small businesses. Directs the Administrator, for purposes of loans or loan guarantees to veteran- or disabled veteran-owned small businesses, to reduce any applicable requirement relating to the veteran's credit score, as long as the veteran has complied with other conditions that the Administrator may require."
