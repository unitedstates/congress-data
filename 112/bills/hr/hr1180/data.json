Requires all distributions from such accounts for payment of business expenses to be completed within five years after the first account distribution. Allows a tax deduction for contributions to a start-up savings account, limited to the lesser of: (1) $10,000, or (2) $150,000 reduced by the aggregate account contributions for all taxable years. Excludes distributions from such accounts from gross income for income tax purposes. Imposes an excise tax on excess contributions to and for nonqualified distributions from such accounts."
