Directs the President, if the Bank has engaged in any of such acts, to: (1) prohibit the opening or maintaining in the United States of a correspondent or payable-through account by a foreign financial institution that has knowingly conducted any financial transaction with the Bank; and (2) freeze and prohibit all property and property interest transactions of such institution if the property and property interests are in the United States, come within the United States, or come within the possession or control of a U.S. person. Applies such provisions to: (1) financial transactions begun on or after the date of the enactment of this Act, and (2) financial transactions for petroleum or petroleum product purchases through the Bank begun 180 days or more after the date of the enactment of this Act."
