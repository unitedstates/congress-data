Provides for a technician's rights of grievance, arbitration, appeal, and review beyond the current stage of the adjutant general of the jurisdiction concerned. Makes a dual status military technician eligible for early retirement if separating from the Selected Reserve or ceasing to hold a specified military grade after: (1) completing 25 years of technician service, or (2) becoming 50 years old and completing 20 years of such service. Increases annual paid employment leave to 30 days for reserve or National Guard duty.
