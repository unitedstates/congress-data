Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1)\u00a0implement an identity theft tax fraud prevention program; and (2) review whether current tax laws and regulations related to the confidentiality and disclosure of tax return information prevent the effective enforcement of federal, state, and local identity theft statutes. Requires the Comptroller General (GAO) to conduct a study and report\u00a0on: (1) the role of prepaid debit cards and commercial tax preparation software in facilitating fraudulent tax returns through identity theft, and (2) the role e-filing and electronic tax returns play in either facilitating or preventing fraudulent tax returns through identity theft. Prohibits the Secretary of Commerce from disclosing information contained\u00a0on the Death Master File relating to a deceased individual to persons who are not certified to access such information. Requires the head of the Federal Bureau of Prisons to submit a detailed plan to Congress on how information obtained from the IRS will be used to reduce prison tax fraud."
