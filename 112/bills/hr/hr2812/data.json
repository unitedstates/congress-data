Defines \"wasted heat to electricity property\" as property comprising a system which generates electricity through the recovery of a qualified wasted heat resource (e.g., exhaust heat or flared gas from any industrial process or waste gas or industrial tail gas, but not a heat resource from a process whose primary purpose is the generation of electricity using a fossil fuel)."
