Authorizes the Director, with respect to any such county, to increase the limitation on the maximum original principal obligation of a mortgage that may be purchased by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) for any size or sizes of residences for a contiguous, reasonably compact set of sub-areas within the county for which the median price exceeds three times the national price. Applies to an entire Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) any such increase in limitation if the county for which the limitation is increased is located in that MSA."
