Requires the fee to be set at an amount that appropriately reflects risk of loss as well as the cost of capital allocated to similar assets held by other fully private regulated financial institutions. Directs the Director to require each GSE to increase its guarantee fee gradually over two years in a manner sufficient to comply with this Act."
