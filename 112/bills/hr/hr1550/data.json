Directs the Attorney General to report annually on the implementation of such requirement. Requires such report to: (1) specify which states and local jurisdictions have a high incidence of homicide or other violent crime; (2) identify the specific steps taken by the Attorney General to implement such requirement with respect to each of those states and local jurisdictions; and (3) provide a description of the methodology used to determine the total number of authorized federal law enforcement positions, to allocate those authorized positions among states and local jurisdictions, and to assign personnel to fill those positions."
