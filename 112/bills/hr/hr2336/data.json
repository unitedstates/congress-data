Requires such study to: (1) determine the designation's effect on existing commercial and recreational activities, the construction and operation of energy production and transmission infrastructure, and the authority of state and local governments to manage those activities; and (2) identify all authorities that will authorize or require the Secretary to influence local land use decisions (such as zoning) or place restrictions on non-federal land if designated under this Act, all authorities that the Secretary may use to condemn property, and all private property located in the area studied pursuant to this Act."
