Instructs the National Credit Union Administration Board (NCUAB) to issue guidelines for extensions of credit made by an insured credit union to a Main Street business in order to promote: (1) appropriate levels of such extensions within the credit union's total lending portfolio, and (2) the credit union's cooperative nature and its safety and soundness."
