    "text": "Claims Licensing Advancement for Interstate Matters Act or CLAIM Act - Authorizes an independent claims adjuster meeting specified requirements to adjust claims for losses related to any disaster occurring in any jurisdiction designated by the President as a major disaster pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, regardless of state licensure requirements governing the major disaster area. Requires an adjuster to: (1) hold a valid license in his or her home state, and (2) have passed any multi-state examination established and administered by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). Urges NAIC to: (1) adopt a certain model independent claims adjuster licensing Act, and (2) develop and administer a multi-state examination for an independent claims adjuster seeking to adjust claims in a jurisdiction other than his or her home state. Sets forth criteria for state compliance with this Act, including reciprocity. Authorizes any independent claims adjuster meeting the requirements of this Act to ascertain, determine, negotiate, or settle a claim in a state that is not in compliance with this Act. Prohibits such a state from imposing additional requirements upon such an adjuster."
