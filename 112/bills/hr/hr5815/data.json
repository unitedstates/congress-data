    "text": "Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 2012 - Amends the Revised Statutes and federal criminal law to prohibit any person, whether acting under color of law or otherwise, from knowingly deceiving any other person regarding: (1) the time, place, or manner of conducting any federal election; or (2) the qualifications for or restrictions on voter eligibility for any such election. Creates a private right of action for any person aggrieved by a violation of such prohibition. Prescribes a criminal penalty for such deceptive acts. Authorizes any person to report to the Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice certain acts of deception involving federal elections. Requires the Assistant Attorney General, within 48 hours after receiving such a report, to investigate it and, if an act of deception occurred, to: (1) undertake all effective measures necessary to provide correct information to voters affected by the deception, and (2) refer the matter to the appropriate federal and state authorities for criminal prosecution. Directs the Attorney General to study the feasibility of providing such corrective information through public service announcements, the emergency alert system, or other forms of public broadcast."
