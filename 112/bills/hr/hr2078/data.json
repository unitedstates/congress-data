    "text": "Homeowners Flood Insurance Awareness Act - Amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to require the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to publicize determinations of proposed flood elevations (including during the 90-day period for appeals) by notifying: (1) a prominent local television and radio station, and (2) each Member of the House of Representatives and each Senator that represents any part of such community. Requires the Administrator to extend the 90-day period for appeals for 90 additional days if an affected community certifies that it: (1) believes there are property owners or lessees in the community who are unaware of such period for appeals, and (2) will use such extension to notify affected property owners or lessees of the period for appeals and the opportunity to appeal the proposed determinations. Allows reimbursement of expenses for the services of surveyors, engineers, or similar services (but not legal services) incurred in effecting a successful petition to dispute the designation of a property as being located in an area with a special flood hazard. Directs the Administrator to: (1) revise annually each flood insurance rate map to permanently remove any property whose owner or lessee (or a community) successfully petitions to remove the designation of such property as being located in an area with a special flood hazard, and (2) ensure that each such map indicates no history of such property being designated as located in a special flood hazard area."
