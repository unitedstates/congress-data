    "text": "Shared Responsibility in Preserving America's Future Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose, in taxable years beginning after 2012 and before 2023,\u00a0an additional 5% tax on individual taxpayers whose modified adjusted gross income exceeds $1 million (adjusted for inflation after 2013). Defines \"modified adjusted gross income\" as adjusted gross income reduced by the excess of: (1) gross income from a trade or business which is not a passive activity and with respect to which wages are paid to at least one full-time equivalent employee, over (2) the tax deductions properly allocable to such income.\u00a0 Makes this additional tax contingent upon the submission and ratification\u00a0of a proposed amendment to the Constitution requiring a balanced budget or limiting spending."
