Declares that nothing in this Act may be construed to: (1) limit any other authority of a public authority, including the authority to offer discounts in transportation tolls to other tollpayers; or (2) affect, alter, or limit the applicability of state or local law with respect to the authority of a public authority to impose toll discounts."
