Prescribes a special rule in the case of any product which bears an official congressional insignia (including a mark resembling an official seal) that is acquired for the use of a legislative branch office. Prohibits the head of such office from making a determination under the Act that it is inconsistent with the public interest to enter into a contract in accordance with the Act. Makes inapplicable to products with an official congressional insignia the exceptions to the Buy American rule for: (1) articles, materials, or supplies not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and of satisfactory quality; or (2) manufactured articles, materials, or supplies procured under any contract the award value of which is less than or equal to the micro-purchase threshold. (Thus applies the Buy American rule to any legislative branch office purchase of products with an official congressional insignia, without exception.)"
