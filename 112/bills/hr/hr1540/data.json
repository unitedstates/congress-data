Subtitle D: Air Force Programs - (Sec. 131) Directs the Secretary of the Air Force, as of October 1, 2011, to maintain a total inventory of strategic airlift aircraft of not less than 301. (Sec. 132) Prohibits this Act's funds from being obligated or expended to retire any B-1 bomber aircraft before the date on which the Secretary of the Air Force submits to the defense and appropriations committee a plan for retiring such aircraft. Authorizes such Secretary, after such date, to retire more than six of such aircraft through FY2016. (Sec. 133) Prohibits the Secretary of the Air Force from taking any action to prevent maintaining the U-2 aircraft fleet in its current configuration and capability beyond FY2016 until: (1) the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (Under Secretary) certifies to the defense, appropriations, and intelligence committees that the operating and sustainment costs for the Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle are less than comparable costs for the U-2 on a flight-hour basis; and (2) the Chairman of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) certifies to such committees that the capability to be fielded before or at the same time of U-2 aircraft retirement would result in equal or greater capability available to the commanders of the combatant commands.

(Sec. 136) Authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to procure two advanced extremely high frequency satellites through a fixed-price contract. Allows such Secretary to use incremental funding for up to six fiscal years in connection with the procurement. Makes such procurement subject to the availability of appropriations. Prohibits the total procurement amount, after certain exclusions, from exceeding $3.1 billion. Allows such Secretary to adjust such limitation by specified amounts, including increases or decreases after FY2011 attributable to inflation or to compliance with changes in federal, state, and local laws. Requires such Secretary to notify the defense and appropriations committees of any such adjustment. Allows such Secretary to use funds currently available for high frequency satellite space vehicle number 5 for the procurement of parts and the replacement of parts for space vehicle number 6. Requires such Secretary to report to such committees on the fixed-price contract. Expresses the sense of Congress that such Secretary should not enter into such a contract until determining that it will save the Air Force at least 20% over procuring two satellites separately. Subtitle E: Joint and Multiservice Matters - (Sec. 141) Limits the FY2012 obligation of funds for the joint tactical radio system to 70% until the Secretary of the Army makes a specified certification to the defense and appropriations committees relating to its acquisition strategy.

(Sec. 142) Limits the FY2012 obligation of funds for the procurement of fixed-wing, non-standard aviation aircraft in support of the aviation foreign internal defense program to 50% until the Commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command reports to the defense and appropriations committees on such program. (Sec. 143) Directs the Secretary, in entering into a contract for the sixth and all subsequent low-rate initial production contract lots for the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter aircraft, to ensure that the contract: (1) is a fixed-price contract, and (2) requires the contractor to assume full responsibility for contract costs above the target cost. (Sec. 144) Prohibits the Commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command from making any milestone B acquisition decisions with respect to certain elements of the undersea mobility acquisition program until 30 days after the Under Secretary: (1) conducts an assessment and determination of whether to treat the element as a major defense acquisition program, and (2) reports assessment and determination results to the defense and appropriations committees. (Sec. 145) Amends the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (Skelton Act) to include in quarterly reports on the use of combat mission requirement funds a table setting forth the requirements approved during the fiscal year in which the report is submitted and the two preceding fiscal years, as well as a statement of any unspent funds for such period. (Sec. 146) Directs the Air Force Audit Agency to submit to the defense and appropriations committees the results of a financial audit of funds previously authorized and appropriated for the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System aircraft re-engining program. (Sec. 147) Authorizes the Secretary to transfer to the United Kingdom an F-35 Lightning II aircraft in the carrier variant configuration in exchange for such an aircraft in the short take-off and vertical landing configuration. Provides: (1) funding for the aircraft to be exchanged by the United States, and (2) exchange implementation through a memorandum of understanding. (Sec. 148) Requires the Secretary to report to the defense and appropriations committees on the development of the short take-off, vertical landing variant of the Joint Strike Fighter. (Sec. 149) Requires the Under Secretary, at the same time as submission of the FY2013 budget, to report to the defense committees on DOD plans to implement the requirements of the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 within the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft program. Title II: Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation - Subtitle A: Authorization of Appropriations - (Sec. 201) Authorizes appropriations for FY2012 for DOD for research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E), in amounts specified in the funding table. Subtitle B: Program Requirements, Restrictions, and Limitations - (Sec. 211) Limits the FY2012 obligation of funds for the ground combat vehicle program to 80% until the Secretary of the Army submits to the defense and appropriations committees an updated analysis of alternatives to such vehicle, and related information. (Sec. 212) Prohibits the individual carbine program from receiving Milestone C approval until the Secretary of the Army submits to the defense and appropriations committees a business case assessment of such program. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to waive such prohibition in the national security interest. (Sec. 213) Limits to 75% the availability of funds earmarked for the Navy's future unmanned carrier-based strike system until 60 days after: (1) the JROC Chairman makes certain system certifications to the defense and appropriations committees; (2) the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition reports to such committees on the system's threshold, performance parameters, and requirements; and (3) the Under Secretary makes certain certifications to such committees on system alternatives and acquisition strategy. Requires the CG to brief such committees on such acquisition strategy. (Sec. 214) Prohibits the FY2012 obligation or expenditure of funds for specified Navy amphibious vehicles until the Secretary of the Navy certifies the requirements of such vehicles based on the needs of the combatant commanders. Prohibits Milestone B approval for the Marine personnel carrier until 30 days after the receipt of such certification. Directs such Secretary to conduct an analysis of alternatives to such vehicle, and to submit to the defense and appropriations committees a habitability assessment with respect to time spent in such vehicles. (Sec. 215) Prohibits the obligation of more than 80% of the research and development funds for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program until the Secretary certifies to the defense and appropriations committees that the acquisition strategy for such aircraft includes a plan for achieving competition throughout operation and sustainment. (Sec. 216) Prohibits the obligation or expenditure of more than 40% of the funds earmarked for Increment 2 of the B-2 bomber aircraft extremely high frequency satellite communications program until 15 days after the Secretary of the Air Force submits to the defense and appropriations committees a program certification and a plan setting forth the projected cost and schedule for certain RDT&E under the program. (Sec. 217) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) improvements to the U.S. space situational awareness and space command and control capabilities are necessary; and (2) the traditional defense acquisition process is not optimal for developing the architecture and environment planned for the Joint Space Operations Center management system. Prohibits the use of FY2012 funds for release one of such system until the Secretary of the Air Force and the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (Under Secretary) jointly submit to the defense and appropriations committees the acquisition strategy for such system. (Sec. 218) Limits the FY2012 obligation of funds for the wireless innovation fund within the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to 10% until the Under Secretary reports to the defense and appropriations committees on how such funds will be managed and executed. (Sec. 219) Prohibits the Secretary from delegating to an individual outside the Office of the Secretary of Defense the authority regarding the programming or budgeting of certain DOD research and educational programs and activities that is currently carried out by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. (Sec. 220) Directs the Secretary to designate the development and procurement of the main propulsion turbomachinery of the next-generation long-range strike bomber aircraft as a major subprogram of such aircraft's major defense acquisition program. Requires the Secretary of the Air Force to develop an acquisition strategy for such subprogram. (Sec. 221) Directs the Secretary to designate the electromagnetic aircraft launch development and procurement program as a major subprogram of the CVN-78 Ford-class aircraft carrier major defense acquisition program. Allows the Secretary to cease such designation upon the program's successful completion of operational testing. (Sec. 222) Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to conduct a program for flight research and demonstration of advanced rotorcraft technology. Outlines program elements, goals, and objectives. Requires such Secretary, in awarding a contract under such program, to use full and open competitive procedures. (Sec. 223) Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop a plan for the disposition of property that was acquired under the F136 propulsion system development contract, and (2) report to the defense and appropriations committees on such plan. Prohibits the use of any FY2012 RDT&E funds for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program until 30 days after the receipt of such report. Subtitle C: Missile Defense Programs - (Sec. 231) Requires the Director of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to: (1) establish and maintain an acquisition baseline for each program element of the ballistic missile defense (BMD) system, as well as each designated major subprogram of such elements; and (2) establish such baselines before the element or subprogram enters engineering and manufacturing development, and production and deployment. Prohibits (with exceptions) the Director from adjusting or revising an established baseline. Outlines baseline elements required for such elements or subprograms, and requires the Director to report annually to the defense and appropriations committees on the baselines.
