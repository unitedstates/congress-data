Applies such coverage requirements to the TRICARE program (military health care). Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), the Public Health Service Act, and the Internal Revenue Code to require health plans to provide coverage of such food, vitamins, and amino acids. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to determine the minimum yearly coverage for all health insurance plans based upon the expanded coverage provided by this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to establish age-specific minimum levels of coverage. Declares that the minimum yearly coverage determined by the Secretary shall not preempt any state standards that require a higher minimum yearly coverage level for the same services and benefits."
