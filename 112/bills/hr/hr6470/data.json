Requires the Comptroller General to submit a report to Congress on activities carried out by the Wildlife Services program of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service that: (1) identifies activities that can be carried out by private sector entities, (2) prioritizes those vital to the protection of public health and safety and agricultural production and that can be performed by such entities, and (3) recommends ways to avoid duplication by the Wildlife Services program and the private sector."
