Prohibits anything in this Act from: (1) establishing or authorizing the establishment of a protective perimeter or buffer zone around the boundaries of the river segments; or (2) prohibiting an activity from being conducted outside those boundaries, including an activity that can be seen or heard. Bars the inclusion of private or non-federal public property within the boundaries of the river segments unless the property owner has consented in writing to having such property included. Renames the Squaw Creek in Oregon as Wychus Creek. Makes technical corrections to the description of the Creek."
