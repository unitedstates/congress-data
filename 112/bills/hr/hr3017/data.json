Sets forth grounds for termination of blue card status, including: (1) deportability, and (2) commission or conviction of certain crimes. Provides for adjustment of blue card status to permanent resident status based upon completed periods of agricultural employment. Exempts an alien from certain Social Security-related violations if committed prior to receiving blue card status. Amends the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to require farm labor contractors to participate in the E-verify Program. Amends the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act to prohibit farm labor contractors from hiring an alien who is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence or who has not been otherwise authorized by the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to work. Establishes a trust fund for agricultural labor market reform."
