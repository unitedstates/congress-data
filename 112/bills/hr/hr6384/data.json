Increases the 30% energy tax credit for investment in fuel cell property to: (1) 50% for fuel cell property used in a combined heat and power system having an energy efficiency percentage of 70% or more, and (2) 40% for fuel cell property having an energy efficiency percentage of at least 60% but less than 70%."
