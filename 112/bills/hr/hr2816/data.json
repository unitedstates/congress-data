    "text": "Promoting Health as Youth Skills In Classrooms And Life Act - Amends the Department of Education Organization Act to establish an Office of Safe and Healthy Students in the Department of Education to assume the responsibilities of the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools and expand such responsibilities to broader health and physical education issues. Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to include health education and physical education in the definition of \"core academic subjects.\" Requires each state to determine the most feasible measure for assessing students in health education and physical education, including through adaptive assessments, to measure student knowledge and performance against state standards. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award grants to, and enter into contracts with, local educational agencies (LEAs), community-based organizations, and nonprofit organizations to initiate, expand, and improve health education programs for students in kindergarten through grade 12, especially in rural areas. Authorizes appropriations for FY2012-FY2016 for the Carol M. White Physical Education Program, which provides matching grants to LEAs and community-based organizations to initiate, expand, and improve physical education programs (including after-school programs) for students in kindergarten through grade 12."
