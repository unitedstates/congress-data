Requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to apply such requirement to judicial branch employees. Allows exceptions for reasons of national security or reasons relating to the public health or safety, including effective law enforcement. Limits the aggregate amount which may be appropriated or otherwise made available for FY2012 for allowances and expenses (including salaries) of any legislative branch office, except the U.S. Capitol Police, to 96% of the aggregate amount appropriated or otherwise made available for FY2011 for such allowances and expenses."
