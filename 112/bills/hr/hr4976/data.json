Bars a conveyed eligible parcel from exceeding 160 acres unless the Director or Regional Forester concerned approves a request for additional acreage. Permits acquisition by a person of only one eligible parcel a year, subject to an exception. Instructs the Director or Regional Forester concerned, as consideration for the sale of an eligible parcel, to require a cash payment in an amount equal to not less than the fair market value of such parcel, including the mineral estate, being conveyed. Requires the Director or the Regional Forester concerned to: (1) pay 50% of the consideration received for the sale of an eligible parcel to the county government in which such parcel is located, and (2) deposit the remaining amount in the general Treasury fund. Requires the purchaser of an eligible federal lands parcel under this Act to cover the costs to be incurred, or to reimburse the Director or Regional Forester concerned for the costs incurred, in carrying out the conveyance."
