Directs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to make publicly available on the Internet: (1) the coordinator's name and contact information and information regarding application procedures and deadlines for the program, and (2) links to the websites where such information is displayed. Requires OPM to establish a centralized electronic database that contains the names, contact information, and relevant skills of individuals who have completed or are nearing completion of an internship program and are currently seeking full-time federal employment. Requires the agency operating an internship program to conduct an exit interview, and administer a survey, with each intern who completes the program."
