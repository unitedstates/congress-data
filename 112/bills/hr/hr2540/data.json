Requires the AG to: (1) appoint individuals to a Voter Hotline Task Force, giving special consideration to individuals representing civil rights organizations, for ongoing analysis and assessment of the telephone service's operation; and (2) submit a report to Congress each odd-numbered year concerning voter intimidation or suppression reports made to the hotline and assessing the availability of the service to all U.S. households with telephone service."
