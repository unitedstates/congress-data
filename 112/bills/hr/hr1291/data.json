Applies that Act to all federally recognized Indian tribes, regardless of when any tribe became recognized. (This effectively overrules the Supreme Court's decision in Carcieri v. Salazar, which held that the Secretary could not take land into trust for a specified tribe because that tribe had not been under federal jurisdiction when the Act was enacted.)"
