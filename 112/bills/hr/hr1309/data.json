    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "2011-07-12", 
    "text": "Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2011 - (Sec. 2) Amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (NFIA) to extend through FY2016 the financing for National Flood Insurance Program (Program). (Sec. 3) Amends the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (FDPA) to authorize the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to suspend temporarily the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirement for areas designated as having special flood hazards, if they meet certain eligibility requirements. Authorizes the Administrator, upon request of the relevant local government authority, to extend such suspension period for an additional 12 months if the Administrator finds that more than adequate progress has been made on the construction of a flood protection system for the area. Excludes from such extension certain improved real estate or mobile home properties with new mortgages. Revises the requirement that the lender or servicer of a loan, in the case of a borrower who has failed to purchase flood insurance, purchase it on the borrower's behalf and charge the borrower for the cost of the premiums and fees incurred. Includes among such premiums or fees those incurred for coverage beginning on the date on which flood insurance coverage either lapsed or did not provide a sufficient coverage amount. Requires a lender or servicer who receives confirmation of a borrower's existing flood insurance coverage to terminate force-placed insurance and refund to the borrower all force-placed insurance premiums (including related fees). Requires each federal entity for lending regulation to direct regulated lending institutions to accept private flood insurance if it meets federal flood insurance requirements. Requires each federal agency lender, as well as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), to accept private flood insurance as satisfaction of the flood insurance purchase requirement if it meets such requirements. (Sec. 4) Amends NFIA to prescribe minimum annual flood insurance deductibles of $2,000 for subsidized rate properties and of $1,000 for actuarial rate properties. Revises the requirement that additional flood insurance in excess of specified limits be made available to any residential building for which the risk premium is determined in accordance with certain requirements so as to enable the insured or insurance applicant to receive coverage up to an aggregate liability of $250,000. Specifies that such additional flood insurance be made available only to a residential building designed for the occupancy of from one to four families. Applies the $250,000 aggregate flood insurance liability to any single building of that description. Makes technical revisions to analogous requirements for additional flood insurance in the case of any nonresidential building, including a church. Sets forth a formula for indexing maximum coverage limits. Prescribes optional coverage of up to: (1) $5,000 aggregate liability for any necessary increases in living expenses for loss of use of a personal residence, and (2) $20,000 for business interruption with regard to any commercial property or other residential property, including multifamily rental property. Requires flood insurance regulations to allow payment of flood insurance premiums in installments, at increased chargeable premium rates and surcharges. Specifies the coverage of a new flood insurance policy on properties affected by floods in progress during the 30-day waiting period before the policy's effective date. Covers damage to the property resulting from such a flood that occurs after expiration of the waiting period, but only if the property has not suffered damage or loss as a result of that flood before expiration of the period.(Sec. 5) Raises from 10% to 20% of the average of the risk premium rates for the properties concerned the annual limitation on premium increases. Schedules a 5-year phase-in of chargeable risk premium rates, in annual 20% increments, for flood insurance coverage for an area that has been upgraded to a special flood hazard area (newly mapped risk premium rate area). Specifies a different 5-year phase-in period for a risk premium in the case of preferred risk rate areas. Limits to the applicable estimated risk premium (actuarial) rate for an area the chargeable rate for: (1) any nonresidential (commercial) property, (2) second homes and vacation homes, (3) single-family properties (built or improved before the end of 1974) sold to new owners, (4) property sustaining over 50% flood damage or over 30% improvement after enactment of this Act, and (5) any severe repetitive loss property. Prohibits extension of subsidized rates for policies lapsed as a result of the policy holder's deliberate choice. Makes communities making adequate progress at reconstruction or improvement to 100-year frequency flood protection systems eligible for premium flood insurance rates that would apply if the reconstruction or improvement were completed. Revises requirements for special flood hazard rates for a community in the process of restoring flood protection afforded by a system previously accredited as providing 100-year frequency flood protection but no longer does so. Requires application of such rates without respect to the level of federal investment or participation in the restoration effort. Allows nonfederal, including private, entities that own, operate, maintain, or repair flood protection systems (instead of a federal agency) to determine whether a flood protection system is restorable. (Sec. 6) Establishes the Technical Mapping Advisory Council, chaired by the Administrator, to develop new mapping standards for 100-year flood insurance rate maps. Requires the Administrator to ensure that Council membership has a balance of federal, state, local, and private members, including representatives from the states with coastline on the Gulf of Mexico and other states containing areas identified by the Administrator of FEMA as at high-risk for flooding or special flood hazard areas. Terminates the Council after five years. Prohibits the Administrator, until the Council submits proposed new mapping standards, from making effective any new or updated rate maps for flood insurance coverage under the Program that were not in effect as of enactment of this Act, or otherwise revising, updating, or changing the flood insurance rate maps in effect as of such date. Authorizes the Administrator, however, to modify flood insurance rate maps in effect during such moratorium, but only pursuant to a letter of map change. (Sec. 7) Instructs the Administrator to: (1) establish new rate maps based upon the Council's standards and recommendations, and (2) update flood insurance rate maps accordingly. Exempts from mandatory flood insurance purchase and compliance requirements property located in a special flood hazard area if the property owner submits an elevation certificate showing that the lowest level of the primary residence on such property is at least three feet higher than the elevation of the 100-year floodplain. Prohibits the Administrator from: (1) charging a fee for reviewing the flood hazard data; or (2) issuing flood insurance maps, or making effective updated flood insurance maps, that omit or disregard the actual protection afforded by an existing levee, floodwall, pump, or other flood protection feature, regardless of its accreditation status. (Sec. 9) Requires the Administrator and the Comptroller General each to study options, methods, and strategies for privatizing the Program. Authorizes the Administrator to implement appropriate private risk-management initiatives to determine the capacity of private insurers, reinsurers, and financial markets to assist communities, on a voluntary basis only, in managing the full range of financial risks associated with flooding. Requires the Administrator to assess private sector response to a request for proposals to assume a portion of the Program's insurance risk. Authorizes the Administrator to secure flood reinsurance coverage from private market insurance, reinsurance, and capital market sources, including through an industry flood insurance pool, at reasonable and appropriate rates sufficient to maintain the ability of the Program to pay claims, minimizing the likelihood that the Program will utilize its borrowing authority. Requires the Administrator to assess annually the Program's claims-paying ability, including its utilization of private sector reinsurance and reinsurance equivalents, with and without reliance on FEMA borrowing authority. (Sec. 10) Instructs the Administrator to report annually to Congress on the financial status of the Program and of the National Flood Insurance Fund, including current and projected levels of claims, premium receipts, expenses, and borrowing under the Program. (Sec. 11) Modifies the mitigation assistance grant program for: (1) states and communities to cover mitigation activities that reduce flood damage to severe repetitive loss structures, and (2) property owners in the form of direct grants to implement mitigation activities that reduce flood damage to individual structures for which two or more claim payments for losses have been made under flood insurance coverage if the Administrator determines that neither the relevant state or community has the capacity to manage such grants. Repeals authority for planning assistance grants. Changes from flood risk mitigation to multi-hazard risk mitigation the plan a state or community is required to develop to be eligible for mitigation assistance. Requires the plan to examine reduction of losses rather than provide protection against them. Directs the Administrator give priority to funding activities that will result in the greatest savings to the National Flood Insurance Fund (NFI Fund), including repetitive and severe repetitive loss structures. Removes beach nourishment from the list of eligible mitigation activities. Adds to the list activities for: (1) elevation, relocation, and floodproofing of utilities (including equipment that serve structures); (2) development or update of state, local, or Indian tribal mitigation plans; and (3) personnel costs for state staff that provide technical assistance to communities to identify eligible activities, develop grant applications, and implement grants.
