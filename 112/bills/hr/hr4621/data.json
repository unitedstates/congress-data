    "text": "United States-Brazil Ethanol Open Market Agreements Act - Authorizes the President to enter into negotiations with Brazil to conclude an agreement that achieves the following trade negotiating objectives: (1) open and reciprocal market access for trade in ethanol products between the United States and Brazil; (2) elimination of barriers and distortions imposed by the Government of Brazil or its state governments on trade in ethanol and that decrease market opportunities for U.S. ethanol exports to Brazil; (3) a stable market for U.S. ethanol exports to Brazil by obtaining a binding, enforceable agreement with appropriate dispute settlement procedures; and (4) energy independence and regional stability by preserving existing Caribbean trade preference programs that strengthen the integrated hemispheric ethanol supply chain among Brazil, the Caribbean nations, and the United States. Amends the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to extend the additional duty on ethanol through January 1, 2015. Authorizes the President to proclaim the suspension of the extension of this additional duty on ethanol beginning on the date the President certifies to Congress that the United States has obtained an enforceable agreement with Brazil that eliminates all tariffs and nontariff barriers on imported U.S. ethanol, including binding Brazil's tariff rate on U.S. ethanol imports at an effective rate of zero. Prescribes a procedure for congressional disapproval by joint resolution of such a certification."
