Requires those schools to supplement that job placement information by indicating whether or not the jobs their graduates obtain are paid jobs or require any postsecondary education. Requires those schools to include on their website, and the Secretary to include on the College Navigator website, a link to the appropriate section of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) website that provides information from the Occupational Employment Statistics program and the Occupational Outlook Handbook of the BLS."
