    "text": "Pine Forest Range Recreation Enhancement Act of 2011- Designates specified federal land managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in Humboldt County, Nevada, and to be known as the Pine Forest Range Wilderness, as wilderness and as a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System (NWPS). Sets forth provisions for the management of such land, including regarding livestock grazing, water rights, Native American tribal rights and cultural and religious uses, fish and wildlife management, and climate data collection. Releases BLM land in any part of the Blue Lakes and Alder Creek wilderness study areas not designated as wilderness by this Act from further study for wilderness designation. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to take necessary measures in the wilderness designated by this Act to control fire, insects, and diseases. Authorizes land exchanges involving identified federal and non-federal lands in Humboldt County. Incorporates acquired lands and interests in or adjoining the Pine Forest Range Wilderness Area into and administered as part of such wilderness area."
