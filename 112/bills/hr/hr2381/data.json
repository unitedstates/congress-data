Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT), in conjunction with the states, to carry out programs that encourage: (1) integrated vegetation management practices on roadsides and other transportation rights-of-ways, including reduced mowing; (2) the development of habitat for pollinators through planting of native forbs and grasses; and (3) research and demonstration projects on economic and environmental benefits and best practices for integrated vegetation management, reduced mowing, and planting of native forbs and grasses for pollinator habitat. Authorizes the use of federal funds for the provision of habitat for pollinators that is related to a federally-funded transportation project."
