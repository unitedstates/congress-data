Authorizes the use of funds for\u00a0competitive grants for: (1) training\u00a0and the development of materials and tools\u00a0for making the local permitting process for solar energy systems more standardized, efficient, and less expensive; and (2)\u00a0solar energy system deployment projects or programs to pilot new permitting strategies or processes. Authorizes the use of funds for challenge grants for: (1) solar energy system deployment projects, and (2)\u00a0programs to pilot new permitting strategies or processes. Requires the Secretary\u00a0to rescind grant funds provided to any grant recipient that receives funds based on a commitment to adopt best practices for solar permitting but that is unable to implement the steps necessary to adopt such practices. Makes each eligible entity receiving funds responsible for a matching amount not to exceed 50% of the funds provided."
