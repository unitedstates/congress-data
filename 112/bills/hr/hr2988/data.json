Requires the Secretary of Commerce to: (1) establish a database, to be accessible only to U.S. government personnel, that identifies potential sales opportunities abroad for U.S. manufacturers and service providers that are prepared to export products and services in such areas; (2) develop and implement a system to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of U.S. export promotion activities with respect to clean and efficient energy and environmental products and services; and (3) establish, through the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee, standards for specified actions with respect to the export promotion activities concerning clean and efficient energy and environmental products and services that are engaged in by any federal agency. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to work with the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) to identify countries that receive assistance from IRENA that improve the deployment and adoption of renewable energy in order to promote U.S. exports in clean and efficient energy and environmental products and services to that country."
