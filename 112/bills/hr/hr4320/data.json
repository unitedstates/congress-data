Requires the analysis to evaluate whether the legislation will positively or negatively impact America's economic ability to compete globally compared to member nations of the Group of Twenty, or G-20, which comprise 19 country members and the European Union (EU), accounting for 90% of global gross domestic product (GDP) and 80% of global trade."
