Authorizes such transfer by one or more quitclaim deeds. Authorizes the Agency to lease or sell the Site to a redevelopment company or other lessee or purchaser. Repeals the U.S. reversionary interest in such property. Amends the Code with respect to the municipal fish wharf and market in Southwest D.C. to remove its exclusive character as a fish wharf and market and make it simply a market. Repeals its designation as the sole wharf for the landing of fish and oysters for sale in the District of Columbia. Declares that nothing in this Act or any amendment made by it authorizes the removal, destruction, or obstruction of the Maine Lobsterman Memorial located near Maine Avenue in the District as of the enactment of this Act. Authorizes removal of the Memorial, however, from this location to another one on the Southwest waterfront of Maine Avenue if at the second location there would be a clear, unimpeded pedestrian pathway, and line of sight from the Memorial to the water. Deauthorizes a specified portion of the project for navigation of the Corps of Engineers at Potomac River, Washington Channel, District of Columbia."
