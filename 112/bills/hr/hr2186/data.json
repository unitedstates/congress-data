Requires: (1) the DOD and DHS Secretaries, at least biannually, to meet with the Secretaries of the military departments, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, and senior enlisted members of the Armed Forces to discuss progress on the plan; and (2) the DOD Secretary to coordinate with the National Guard Bureau and states in tracking the National Guard's progress on the plan. Directs the DOD Secretary to include in its annual defense manpower requirements report to Congress a discussion of: (1) the progress on implementing the plan while still being able to prevail in any war, prevent and deter any conflict, defeat any adversary, succeed in wide ranges of contingencies, and preserve and enhance the all-volunteer force; (2) the available pool of qualified candidates for the general officer grades of general and lieutenant general and the flag officer grades of admiral and vice admiral, including an assessment of the qualified racial or ethnic minority and female candidates. Directs the DHS Secretary to submit to Congress a related annual report."
