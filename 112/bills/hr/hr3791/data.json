    "text": "Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to direct the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to promulgate final rules requiring each securities issuer required to file annual reports to: (1) determine the 5 compensation brackets in which its employees reside (where such brackets contain an equal number of employees and range from the 20% of employees with the lowest compensation to the 20% with the highest compensation), and (2) include in the issuer's annual reports the number of minorities and women employed that fall into each of the compensation brackets. Requires such issuers, for purposes of identifying an employee as a minority or woman under this Act, to rely on self-reporting by the employee."
