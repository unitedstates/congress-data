    "text": "Smart Electronics Act - Requires the Secretary of Energy (DOE) and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to submit a report that: (1) assesses the potential for cost-effective integration of smart electronics technologies and capabilities in all products that are reviewed for potential designation as Energy Star products, (2) assesses the growth of consumer electronics utilization and the associated energy consumption, (3) analyzes the potential energy savings and electricity cost savings that could accrue through specific Energy Star program focus on smart electronics, and (4) analyzes and ranks the potential of cost-effective smart electronics technologies. Defines \"smart electronics\" to mean consumer electronics that include measures to reduce energy use and increase energy efficiency, such as: (1) power-factor correction, (2) stand-by power mode, (3) communication with smart grid and in-home and networked energy monitoring equipment, (4) on-demand and variable processing speed semiconductors, (5) off-peak operation and charging, (6) low power switchable modes, and (7) the ability to achieve greater efficiency with multiple functions on semiconductors. Requires the Secretary and the Administrator, to the extent consistent with report findings, to: (1) develop a smart electronics emphasis as part of the implementation of the Energy Star program, and (2) establish within that program a Smart Electronics Registry that provides a voluntary mechanism for electronics manufacturers and sellers to register their smart electronics products. Directs the Secretary and the Administrator to work with: (1) manufacturers to develop testing and verification protocols to ensure that products qualify as smart electronics, and (2) sellers to develop qualification criteria for smart electronics sales location labeling. Permits states to enact smart electronics standards more stringent than protocols and criteria established under this Act."
