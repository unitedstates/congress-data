Directs the Comptroller General to conduct an audit of: (1) state laws and regulations that authorize the issuance of a concealed firearm permit or license to a nonresident, including a description of the permitting or licensing requirements; (2) the number of such valid permits or licenses issued or denied (and the basis for such denials) to nonresidents by each state; and (3) the effectiveness of such state laws and regulations in protecting the public safety."
