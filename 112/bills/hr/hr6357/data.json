Prohibits anyone, including the President, from instructing an employee or an agent of the United States from engaging in, or conspiring to engage in, the extrajudicial killing of a U.S. citizen. Requires the President to submit to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate: (1) a report on the identity of each U.S. citizen that is on the list of the Joint Special Operations Command or the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as a high value individual or a high value target, and (2) a written assurance that no U.S. citizens are being added to such list. Defines \"extrajudicial killing\" to mean a premeditated and intentional use of lethal force against a U.S. citizen, but excludes from such definition the use of force in certain circumstances, including against a U.S. citizen whose guilt has been adjudicated consistent with due process of law, who is directly participating in hostilities in a zone of active armed conflict and the United States is a party to such conflict, or against whom force is required by law enforcement personnel for purposes of self defense, defense of others, or enabling the release of hostages."
