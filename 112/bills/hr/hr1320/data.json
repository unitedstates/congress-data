    "text": "Nuclear Nonproliferation and Cooperation Act of 2011 - Prohibits providing assistance, other than humanitarian assistance, to a country that withdraws from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Directs the United States, with respect to a country that withdraws from the Treaty, to seek the return of: (1) any material, equipment, or components transferred to the country under an agreement for cooperation pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954; and (2) any special fissionable material produced through the use of such material, equipment, or components previously transferred to the country. Directs the United States, by January 31, 2013, and January 31 of each succeeding year, to pay its full assessed contribution to the regular operating budget of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Directs the United States, when considering the provision of assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or the Arms Export Control Act, to consider whether the proposed recipient has in force an Additional Protocol to its safeguards agreement with the IAEA. Prohibits assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the Arms Export Control Act, the Food for Peace Act, the Peace Corps Act, or the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to any country if the Secretary of State (Secretary) determines that the government of the country has repeatedly provided support for acts of proliferation of equipment, technology, or materials to support the design, acquisition, manufacture, or use of weapons of mass destruction. Directs the President to report to Congress regarding the extent to which each country that engages in exports of nuclear material, technology, or equipment for civil purposes requires nuclear nonproliferation conditions for export comparable to those under this Act or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Directs the United States to conduct periodic security inspections of all U.S. nuclear material that has been exported pursuant to a civil nuclear cooperation agreement under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Amends the the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to set forth additional nonproliferation conditions for new peaceful nuclear cooperation agreements. Requires any proposed agreement for cooperation to be: (1) negotiated by the Secretary with the technical assistance and concurrence of the Secretary of Energy (DOE), (2) submitted by the Secretary to the President, and (3) submitted by the President to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. States that: (1) an agreement that meets the applicable requirements may be brought into effect 60 legislative days after submission unless during such period Congress enacts a joint resolution stating that Congress does not favor the agreement; and (2) any modification of an agreement that significantly alters the agreement's terms or is negotiated pursuant to an exempted agreement shall not come into effect until it has been before Congress for 45 legislative days, unless Congress has enacted a joint resolution of disapproval during such 45-day period. Prohibits the President from issuing a license for the export of nuclear material, facilities, components, services, or technology to a country that does not have liability protection for U.S. nuclear suppliers that is equivalent to the protection under the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage."
