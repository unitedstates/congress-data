Prohibits the USPS from closing or consolidating a post office if it would result in a disproportionate, unreasonable, or undue burden on a class of individuals who are elderly, economically disadvantaged, limited in mobility, or without reliable and affordable Internet access. Applies this Act to any post office: (1) determined necessary for closing or consolidation under existing criteria, or (2) included in a proposal to change the nature of postal services on a nationwide or substantially nationwide basis and for which the USPS has requested a related advisory opinion from the Postal Regulatory Commission."
