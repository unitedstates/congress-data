Deems a person a legitimate business if the governor of each state in which such person does business has certified to the Secretary that: (1) the person is a business engaged in activities currently legal under state law, and (2) the state has an interest in exempting such person from mandatory reporting of suspicious transactions. Requires the Secretary to maintain a public website with a list of all persons deemed to be a legitimate business for purposes of this Act."
