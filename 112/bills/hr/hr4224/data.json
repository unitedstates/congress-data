Permits: (1) the tax deduction for medical expenses without the gross income percentage limitation, and (2) physicians a tax credit for providing charity care. Extends continuation coverage under COBRA (health insurance continuation benefits under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985). Amends title II (Federal Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Benefits) of the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a procedure to enroll a Medicare Part A beneficiary in the Medicare Reform Premium Assistance Program to buy private health insurance. Amends Medicare provisions to allow certified medical professionals to assess the nature and extent of an emergency room patient's illness or injury to determine whether an emergency medical condition exists. Amends the Public Health Service Act to allow the sale and purchase of health insurance policies across state lines. Sets forth requirements for and restrictions on such policies."
