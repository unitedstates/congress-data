Sunsets all other current federal election contributions limits as of December 31, 2012. Repeals current restrictions and requirements on independent and coordinated election expenditures by political party committees after the party nominates a candidate. Replaces them with a special rule for direct costs of communications. Subjects to specified limitations the direct costs incurred by a political committee of a political party for a communication made in connection with the campaign of a candidate for federal office only if the communication is controlled by, or made at the direction of, the candidate or an authorized committee of the candidate. Requires each political committee to post mandatory contribution information on its public website: (1) within 7 days after receiving the contribution, or (2) within 2 days if the aggregate contributions of the contributor exceed $10,000."
