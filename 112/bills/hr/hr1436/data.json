    "text": "Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to require as a condition of each license issued for a commercial or industrial nuclear production or utilization facility that, in the case of an unplanned release described in this Act, the licensee notify, within 24 hours after the release, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the governments of the state and county in which the facility is located. Applies this requirement to any unplanned releases of quantities of radionuclides that: (1) exceed allowable limits for normal operation established by the NRC or other applicable federal laws or standards; or (2) do not exceed such limits, but occur more than twice within a two-year period originating from the same source, process, or equipment at the facility. Requires the NRC to: (1) establish on its website a database of all notifications it receives of such unplanned releases, and (2) allow the public to search the database for notifications by licensee."
