    "text": "Great Teaching for Great Schools Act of 2011 - Amends title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to create a new part E (Building School and System Capacity for Effective Teaching). Directs the Secretary of Education to allot funds to states for subgrants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to implement a comprehensive professional learning system in their schools that: (1) fosters collective responsibility for improved student performance; (2) comprises professional learning that primarily occurs several times or hours each week among established teams of teachers, principals, and other instructional staff; and (3) may be supported by activities such as courses, workshops, institutes, networks, and conferences. Requires states to give subgrant priority to LEAs that demonstrate the greatest need for such funds by reason of their serving: (1) a population of children 40% of whom are eligible for free and reduced price meals under the school lunch program; (2) a school identified, under title I of the ESEA, as needing corrective action; and (3) schools having an average graduation rate below 65%. Allows LEA subgrantees to use school improvement funds received under title I of the ESEA for professional learning activities under this Act, which are to be integrated and aligned with their state's school improvement efforts under title I. Requires LEA subgrantees to conduct formal evaluations of their professional learning systems."
