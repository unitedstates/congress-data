Declares that an appropriation and funds made available or authority granted for a project or activity for a fiscal year under this Act shall be at the rate of operations provided for it under the local budget act for the fiscal year. Makes such an appropriation and funds available for the period: (1) beginning with the first day of the fiscal year, and (2) ending with the enactment of the regular District of Columbia appropriation bill for such fiscal year.
