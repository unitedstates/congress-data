Prohibits the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Administrative Officer of the House, respectively, from disbursing to each Member or Delegate the amount of his or her salary for each day that: (1) there is more than a 24-hour lapse in appropriations for any federal agency or department for failure to enact a regular appropriations bill or continuing resolution, or (2) the federal government is unable to make payments or meet obligations because the public debt limit has been reached. Imposes the same restrictions on the President with respect to receiving a disbursement of basic pay during such period."
