Directs the Secretary to provide grants and technical assistance to states to establish a National Education Innovation Corps that connects educators and administrators with evidence-based solutions to the most critical problems of practice in local educational agencies and chronically low-performing schools. Requires the Corps to be composed of: (1) knowledge brokers, who have expertise in education, research, and the implementation of innovations; and (2) practice experts, who have successful teaching experience. Allocates Corps grants among states in proportion to each state's share of school improvement funds under part A of title I of the ESEA."
