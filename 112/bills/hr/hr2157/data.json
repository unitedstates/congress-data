Authorizes the Secretary to accept a cash equalization payment that exceeds 25%. Requires any such payment to be deposited into the Treasury account established under the Sisk Act and made available for the acquisition of land for addition to the System. Prohibits anything in this Act from being construed as granting the Secretary new land exchange authority. States that this Act modifies the use of land exchange authorities already available to the Secretary as of the enactment of this Act."
