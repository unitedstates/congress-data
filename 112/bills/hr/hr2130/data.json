Directs the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board to select a minimum of one index which is a commonly recognized, passively managed index comprised of stocks based on criteria which shall at a minimum include corporate governance, environmental practices, workplace relations and benefits, product safety and impact, international operations and human rights, involvement with repressive regimes, and community relations. Requires that the index's financial track record be comparable to that of the other options available under TSP. Directs that the Fund be invested in a portfolio which shall be designed such that the percentage of the Fund that is invested in each stock is the same as the percentage determined by dividing the aggregate market value of all shares of that stock by the aggregate market value of all shares of all stocks included in such index."
