Amends the Small Business Act to direct the Office of International Trade (Office) to compile and update annually, for small businesses and their partner entities, a document that contains: (1) the tariff schedules of all foreign countries; and (2) for each of the 50 foreign countries to which the highest total value of U.S. goods and services are exported, specified information on the demand for goods and services in that country. Requires the Office to identify and advertise programs and services to small businesses, including federal programs and services, that facilitate the matching of foreign customers to small businesses. Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to increase, from 20% to 30% of the aggregate annual loan authority available to the Export-Import Bank, the amount to be used to finance small business exports. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to increase the proportion and percentage of projects and assistance financed for small businesses by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Provides limitations on duties under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule that apply to certain goods and services imported into the United States for use by small businesses in their regular operations."
