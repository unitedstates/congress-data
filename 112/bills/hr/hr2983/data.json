    "text": "Rebuilding American Roads Act - Deems the Draft Proposed Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2010-2015 issued by the Secretary of the Interior to be approved as a final oil and gas leasing program under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Deems the Secretary to have issued a final environmental impact statement for the Program under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Directs the Secretary to conduct a lease sale in each outer Continental Shelf (OCS) planning area for which there is a commercial interest in purchasing federal oil and gas production leases. Extends from three geographical miles to nine nautical miles a coastal state's allowable seaward boundary. Repeals the moratorium on oil and gas leasing in: (1) any area east of the Military Mission Line in the Gulf of Mexico, (2) any area in the Eastern Planning Area that is within 125 miles of the Florida coastline, and (3) specified areas within the Central Planning Area and within 100 miles of the Florida coastline. Requires\u00a0the Secretary\u00a0to issue a final leasing plan for the Eastern Gulf of Mexico for all areas where there exists commercial interest in purchasing federal oil and gas leases for production. Directs specified sums received from leasing offshore pursuant to this Act to the Inland Waterways Trust Fund and the Highway Trust Fund. Prohibits revenues collected from leases prior to this Act's enactment from being\u00a0affected by this Act. Directs the Secretary to: (1) prepare an inventory of U.S. offshore energy resources; and (2) promulgate regulations concerning the production of oil or gas resources of the OCS, including regulating the installation of surface facilities, mitigating the impact of such facilities on coastal vistas, and allowing onshore facilities to draw upon such resources that are within 10 miles of shore. Requires persons seeking judicial review of any federal action approving specified oil and natural gas activity to file petitions only: (1) in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and (2) after exhausting all available administrative remedies. Sets forth an expedited review period and limits the scope of such review. Gives the President authority to waive requirements relating to the approval of oil and natural gas activity deemed to be important to national interests. Declares the intent of Congress with respect to buying and building American."
