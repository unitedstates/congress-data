    "text": "International Child Support Recovery Improvement Act of 2012 - Amends part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to use the authorities otherwise provided by law to ensure U.S. compliance with any multilateral child support convention to which the United States is a party. Authorizes access to the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS) by an entity designated as a Central Authority for child support enforcement in a foreign reciprocating country or a foreign treaty country (for which the 2007 Family Maintenance Convention is in force) so that foreign reciprocating countries will be notified of the state of residence of individuals sought for support enforcement. Gives the state the option to require individuals applying for services relating to establishment of paternity or child support obligations who reside in a foreign reciprocating country or foreign treaty country to apply for such services with respect to a child through the Central Authority for child support enforcement in the foreign country. Allows the state to accept or reject the application of any individual residing in a foreign country that is not a foreign reciprocating country or a foreign treaty country. Directs the Secretary of HHS to designate: (1) a nonproprietary and interoperable data exchange standard for any category of information required to be reported under SSA title IV part D, and (2) data exchange standards to govern reporting of such data. Increases from 24 to 48 months the length of time information entered into the data base maintained by the National Directory of New Hires shall remain before being deleted. Revises the authority of the Secretary of HHS to provide access to data in each component of the FPLS and to information reported by employers for certain research purposes. Limits such research to any undertaken by a state or federal agency for purposes likely to contribute to achieving the purposes of SSA title IV part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) or in SSA title IV part D. Authorizes the Secretary to provide access also for an evaluation or statistical analysis to assess the effectiveness of a federal program in achieving positive labor market outcomes (including through grant or contract) by specified federal departments and entities. Reverses the current prohibition against personal identifiers in such research to allow them if certain requirements are met."
