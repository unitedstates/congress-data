Directs the Task Force to submit, make publicly available, and disseminate widely a biennial report including: (1) the strategies developed and updated, (2) a description of the Task Force's accomplishments, (3) current national priorities for addressing such risks and any related emerging issues, (4) updates on federal research findings and research needs regarding such risks, (5) information submitted by federal agencies and by stakeholders for inclusion in the report, and (6) recommendations by the Children's Health Protection Advisory Committee."
