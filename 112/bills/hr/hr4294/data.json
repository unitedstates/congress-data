    "text": "Limited End Strength Reduction Act of 2012 - Directs the President, upon determining that a reduction in end strength of the regular Army or Marine Corps (or both) is necessary for any of FY2014-FY2017, to submit to Congress with the budget request for that year a certification that such reduction, should the assumptions of the most recent National Security Strategy prove to be incorrect, will not: (1) undermine the ability of the Armed Forces to meet the requirements of the Strategy, (2) increase U.S. security risks, or (3) compel members of the Armed Forces to endure diminished dwell time and repeated deployments. Prohibits: (1) the Army end strength from being reduced by more than 15,000 during each such year from the end strength of the preceding year; and (2) the Marine Corps end strength from being reduced by more than 5,000 in the same manner. Requires the defense budget for each such year: (1) to include amounts for maintaining an end strength sufficient to comply with current active-duty end strength requirements; and (2) to not rely on any emergency, supplemental, or overseas contingency operations funding."
