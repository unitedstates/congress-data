Permits such conveyance to be made only after specific conveyance requirements have been met, including that the Director has received and approved a development plan that assures that the conveyed land will be developed and operated as a spaceport. Requires the deed of conveyance to provide that all of the property will be used and maintained in perpetuity for the purpose for which it was conveyed."
