Exempts an individual holding a valid transportation security card from a security background check under such standards. Directs the Secretary to determine, on an ongoing basis, whether alternate security background checks conducted by the Secretary are sufficient to meet the requirements of such standards. Allows the owner or operator of a chemical facility subject to such regulations to permit an individual holding a valid transportation security card or who has passed a qualifying alternate security background check to have access to restricted areas or critical assets of such facility without the satisfaction of any other additional requirements imposed by the Secretary."
