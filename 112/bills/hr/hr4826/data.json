Defines such projects as including a coal-fired boiler that reaches an electricity generating efficiency of at least 36%, and operates at a minimum pressure of 3,200 pounds per square inch. Increases from $2.55 billion to $3.8 billion the aggregate amount of credits allowable for qualifying advanced coal projects, and includes within that aggregate amount a maximum $1.25 billion credit amount for supercritical advanced coal-based generation technology projects."
