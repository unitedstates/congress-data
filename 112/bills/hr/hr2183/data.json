Increases from 15% to 25% the limitation on the amount of CDBG assistance that may be used to provide public services (e.g., those concerned with employment, crime prevention, child care, health, drug abuse, education, energy conservation, welfare or recreation needs). Repeals the 25% limitation on such assistance for such use by the city and county of Los Angeles, and by the city of Miami. (Thus subjects them to the same 25% limitation required by this Act)."
