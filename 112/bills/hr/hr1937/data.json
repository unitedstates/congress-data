Requires the EAC to: (1) conduct and publish a survey of each polling place used in an election to determine the percentage of them in compliance with standards under the Americans with Disabilities Act; (2) establish an escrow account for making payments to accredited laboratories for the costs of the testing carried out in connection with the certification, decertification, and recertification of voting system hardware and software; (3) establish a schedule of fees for such testing; and (4) maintain and publish an updated list of all accredited laboratories. Directs the EAC to analyze various factors that affect the costs to state and local governments of administering elections for federal office. Directs the Comptroller General to study the administrative operations of the EAC, including various methods for increasing their efficiency and cost-effectiveness."
