Declares it discriminatory under the ADA to afford such a trainer, when accompanied by a service animal, with any service, facility, privilege, advantage, or accommodation that is unequal to that afforded to other individuals. Defines \"service animal\" as a guide dog, signal dog, or other animal individually trained or being trained to assist a disabled individual and distinguished by wearing a collar, leash, harness, or cape identifying the animal as a service animal in training, regardless of whether such animal has been licensed or certified by a state or local government."
