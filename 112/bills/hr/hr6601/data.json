    "text": "Carcinogen-Free Label Act of 2012 - Directs the head of each federal agency that regulates a covered product to establish a program to permit the labeling of such a product that does not contain any carcinogens as \"Carcinogen-Free.\" Defines a \"covered product\" to mean any product offered for sale that is: (1) regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Agriculture (USDA), or the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC); and (2) intended for individual or residential use. Requires such agency heads to coordinate to develop an easily recognizable label: (1) to be affixed to a covered product to signify that it has been approved for \"Carcinogen-Free\" labeling, and (2) to include a notice stating that \"This product does not contain known or likely carcinogens that increase your risk of cancer.\" Prohibits the introduction or offering for introduction into interstate commerce of a covered product affixed with a \"Carcinogen-Free\" label if: (1) the head of each federal agency that regulates the product has not approved an application for the labeling of the product as \"Carcinogen-Free,\" or (2) the product contains any substance that is not listed in such application. Sets forth requirements regarding: (1) application approval and confidentiality; (2) random testing of covered products, random audits of facilities in which such products are manufactured, and measures to ensure compliance with agency guidance; (3) application fees; and (4) penalties for violations. Requires such agency heads to: (1) issue guidance to prevent the introduction of carcinogens into such product during its manufacture, storage, and transportation; and (2) post on the agency's public website a list of all covered products regulated by that agency that have been approved for labeling as \"Carcinogen-Free.\""
