Directs the Secretary of the Interior to revise and update the study and report on the potential for increasing electric power production capability at federally owned or operated water regulation, storage, and conveyance facilities required by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Requires the study to include: (1) facilities that would result in less than 1 megawatt of capacity; and (2) information regarding the availability and importance of using materials and equipment produced and manufactured in the United States in the facilities referred to in the report. Directs the Secretary to: (1) consult, to the maximum extent practicable, with nonfederal and noncontracting interests in carrying out this study; and (2) carry it out on a nonreimbursable basis."
