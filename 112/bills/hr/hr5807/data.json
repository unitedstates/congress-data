Requires the audit to assess: (1) the ability of each regional office to support federal preparedness, protection, response, recovery, and mitigation capabilities to respond to an act of terrorism, to foster better regional emergency communications capabilities, to oversee the use of funding to promote preparedness and response capabilities, to coordinate with state, local, and tribal governments and emergency response providers on regional priorities, to identify critical gaps in regional capabilities to respond to populations with special needs, to conduct all procurements in a timely and secure manner that prevents waste and fraud, and to engage in employment practices that are transparent, efficient, and ethical; (2) the impact of the delegation of authorities on the Administrator's ability to achieve consistency throughout the regions; (3) the adequacy of oversight by the Administrator of how the regions are executing the delegated authorities and carrying out assigned responsibilities; and (4) the impact of the delegation of authorities on FEMA and specific regions to address Office of Inspector General and Comptroller General (GAO) recommendations in a timely manner."
