(Sec. 220) Directs the Commandant to maintain the schedule and requirements for the total acquisition of 180 boats specified in the approved program of record for the Response Boat-Medium acquisition program in effect on June 1, 2012, until the Commandant submits to Congress the documentation required to justify the acquisition of less than 180 boats. (Sec. 221) Authorizes the Secretary, in each fiscal year and after submitting specified certifications to Congress, to enter into a multiyear contract for the procurement of National Security Cutters and associated government-furnished equipment. Requires the Secretary consider specified criteria to determine whether such a contract results in substantial savings. Prohibits the Commandant from certifying a sixth National Security Cutter as Ready for Operations before the Commandant has: (1) submitted a program execution plan to Congress specifying how the first three National Security Cutters will achieve certain goals following the completion of the Structural Enhancement Drydock Availability of the first two National Security Cutters and detailing increased aerial support coverage, and (2) awarded a design and construction contract for the Offshore Patrol Cutter. (Sec. 222) Directs the Secretary to conduct a business-case analysis for reactivating and extending the service life of the Polar Sea until at least September 30, 2022, to maintain U.S. polar icebreaking capabilities and fulfill the Coast Guard's high-latitude mission needs during the recapitalization of the polar class icebreaker fleet. Prohibits the removal of any part of the Polar Sea until the Secretary submits such analysis to Congress. Requires the Secretary, if it is cost-effective to reactive the Polar Sea compared with other options for providing icebreaking services, to submit to Congress a service life extension plan including a timetable for such reactivation. Authorizes the Commandant, if the Secretary determines that reactivation is not cost-effective, to decommission the Polar Sea. Directs the Commandant, after the Secretary makes such determination, to submit to Congress a bridging strategy for maintaining polar icebreaking services until at least September 30, 2022. Prohibits the Commandant, until September 30, 2022, except with respect to an authorized decommissioning of the Polar Sea, from: (1) transferring, relinquishing ownership, dismantling, or recycling the Polar Sea or Polar Star; (2) changing the current homeport of such vessels; or (3) expending funds to place either vessel in inactive status or taking other specified decommissioning measures. Title III: Shipping and Navigation - (Sec. 301) Amends federal shipping laws that require a determination by the Administrator of the Maritime Administration regarding the non-availability of qualified U.S. flag capacity to meet national defense requirements before the head of an agency responsible for the administration of navigation or vessel-inspection laws is authorized on its own initiative to waive compliance with such laws when it considers it necessary in the interest of national defense. Requires the Administrator, in making such determinations, to: (1) identify any actions that could be taken to enable such flag capacity to meet the national defense requirements, (2) provide notice of each determination to the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the agency for which the determination is made, and (3) publish each determination on DOT's Internet website. Directs the head of each such agency to notify Congress of any waiver requests or issuances.

(Sec. 302) Shields an entity operating a nonfederal vessel traffic information or advisory service pursuant to a written agreement with the Coast Guard, and any pilot acting on behalf of such entity, from liability for damages caused by or related to information, advice, or communication assistance unless the acts or omissions constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct. (Sec. 303) Directs the Commandant to report to Congress on the carriage of survival craft that ensures no part of an individual is immersed in water. (Sec. 304) Requires, before the Secretary may delegate to a foreign classification society the authority to conduct examinations and approve plans for issuing certificates of inspection, compliance, and other documents regarding certain vessels, a determination by the Secretary of State that such society does not provide comparable services in or for a state sponsor of terrorism. Requires the revocation of a delegation if the Secretary of State makes such a determination. (Sec. 305) Directs the Secretary to examine at dockside certain uninspected fishing industry vessels at least once every five years (currently, every two years). Revises certification and compliance requirements based on whether certain vessels were built before or after July 1, 2013 (currently, the applicable date is July 1, 2012). (Sec. 306) Authorizes the Secretary to extend for up to one year a medical certificate issued to an individual holding a license, merchant mariner's document, or certificate of registry if the extension is required to eliminate a backlog in processing applications for medical certificates or in response to a national emergency or natural disaster.

(Sec. 308) Authorizes the Secretary to conduct investigations and inspections regarding the documentation of vessels.

(Sec. 310) Establishes a U.S. Committee on the Marine Transportation System as a federal interagency coordinating committee to assess the adequacy of the marine transportation system, promote integration with other modes of transportation and uses of the marine environment, and coordinate federal policy recommendations.
