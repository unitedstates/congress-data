Prohibits such sanctions' imposition if the transaction was for the sale of food, medicine, or medical devices to Iran. Applies such provisions to: (1) financial transactions begun on or after the date of the enactment of this Act, and (2) financial transactions for petroleum or petroleum product purchases through the Bank begun 180 days or more after the date of the enactment of this Act. Authorizes the President to waive such sanctions for reasons of national security."
