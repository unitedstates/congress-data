Makes the preferred risk rate method premium available for flood insurance coverage of such properties. Directs the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to establish and implement a plan to notify annually residents of areas having special flood hazards regarding the mandatory purchase requirement. Amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to require the Director to: (1) notify the pertinent Members of Congress as well as the affected communities and their state and local governments about any decision to make a floodplain area or flood-risk zone revision, and (2) provide each such community and state and local government with an opportunity to review and propose modifications to a flood insurance map change or revision. Requires the Comptroller General to review the methodology used to issue or revise flood insurance rate maps. Requires the Director to notify a local television and radio station about proposed or published flood elevation determinations. Directs the Administrator of FEMA to report to Congress a plan for repaying within 10 years all unpaid presidentially approved flood insurance program debt."
