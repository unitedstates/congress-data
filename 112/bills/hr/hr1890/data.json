Describes required plan contents. Allows approval by the Administrator only if the applicant has demonstrated adequate technology, organization, resources, and capacity both to contain and to prevent shoreline contamination by a significant proportion of a worst-case spill, and to provide for long-term cleanup and remediation of the marine and coastal environments. Authorizes cancellation of a lease (without compensation) upon failure of the lease holder to submit an exploration plan or development and production plan in accordance with this Act or to implement an approved oil spill containment and cleanup plan."
