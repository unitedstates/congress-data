Includes among the Association's duties to: (1) represent and promote the interests of financial services consumers and negotiate on their behalf, (2) take affirmative measures to encourage membership by low- and moderate-income and minority consumers and disseminate information and advice, (3) monitor the availability and quality of financial services to low- and moderate-income constituencies and the elderly, and (4) develop data to assist financial services consumers in making informed decisions in the marketplace. Gives the Association the right to include inserts in financial services mailings, in paper or by electronic means, that inform customers about the Association and its representation of financial services consumers and solicit information and contributions or membership fees. Requires annual reports to the President and Congress on the Association's activities of the preceding year."
