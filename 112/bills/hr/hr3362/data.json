    "text": "Amtrak Food and Beverage Service Savings Act - Revises the authority of Amtrak to provide food and beverage services on its trains. Allows Amtrak to provide food and beverage service on its trains only if the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) selects a qualified bidder whose bid would result in the lowest cost, or the greatest source of revenue, to Amtrak. (Under current law, Amtrak may provide such services on its trains only if revenues from the services each year at least equal the cost of providing them.) Authorizes the FRA to exempt Amtrak from such requirement if no qualified bidder responds to FRA requests for proposals. Requires the FRA to pay directly to the entity providing food and beverage service on Amtrak trains any portion of Amtrak appropriations necessary to cover a net loss, but only to the extent that it was anticipated in the bid selected."
