Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to provide each qualifying state with a specified quarterly grant for each of FY2013-FY2022. Requires a state to certify that such supplemental food and nutrition assistance will include specified work and benefits use requirements. Authorizes states to: (1) set aside funds to be used during periods of unexpectedly high unemployment or program enrollment, and (2) use up to 30% of funds for other welfare-related programs. Prohibits supplemental food and nutrition assistance from being provided to aliens not residing legally in the United States. Requires annual state audits. Repeals: (1) the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program); (2) the emergency food assistance program; (3) community food projects; (4) the commodity supplemental food program; (5) the senior farmers' market nutrition program; and (6) the fresh fruit and vegetable program."
