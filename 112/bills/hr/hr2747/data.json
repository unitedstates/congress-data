Sets the maximum amount of such loans at: (1) $50 million for any cancer center or comprehensive cancer center designated by the National Cancer Institute, and (2) $100 million for any entity that is a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center and a cancer hospital meeting certain requirements for a subsection (d) hospital. (Generally, a subsection [d] hospital is an acute care hospital, particularly one that receives payments under Medicare's inpatient prospective payment system [IPPS] when providing covered inpatient services to eligible beneficiaries.)"
