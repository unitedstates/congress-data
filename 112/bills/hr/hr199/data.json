Exempts from such prohibition: (1) any action relating to the preparation of a report or the enforcement of a reporting requirement; or (2) any action relating to the provision of technical support at a state's request. Provides that no action taken by the Administrator before the end of such period (including any action before enactment of this Act) shall be considered to make carbon dioxide or methane a pollutant subject to regulation under the CAA for any source other than a new motor vehicle or new motor vehicle engine."
