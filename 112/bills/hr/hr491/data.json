Directs the Secretary of the Interior to transfer administrative jurisdiction over such land to the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) for inclusion in the Forest. Instructs the Secretary of Agriculture to administer any permit or other land use authorization for such transferred land that is still in effect as of the transfer date in accordance with the terms of such permit or authorization. Permits such Secretary, upon the expiration of such a permit or authorization, to reauthorize the use covered by that permit or authorization under the authorities available to the Secretary on such terms and conditions as considered in the public interest. Allows the Secretary of Agriculture to acquire, with the owner's consent, the private land included within the boundaries of the Forest by this Act. Requires any federally owned lands that have already been or hereafter may be acquired for National Forest System purposes within the Forest's boundaries, as modified by this Act, to be managed as lands acquired under the Act of March 1, 1911, commonly known as the Weeks Act, and according to the other laws and regulations that pertain to the System. Withdraws the Crest of Montezuma from: (1) entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; (2) location, entry, and patent under the public land mining laws; and (3) operation of the mineral leasing, geothermal leasing, and mineral materials laws."
