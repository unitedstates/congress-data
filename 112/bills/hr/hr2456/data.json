Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into cooperative agreements with the Commonwealth of Virginia or any other party under which the Secretary may identify, interpret, and provide assistance for the preservation of non-federal properties within the boundary of the Park and the historic area. Encourages the Secretary to explore the feasibility of a partnership agreement with the Fort Monroe Foundation to benefit the preservation and interpretation of resources within the Park. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance and public interpretation of natural, historic, and cultural resources within the historic area, as well as at any sites in close proximity to the Park outside of such area that are related to events or persons associated with Fort Monroe, including encampments and cemeteries of formerly enslaved persons freed at Fort Monroe during the Civil War. Allows the Secretary to provide for the coordination of interpretation between the Park and the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail for any resources within the Park that may relate to the Trail. Directs the Secretary and the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to enter into an interagency agreement for the long-term protection and public interpretation of the Old Point Comfort Lighthouse. Requires the Secretary to complete a management plan for the Park."
