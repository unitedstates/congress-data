Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) increase individual income tax rates for taxpayers whose taxable income exceeds $1 million, and (2) provide for an adjustment in the capital gains tax of taxpayers whose taxable income is subject to the 45% tax bracket. Establishes caps on funding levels for overseas contingency operations and related activities for FY2013-FY2021."
