(Sec. 103) Authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence Community Management Account for FY2011, as well as for full-time personnel for elements within such Account. Title II: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System - (Sec. 201) Authorizes appropriations for FY2011 for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund. Title III: General Intelligence Community Matters - (Sec. 301) Prohibits the authorization of appropriations by this Act from being deemed to constitute authority to conduct any intelligence activity not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of the United States. (Sec. 302) Permits appropriations authorized by this Act for salary, pay, retirement, and other benefits for federal employees to be increased by such additional or supplemental amounts as necessary for increases in such compensation or benefits authorized by law. (Sec. 303) Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to require that officers or employees of the United States or members of the Armed Forces detailed to the staff of an element of the intelligence community (IC) or another element of the U.S. government be so detailed on a non-reimbursable basis only. (Current law allows for such detail on either a reimbursable or non-reimbursable basis.) (Sec. 304) Authorizes the DNI to provide grants to historically black colleges and universities to provide programs of study in: (1) intermediate and advanced foreign languages deemed in the immediate interest of the IC, and (2) study abroad and cultural immersion programs. Title IV: Matters Relating to Elements of the Intelligence Community - Subtitle A: Office of the Director of National Intelligence - (Sec. 401) Requires the National Counterintelligence Strategy to be revised or updated at least every three years and to be aligned with the strategy and policies of the DNI. (Sec. 402) Directs the DNI to establish an initial operating capability for an automated insider threat detection program for information resources in each element of the IC in order to detect unauthorized access to, or the use or transmission of, classified intelligence. Requires: (1) full program operating capability by October 1, 2013; and (2) the DNI to report to the intelligence committees on resources required to implement the program. (Sec. 403) Requires the IC Inspector General to report to Congress on the degree to which U.S. racial and ethnic minorities are employed in IC professional positions, as well as barriers to the recruitment and retention of additional racial and ethnic minorities in such positions. (Sec. 404) Directs the DNI to submit to Congress recommendations for consolidating elements of the IC. Subtitle B: Other Elements - (Sec. 411) Authorizes the DIA Director to expend human intelligence and counterintelligence activities funds made available under the National Intelligence Program for objects of a confidential, extraordinary, or emergency nature, without regard to restrictions on the expenditure of government funds. Prohibits the expenditure of more than 5% of such funds for such purpose in a fiscal year, unless such Director provides 30 days' advance notice to the intelligence committees. Requires such Director to report annually to such committees on such expenditures. Title V: Other Matters - (Sec. 501) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) railway transportation (including subway transit) should be prioritized in the development of IC transportation security plans; and (2) railway transportation security should be included in IC transportation security budgets. Title VI: Honoring the Members of the Intelligence Community for Their Role in the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden on May 1, 2011 - (Sec. 601) Commends the men and women of the IC for: (1) their tremendous commitment, perseverance, professionalism, and sacrifice in bringing Osama bin Laden to justice; and (2) committing themselves to defeating, disrupting, and dismantling al Qaeda. Reaffirms the commitment to using the capabilities and skills of the IC to: (1) disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda and affiliated organizations around the world that threaten U.S. national security; (2) eliminate safe havens for terrorists in Afghanistan and Pakistan; and (3) bring terrorists to justice."
