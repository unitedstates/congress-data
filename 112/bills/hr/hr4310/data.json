Directs the Administrator to ensure that the federal subcontracting reporting system to which such reports are submitted is modified to notify the Administrator, the appropriate contracting officer, and the appropriate Director of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization if an entity fails to submit a required report. Makes such failure a breach of contract for which appropriate action may be taken.

Part VI: Contract Bundling - (Sec. 1671) Consolidates SBA provisions relating to contract bundling (the consolidation of two or more procurement requirements into a solicitation for a single prime contract that is unlikely, because of its size or complexity, to be suitable for award to a small business).

Requires the Administrator, in the case of a previously bundled contract that is to be recompeted as a bundled contract, to determine, among other things, the amount of savings and benefits achieved under the bundling. Requires a procurement center representative who believes that a procurement as proposed will render small business prime contract participation unlikely to recommend to the Activity alternative procurement methods to increase small business contracting opportunities. Requires the head of an agency, before proceeding with an acquisition strategy that could lead to a bundling of contract requirements, to conduct market research to determine whether bundling is necessary and justified. Prohibits an agency head from carrying out an acquisition strategy that includes bundled contracts valued in excess of certain thresholds unless the senior procurement executive for such agency certifies to the agency head that steps will be taken to include small businesses in the acquisition strategy prior to its implementation. Allows a small business, in the case of a bundled contract, to submit an offer that provides for the use of a team of subcontractors for contract performance.

Requires such study results to be submitted to the CG, who shall assess such report and submit assessment results to the defense and appropriations committees.

Allows amounts specified in the funding tables in this Division to be transferred or reprogrammed under a transfer or reprogramming authority provided by another provision of this Act or by other law. Prohibits any oral or written communication concerning an amount specified in the funding tables from superseding the requirements of this section.
