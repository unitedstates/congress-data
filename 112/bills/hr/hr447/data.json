Directs the SBA Administrator to modify SBIR policy directives to provide for an increase to $200,000 in the amount which an agency may award in the first phase of an SBIR program, and to $1.5 million the amount for the second phase, with an adjustment of such amounts once every five years to reflect economic adjustments and programmatic considerations."
