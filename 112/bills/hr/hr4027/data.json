Directs the Secretary of the Interior to reserve an overriding interest in that portion of the mineral estate composed of minerals subject to leasing under the Mineral Leasing Act in the mineral lands conveyed to Utah. Delineates the extent of that interest. Requires Utah to reserve, for the benefit of its school trust, an overriding interest in that portion of the mineral estate composed of minerals subject to leasing under the Mineral Leasing Act in the mineral lands it relinquished to the federal government. Delineates the extent of that interest. Obligates neither the federal government nor Utah to lease or otherwise develop oil and gas resources in which the other party retains an overriding interest under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with Utah and the Tribe to facilitate the relinquishment and selection of the lands to be conveyed, and the administration of the overriding interests reserved under this Act. Terminates the overriding interests reserved by the Secretary and Utah 30 years after this Act's enactment."
