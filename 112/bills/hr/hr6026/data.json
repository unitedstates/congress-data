Requires: (1) all costs of such work to be treated as operation and maintenance costs, including the first costs of achieving a navigation channel of 50 feet; (2) the federal cost share of such work to be 100%; and (3) the Secretary to pay 100% of the costs of such work out of amounts made available from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for operation and maintenance expenses. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on: (1) the cost and the environmental, storm damage reduction, and social benefits of the pump-out disposal operation; and (2) the total quantity of dredge material produced during operation and maintenance activities in the New Orleans District and the quantity that is beneficially used."
