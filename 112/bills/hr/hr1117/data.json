Requires an air ambulance medical service provider licensed in more than one state, if the different state air ambulance medical services regulations are inconsistent, to comply with the most stringent regulation. Requires a state, if necessary, to establish regulations or negotiate mutual aid agreements with adjacent states or air ambulances to ensure access to air ambulance services across state borders."
