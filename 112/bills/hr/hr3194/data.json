Allows agency heads to exempt covered regulations that: (1) are necessary due to an imminent threat to human health or safety or any other emergency; (2) are necessary to enforce criminal laws,\u00a0(3) foster private sector job creation; (4) encourage economic growth; (5) reduce regulatory burdens; (6) pertain to a military or foreign affairs function; or (7) are limited to interpreting, implementing, or administering the Internal Revenue Code."
