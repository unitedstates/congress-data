Includes among such activities: (1) the development of renewable energy technologies for integration with desalination technologies to reduce the capital and operation costs, and minimize the environmental impacts, of desalination and to increase public acceptance of desalination as a viable water supply process; (2) research regarding various desalination processes, including reverse and forward osmosis technologies; (3) the development of innovative methods and technologies to reduce the volume and cost of desalination concentrated wastes in an environmentally sound manner; (4) an outreach program to create partnerships with states, academic institutions, private entities, local public agencies, and other appropriate organizations to conduct research, development, and demonstration activities, including the establishment of rental and other charges to provide revenue to help offset the costs of operating and maintaining the facility; and (5) an outreach program to educate the public on desalination and renewable energy technologies and the benefits of using water in an efficient manner. Directs the Secretary to conduct demonstration projects to: (1) develop new water and energy technologies with widespread applicability; and (2) create new supplies of usable water for municipal, agricultural, industrial, or environmental purposes. Authorizes appropriations through FY2016 to carry out the Water Desalination Act of 1996."
