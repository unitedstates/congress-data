(Sec. 1304) States that nothing shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting the Librarian of Congress from accepting non-personal services and voluntary and uncompensated personal services (as well as, under current law, gifts or bequests of money) for immediate disbursement in the interest of the Library, its collections, or its service. Prescribes reporting requirements for the Librarian regarding such gifts or bequests. (Sec. 1305) Modifies requirements for the use of appropriations to the Library of Congress for the purchase of books and sound-reproduction records for blind and other physically handicapped U.S. residents to change the terminology used to identify such individuals as \"residents or persons with disabilities.\" Limits the lending of such books, recordings, reproducers, musical scores, instructional texts, and other specialized materials by the Library's local or regional centers to blind and other U.S. residents with disabilities (including the several States, Territories, insular possessions, and the District of Columbia). (Sec. 1401) Makes balances of expired GAO appropriations available to GAO for deposit to the credit of the mandatory Employees' Compensation Fund.

(Sec. 207) Authorizes the AOC to maintain and improve the landscape features, excluding streets, in specified grassy areas of Washington, DC, SW. (Sec. 209) Prohibits the use of funds made available to the AOC in this Act to eliminate or restrict guided tours of the U.S. Capitol led by congressional employees and interns. Allows temporary suspension or restriction of such tours for security or related reasons to the same extent as guided tours of the U.S. Capitol led by the AOC. (Sec. 210) Adds to the Capitol Grounds certain property (defined in this Act as Union Square), including any monument or other facility located within such area, which was transferred to AOC jurisdiction and control under title I of division G of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (CAA, 2012). Authorizes the Capitol Police to: (1) issue a permit authorizing a person to engage in commercial activity in Union Square in a manner that does not interfere with Congress; (2) establish and collect permit application fees; and (3) establish and collect other fees for the use of Union Square, all Capitol Police or AOC costs incurred resulting from such use, and costs to monitor the permitted activity. Establishes a Union Square Commercial Account in the Treasury consisting of all such fees, to be made available, without fiscal year limitations or further appropriation, for disbursement by the Capitol Police to defray expenses associated with Union Square and to reimburse the AOC for costs incurred relating to its use. Requires the Capitol Police Board, subject to congressional approval, to promulgate regulations for commercial use of Union Square which shall: (1) describe the types of commercial activity authorized (which shall be substantially similar to the types permitted in Union Square on the day before enactment of CAA, 2012); and (2) provide for payment of fees and costs substantially similar to those collected by the National Park Service (NPS) on the day before such enactment. States that nothing in this Act or in CCA, 2012 shall be be construed to affect any permit for engaging in commercial activity in Union which was issued by the NPS before enactment of CAA, 2012."
