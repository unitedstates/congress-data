Requires the working group to: (1) include equal representation of consumer and industry advocates; (2) promulgate guidance on best practices for pharmacies to ensure that blind and visually impaired individuals have safe, consistent, reliable, and independent access to the information in the labeling of prescription drugs; (3) consider the use of Braille, specified auditory means, and enhanced visual means to provide such access; and (4) consider whether there are technical, financial, manpower, or other factors that may fundamentally impact the ability of pharmacies with 20 or fewer retail locations to implement the best practices. Directs the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (FDA) to conduct an informational and educational program to inform the public and pharmacists about such guidance and practices. Directs the Comptroller General: (1) 18 months after such guidance and practices are published, to review pharmacy compliance and the extent to which access barriers continue; and (2) by September 30, 2016, to report on such review, including recommendations for reducing such barriers."
