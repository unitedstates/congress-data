Allows a person who meets applicable legal requirements to be an importer of prescription drugs upon application to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). Requires the Secretary to approve such an application if the drug meets all FFDCA requirements for admission into the United States, including that the drug has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is not adulterated or misbranded. Prohibits the Secretary from taking any action against any of the persons involved with the interstate sale of a prescription drug through an Internet site if: (1) the sale was made in compliance with FFDCA, the Controlled Substances Act, and applicable state laws; and (2) accurate information regarding compliance with such laws is posted on the Internet site. Makes this Act effective one year after enactment, without regard to whether the Secretary has promulgated regulations."
