Requires the Postal Service to implement a plan to replace or convert, by January 1, 2017, 2,000 gasoline-powered delivery vehicles with electric vehicles manufactured in the United States. Authorizes the Post Service to: (1) borrow money and issue obligations as necessary to carry out such plan or to help finance energy efficiency projects for operations and facilities; and (2) use its capabilities, including its vehicles, to provide services, other than postal services, to generate revenue if providing such service is consistent with the public interest. Requires the Postal Service to submit a plan on the co-location of post offices at retail facilities while ensuring continued service to small communities and rural areas. Allows wine or malt beverages to be mailed by a licensed winery or brewery for direct delivery by the Postal Service to an addressee who is at least 21 years of age. Requires the Postal Service to study and report on: (1) ways to promote the use of transpromotional mailings (from more than one source) and consolidated mailings (from more than one agency), and (2) the costs to executive agencies of sending mail by using the Postal Service compared to other carriers. Authorizes the Postal Service to: (1) enter arrangements whereby the sender may defer payment of postage until the item has been delivered; (2) promote the creation of mailing pools to allow members to take advantage of postage rates applicable to bulk mailings and other discounts; and (3) carry out a pilot program to test an integrated electronic system for the receipt, storage, transport, and delivery of mail directed to physical addresses and post office boxes. Establishes an advocate for competition in the Postal Service and the Postal Regulatory Commission. Requires the Postmaster General and the Commission to issue a policy on contracting officer delegations of authority. Sets forth provisions concerning postal contracts, including requirements for: (1) posting justifications of noncompetitive contracts, and (2) a review of ethical issues relating to proposed contracts. Requires the Postal Service to: (1) publish notice and provide a period for public comment before adding, eliminating, or modifying any mailing rules; and (2) report on implementing special classifications and service agreements in connection with the establishment and operation of a system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products. Requires the Postal Service and the Commission to report on creating a not-for-profit venture capital program to help the Postal Service identify and develop electronic communication products that would increase net revenue."
