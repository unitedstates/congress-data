Requires a 100% federal share of a grant project involving acquisition of clean fuel or alternative fuel vehicle-related equipment or facilities to comply with the Clean Air Act. Amends the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) to direct the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to issue guidance on nationwide implementation of the transit pass transportation fringe benefits program for federal employees. Directs the Secretary to establish a pilot program to carry out vanpool demonstration projects."
