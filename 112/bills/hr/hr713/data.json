Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to revise detention of criminal alien provisions, effective as if included in the Act. Repeals, as if included in the Act: (1) certain provisions respecting termination of continuous presence or physical presence in the United States, and (2) the definition of \"conviction.\" Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to admit certain lawfully admitted permanent resident aliens returning to the United States who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation or removal, effective as of a specified date, as if certain sections of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and the Act had not been enacted. Revises provisions respecting judicial review of removal orders. Requires the Secretary to establish a post-proceeding removal relief process for affected aliens."
