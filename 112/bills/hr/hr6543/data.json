Requires AOA also to coordinate activities with other federal agencies working to improve care coordination and developing new models and best practices. Requires the designated state agency to promote the development and implementation of a state system to: (1) address the care coordination needs of older individuals with multiple chronic illnesses; and (2) work with acute care providers, area agencies on aging, service providers, and federal agencies to ensure that the system uses best practices. Requires area and state plans to provide assurances that the area agencies on aging will facilitate the area-wide development and implementation of an area-wide system to address the care coordination needs of older individuals with multiple chronic illnesses."
