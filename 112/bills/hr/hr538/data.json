Requires each federal agency to: (1) collect information from its customers regarding the quality of its customer services, (2) include this information in its performance report to the President and Congress, and (3) designate an employee as the agency's customer relations representative to be responsible for implementing customer service standards. Provides that employee compliance with agency customer service standards shall be measured in employee performance appraisals. Authorizes the President to exempt an agency from the application of this Act for national security reasons. Requires: (1) any savings or reductions in expenditures resulting from this Act to be used to offset the cost of implementing this Act, and (2) any additional savings to be used to reduce the deficit."
