Requires the FTC, through such office, to establish procedures to: (1) log and acknowledge complaints from individuals who certify that they believe they have been victims of mail, telemarketing, television, or Internet fraud; (2) provide certain information on those kinds of fraud; and (3) refer such complaints to appropriate entities, including state consumer protection agencies and entities and appropriate law enforcement agencies, for potential law enforcement action."
