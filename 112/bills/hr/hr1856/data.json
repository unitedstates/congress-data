Recognizes that the absence of religious freedom is related to the persecution of religious minorities, religious conflict, violence, extremism, and terrorism (including terrorism reaching the United States). Extends U.S. policy to assisting nongovernmental organizations (currently, only governments) promoting religious freedom. Authorizes the Ambassador, subject to the direction of the President and the Secretary of State, to represent the United States in contacts with nongovernmental organizations impacting religious freedom in their respective societies, regions, or internationally. Specifies the minimum training requirements for foreign service officers, including chiefs of mission, under the Foreign Service Act of 1980. Modifies: (1) procedures for appointing members to the Commission on International Religious Freedom, and (2) terms of office for such members. Establishes the Executive Committee of the Commission. Extends the Commission's termination date to September 30, 2018.
