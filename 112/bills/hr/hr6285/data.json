Permits the Secretary to lease the real property to the township until the time such property is conveyed to the township. Requires the township to cover costs (except costs for environmental remediation of the property) to be incurred by the Secretary or to reimburse the Secretary for such costs incurred in carrying out the conveyance, including survey costs, costs for environmental documentation, and any other administrative costs related to the conveyance. Prohibits the township from using federal funds to cover any part of conveyance costs or to cover the costs for the design and construction of any facility on the property. Instructs the township to begin using the property for public purposes before the end of a five-year period beginning on the date of such conveyance."
