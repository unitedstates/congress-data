Restores to the Medicare Trust Funds unobligated amounts that were originally transferred from them for such programs and activities. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to report to Congress on demonstration, pilot, or similar projects undertaken with funding from any of the Medicare Trust Funds, especially those for which the initial period of the project has: (1) not demonstrated that the project has met its objectives, or (2) resulted in net expenditures from the Medicare Trust Funds. Requires the Secretary to include with this report a plan for termination or modification of each such project."
