    "text": "Early Stage Small Business Contracting Act of 2012 - Amends the Small Business Act to direct the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to establish and carry out a program to provide increased access to federal contract opportunities for early stage small businesses (no more than 15 employees and average annual receipts of no more than $1 million). Requires the Administrator to identify appropriate federal procurement contracts for award under the program. Allows a contracting officer to award: (1) a sole source contract under the program if an entity is determined to be a responsible contractor and the officer does not reasonably expect that two or more early stage businesses will submit offers, and (2) contracts on the basis of competition restricted to early stage businesses if the officer reasonably expects that at least two early stage businesses will submit offers and that the award can be made at a fair market price. Requires all program contract awards to be counted toward goals for small business participation in federal procurement contracts."
