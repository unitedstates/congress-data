Directs the officer, upon reasonable grounds to believe the individual is an alien, to: (1) verify the individual's immigration status, and (2) take into custody for federal transfer an individual who is unlawfully in the United States. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to reimburse states and localities for related transportation costs when such transportation is not done in the course of normal duties. Requires a state or locality, in order to qualify for state criminal alien assistance program (SCAAP) funding, to participate by January 1, 2014, in either or both of: (1) the secure communities initiative, or (2) the program under which state officers and employees perform specified immigration functions. Requires the Attorney General to enter into such state immigration enforcement programs. (Current law authorizes such participation.) Requires DHS reimbursement for related state or local training costs."
