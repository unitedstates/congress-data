    "text": "State Compact Health Choice Act of 2011 - Eliminates the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to regulate health care choice compacts, which are agreements between two or more states to allow health plans that comply with one state's laws to be offered in the individual market in all such states. Gives Congress's consent to such compacts. Removes the requirement that a health plan under such a compact be a qualified health plan. Authorizes Congress to revoke consent for such compacts by passing a joint resolution. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exempt an individual covered under a plan subject to such a compact from the requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage."
