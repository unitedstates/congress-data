Extinguishes all claims against the United States, a state or local government, or any other person or entity, by the Band arising subsequent to such cession, and based upon any interest in or right involving the land. Prohibits the Band from using its federal recognition to assert any historical land claim. Transfers all interests in lands held by the Band upon enactment of this Act to the United States, to be held in trust for the benefit of the Band."
