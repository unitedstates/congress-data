Prescribes mortgagor income and employment criteria. Exempts such mortgages from any requirements and guidelines of such government sponsored entities (also known as GSEs) that are inconsistent with such authority. Limits the application of this Act to such mortgages in a high tourism area. Amends the National Housing Act to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to insure any affordable workforce housing mortgage meeting certain requirements. Requires the Secretary of HUD to provide a spot approval process for insurance of condominium unit mortgages that does not require prior approval of the entire project or of the homeowners association for the entire project. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to determine high tourism areas."
