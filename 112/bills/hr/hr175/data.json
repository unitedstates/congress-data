    "text": "Smart Housing in Disasters Act of 2011 - Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) to cover as a major disaster any \"catastrophic incident\" as defined by the Homeland Security Act, namely any natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster that results in extraordinary levels of casualties or damage or disruption severely affecting the population (including mass evacuations), infrastructure, environment, economy, national morale, or government functions in an area. Amends the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 to direct the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to develop, as an annex to the National Disaster Housing Strategy, a lifecycle and tracking plan for housing units provided to individuals and households affected by an emergency or major disaster that establishes policies for procurement, delivery, installation, maintenance, deactivation, and disposal of the units. Requires the plan to: (1) emphasize the acquisition of housing units that can be recycled and reused for multiple emergencies or major disasters; and (2) include a process for the Administrator to track each housing unit from its date of acquisition through its date of disposal. Amends the Stafford Act to direct the President, upon determining that a temporary housing unit purchased under such Act for housing disaster victims is unsuitable for habitation, to alter such unit in a manner that will prevent it from being used for habitation before it is disposed through sale to a recycler or other purchaser."
