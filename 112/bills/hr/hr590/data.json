Requires such redistricting to be conducted according to: (1) a plan developed by the independent redistricting commission established in the state; or (2) if such plan is not enacted into law, the redistricting plan selected by the state's highest court or developed by a U.S. district court. Provides for: (1) establishment by each state of an independent redistricting commission; (2) development by such commission of a redistricting plan; (3) submission of the plan to, and consideration and enactment of a plan by, the state legislature; (4) selection of a plan by the state's highest court or development of a plan by the U.S. district court, under specified conditions; (5) special rules for redistricting conducted under a federal court order; (6) Election Assistance Commission payments to states for carrying out redistricting; (7) civil enforcement to carry out this Act; and (8) the right of civil action for a person who is aggrieved by a violation of this Act."
