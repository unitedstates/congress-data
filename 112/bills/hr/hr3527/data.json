Directs the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to adopt standards distinguishing: (1) the activities of a swap dealer specified in current law, and (2) entering into swaps for a person's own account in order to achieve its own trading objectives as determined by the CFTC. Directs the CFTC to exempt from designation as a swap dealer an entity that enters into swap dealing transactions with or on behalf of its customers if the aggregate gross notional amount of the outstanding swap dealing transactions entered into over the course of the preceding calendar year does not exceed $3 billion (or a greater amount, as market conditions warrant), adjusted for inflation. (Sec. 3) States that this Act shall be implemented: (1) without regard to federal law regarding coordination of federal information policy or rulemaking requirements concerning notice and comment, and (2) through promulgation of an interim final rule."
