Declares that, for section 8 rental assistance eligibility purposes, any financial assistance (in excess of amounts received for tuition) that an individual receives under the Higher Education Act of 1965, from private sources, or an institution of higher education, shall be considered income to that individual, except for a person over age 23 with dependent children. (Sec. 214) Requires that the funds made available for Native American Housing Block Grants in title III of this Act be allocated to the same recipients that received funds in FY2005.

Authorizes the Secretary, however, to the extent that such a multifamily property is not feasible for continued payments, based on specified cost, operation, or environmental considerations, to: (1) contract, in consultation with the property's tenants, for project-based rental assistance payments with an owner or owners of other existing housing properties; or (2) provide other rental assistance. (Sec. 217) Requires the Secretary to report quarterly to congressional appropriations committees on HUD use of all sole source contracts. (Sec. 218) States that, during FY2013, a family residing in an assisted living facility in any county of Michigan with a section 8 rental assistance demonstration program, and on behalf of which a PHA provides such assistance, may be required, when the family initially receives the assistance, to pay rent in an amount exceeding 40% of the family's monthly adjusted income by any percentage or amount the Secretary determines appropriate. (Sec. 219) Authorizes any recipient after December 26, 2000, of a grant for conversion of elderly housing to assisted living facilities to: (1) establish a single-asset nonprofit entity to own the project; and (2) lend the grant funds to such entity, which may be a for-profit limited partnership the sole general partner of which is a private nonprofit organization meeting specified requirements, or a corporation wholly owned and controlled by such a private nonprofit organization. (Sec. 220) Authorizes the use of Community Development Loan Guarantee funds in FY2013 to guarantee, or make commitments to guarantee, notes or other obligations issued by any state on behalf of its non-entitlement communities. (Sec. 221) Authorizes PHAs that own and operate 400 or fewer public housing units to elect to be exempt from any asset management requirements imposed by the Secretary in connection with the operating fund rule. Prohibits exemption from such requirements, however, for an agency seeking a discontinuance of a reduction of subsidy under the operating fund formula. (Sec. 222) Prohibits the Secretary, with respect to the use of funds for the operation, capital improvement, and management of public housing authorized by the United States Housing Act of 1937, from imposing any asset management requirement or guideline that restricts or limits in any way the use of capital funds for central office costs. Prohibits a PHA, however, from using capital funds authorized for eligible operation and management activities with operating funds in excess of specified permitted amounts. (Sec. 223) Prohibits designation of a HUD official or employee as an allotment holder unless he or she has: (1) implemented an adequate system of funds control, and (2) received training in funds control procedures and directives.

(Sec. 225) Requires the Secretary for FY2013 and thereafter to notify the public through the Federal Register and other appropriate means of the issuance of a notice of the availability of assistance or notice of funding availability (NOFA) for any program or discretionary fund that is to be awarded competitively. Authorizes the Secretary for such period to make the NOFA available only on the Internet at the appropriate government website or through other electronic media. (Sec. 227) Considers the HUD-administered Disaster Housing Assistance Programs as a HUD program under the McKinney Act for income verification and matching purposes. (Sec. 228) Prohibits during any PHA FY2013 the use of funds, made available for specified purposes of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (including the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance program), by any PHA for any amount of salary for its chief executive officer, or any other official or employee that exceeds the annual rate of basic pay for a position at level IV of the Executive Schedule. (Sec. 229) Amends the National Housing Act to extend through July 31, 2016, the exemption that authorizes the Secretary to provide mortgage insurance to critical access hospitals. (Sec. 230) Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, with respect to loan guarantees for Indian housing, to increase the maximum fee from 1% to 3% of a loan's principal obligation. Authorizes the Secretary also to establish and collect annual premium payments of up to 1% of the remaining guaranteed balance (excluding the portion attributable to a collected fee). (Sec. 231) Amends the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act to revise requirements with respect to termination of tenancy by an owner of affordable housing assisted under such Act for rental. States that the mandatory 30-day notice is not required if the grounds for the termination or refusal to renew a lease involve a direct threat to the safety of the tenants or employees of the housing, or an imminent and serious threat to the property (and the termination or refusal to renew is in accordance with requirements of state or local law). Revises requirements regarding the recapture and reuse of funds set-aside for investment only in housing to be developed, sponsored, or owned by community housing development organizations. Requires the Secretary to deduct any such funds remaining uninvested for a 24-month period from the line of credit in the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund and reallocate them by a specified reallocation formula other than the current direct reallocation formula. (Sec. 232) Authorizes through FY2013 the continued provision of funds under prior appropriations Acts for Revitalization of Severely Distressed Public Housing (HOPE VI) funding or for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative funding as assistance for project demolition, site revitalization, replacement housing, and tenant-based assistance grants. (Sec. 233) Changes from quarterly to annual the reports to congressional appropriations committees on all steps taken to prevent fraud and abuse of Community Development Funds, especially in the form of duplication of benefits. (Sec. 234) Amends the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 to repeal the mandatory transfer to the Flexible Subsidy Fund of all uncommitted balances in the Rental Housing Assistance Fund of certain excess rental charges as of September 30, 2007, as well as any collections made during FY2008 and all subsequent fiscal years. Title III: Related Agencies - Makes appropriations for FY2013 to: (1) the Access Board, (2) the Federal Maritime Commission, (3) the Office of Inspector General for the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), (4) the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), (5) the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, and (6) the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. Title IV: General Provisions (This Act) - Specifies certain uses and limits on or prohibitions against the use of funds appropriated by this Act. (Sec. 401) Requires any sums necessary for FY2013 pay raises for programs funded in this Act to be absorbed within the levels appropriated in this or previous appropriations Acts.
