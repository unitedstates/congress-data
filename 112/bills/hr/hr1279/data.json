    "text": "Aircraft Passenger Whole-Body Imaging Limitations Act of 2011 - Directs the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (Transportation Security Administration) (TSA) to ensure that advanced imaging technology is used for the screening of passengers only in accordance with this Act. Prohibits the use of advanced imaging technology as a method of screening a passenger unless: (1) the National Academy of Sciences determines the technology does not pose a threat to public health; (2) the technology is equipped with a privacy filter or other privacy-protecting technology; and (3) another method of screening, such as metal detection, explosive trace detection, or behavioral profiling, demonstrates reasonable cause for using advanced imaging technology to detect a possible threat to aviation security. Allows use of an enhanced pat-down search of passengers if such other screening methods, including use of advanced imaging technology, demonstrate reasonable cause for utilizing advanced imaging technology to detect a possible threat to aviation security. Requires that passengers: (1) be provided information on the operation of such technology and specified related matters, including privacy policies and the right to request a pat-down search; and (2) be offered such a pat-down search in lieu of such screening. Prohibits the storage, transfer, sharing, or copying in any form of an image of a passenger generated by advanced imaging technology after a boarding determination is made. Imposes a civil penalty upon any U.S. officer or employee who knowingly stores, transfers, shares, or copies advanced imaging screening images. Prohibits the Secretary of Transportation from using any security technology or methodology for screening passengers unless there are established performance measures to determine if: (1) such technology is cost effective, reliable, and safe; and (2) there is no other equally effective and less invasive technology."
