Requires that: (1) amounts deposited in the Fund be allocated annually to any appropriation not for a military purpose, (2) the Secretary report to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees on the total amount transferred into the Fund during the preceding fiscal year and the purposes for which such amount was allocated, and (3) the privacy of individuals using the Fund be protected. Expresses the sense of Congress that any revenue increase resulting from the creation of the Fund be allocated in a manner consistent with its purposes."
