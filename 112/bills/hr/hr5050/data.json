    "text": "Social Networking Online Protection Act - Prohibits employers from: (1) requiring or requesting that an employee or applicant for employment provide a user name, password, or any other means for accessing a private email account or personal account on a social networking website; or (2) discharging, disciplining, discriminating against, denying employment or promotion to, or threatening to take any such action against any employee or applicant who refuses to provide such information, files a compliant or institutes a proceeding under this Act, or testifies in any such proceeding. Sets forth, with respect to employer violations of this Act: (1) civil penalities; (2) the authority of the Secretary of Labor to bring injunctive actions; and (3) the jurisdiction of U.S. district courts to provide legal or equitable relief including employment, reinstatement, promotion, and payment of lost wages and benefits. Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to prohibit certain institutions of higher education and local educational agencies from requesting such password or account information from students or potential students. Prohibits denial of admission, suspension, expulsion, and other discipline or discrimination against students who decline to provide such information, file a complaint, institute a proceeding, or testify in any related proceeding."
