Authorizes the head of a federal agency to: (1) waive such requirement for a federal contract or grant and to report such waiver to Congress within 30 days with a justification, and (2) exempt from debarment any person who voluntarily reports a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. Declares that it is U.S. government policy that no government contracts or grants should be awarded to individuals or companies who violate that Act after the enactment of this Act."
