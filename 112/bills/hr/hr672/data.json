Transfers specified election administration functions of the EAC to the Federal Election Commission (FEC). (Sec. 3) Replaces the Standards Board and the Board of Advisors with a Guidelines Review Board to review voluntary voting system guidelines proposed by the Technical Guidelines Development Committee. (Sec. 4) Sets forth special requirements relating to the transfer of certain EAC authorities to the FEC with respect to development of such guidelines. Transfers to the FEC the EAC Office of Voting System Testing and Certification. (Sec. 7) Directs the Comptroller General to: (1) study the procedures used to adopt and modify the voluntary voting system guidelines applicable to the administration of elections for federal office, and (2) develop recommendations on methods to improve such procedures. Requires the FEC to: (1) study the procedures for the testing, certification, decertification, and recertification of voting system hardware and software used in federal elections, and (2) develop a recommendation on the entity best suited to oversee and carry out such procedures. Requires the recommendations in both studies to take into account the needs of persons affected by such guidelines, including state and local election officials, voters with disabilities, absent military and overseas voters, and the manufacturers of voting systems."
