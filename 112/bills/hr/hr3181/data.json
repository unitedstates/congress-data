Requires the OMB Director to: (1) conduct a review of each rule that became effective after October 1, 1991, and that is in effect as of the enactment date of this Act, and (2) report on the estimated total annual costs and benefits of each rule and recommend whether it should continue or how it should be reformed.\u00a0 Repeals all such rules one year after the enactment of this Act unless specifically authorized by law and enacted after the date of enactment of this Act. Sets forth exceptions for certain rulemaking actions and rules, including those necessary because of an imminent threat to health or safety or other emergency, for the enforcement of criminal laws, or to establish or enforce statutory rights against discrimination. Requires each federal agency head to designate a Regulatory Review Officer\u00a0to testify before Congress on any request to\u00a0prevent the repeal of a rule under this Act."
