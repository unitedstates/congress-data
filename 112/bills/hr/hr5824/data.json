Replaces entitlement to a matching grant with entitlement to a supplemental grant for such territories of: (1) 10% of the payable family assistance grant to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam; and (2) $100,000 to American Samoa. Amends part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) of SSA title XI to make such territories: (1) eligible for the TANF Contingency Fund for State Welfare Programs; (2) Needy States if they satisfy alternative eligibility criteria established by the Secretary; and (3) eligible for child care entitlement funds. Prescribes a formula for allotment of child care entitlement funds to such territories. Amends part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of SSA title XI to increase the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for foster care and adoption assistance in such territories."
