Requires the appropriate congressional ethics committee to open an inquiry immediately into the tax delinquency of that Member to determine: (1) his or her total delinquent tax liability and reason for such delinquency, (2) whether the Member has a plan to eliminate it, and (3) whether it has reflected poorly on Congress. Requires such Member to arrange with the Secretary of the Senate or the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives, as appropriate, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to have his or her salary reduced by an amount appropriate to pay the taxes owed to the United States within a reasonable time period."
