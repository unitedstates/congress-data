Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a tax on imports of goods and services from any foreign country that employs an indirect tax system and grants rebates of indirect taxes paid on goods or services exported from that country. Requires deposit of such taxes into a special account. Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS), acting through the Commissioner responsible for the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, upon request of a U.S. exporter, to grant a rebate from this special account to an exporter of goods or services from the United States to such a foreign country of the equivalent of any indirect taxes the foreign country imposes or applies to such goods and services at its border, with certain adjustments."
