Requires trade-related legislation introduced in Congress after the enactment of this Act to include provisions providing for labor standards, environmental and public safety standards, and foreign investment in the United States. Provides funding for the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to include as a \"countervailable subsidy\" requiring action under a countervailing duty or antidumping duty proceeding the benefit conferred on merchandise imported into the United States from foreign countries with fundamentally undervalued currency. Regional Partnerships for High-Quality Jobs Act - Directs the Secretaries of Labor and Education to establish a grant program to educate and train workers for high-quality employment. College and Career Ready Classrooms Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award grants for the development, implementation, and monitoring of comprehensive, statewide professional development to increase the effectiveness of all teachers in the instruction of college and career-ready state standards and the development and use of curriculum that is aligned with such standards.

Establishes the amount of such tax as the excess (if any) of the tentative fair share tax over the excess of: (1) the sum of the taxpayer's regular tax liability, the alternative minimum tax (AMT) amount, and the payroll tax for the taxable year; over (2) certain tax credits. Increases the capital gains tax rate for certain high-income taxpayers.
