Requires the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to develop a policy for federal science agencies to carry out a program of workshops that educate specified federally funded researchers about methods that minimize the effects of gender bias in the evaluation of federal research grants and in the related academic advancement of the recipients of these grants. Authorizes federal science agencies to make grants to eligible organizations to carry out workshops. Requires OSTP to support at least one workshop every two years among the federal science agencies in the major science and engineering disciplines. Requires the Director to develop a policy to extend research grant support and provide interim technical support for federally funded researchers who are caregivers. Requires federal science agencies to collect specified standardized annual data for all applications for research and development grants to IHEs and to submit the data collected to the NSF. Requires NSF to report statistical summary data on the demographics of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) faculty at IHEs in the United States and report to Congress on how NSF will gather such data."
