Directs the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to certify annually to Congress that such AFRTS-broadcast programming represents best-faith efforts to communicate the DOD's policies, priorities, programs, goals, and initiatives while avoiding airing programming with values contrary to Armed Forces and U.S. values."
