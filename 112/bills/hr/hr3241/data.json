    "text": "International Travelers Bill of Rights Act of 2011 - Requires an individual or entity that operates a website that provides access to international travel services to provide to consumers information regarding the health and safety risks associated with overseas vacation destinations marketed on such website, including: (1) information compiled by the Department of State that includes country-specific travel warnings and alerts; and (2) information on the availability of on site health and safety services at a destination, including the hours and days such services are available, or a disclaimer that such destination does not provide certain health and safety services or that information regarding such services is not available. Requires a website operator that does not possess information on a destination's health and safety services to request it from that destination. Grants the website operator immunity from liability relating to inaccurate or incomplete information if such information was provided by the destination and the operator published it without knowledge that it was inaccurate or incomplete. Treats a violation as an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to require the Secretary of State to: (1) collect and include in the database on overseas deaths of U.S. citizens from non-natural causes information on the name and address of the property where a death occurred, and (2) update the database not less frequently than once each month (currently, every six months) and to report such updated information to Congress."
