(The FCC Order relates to Universal Service Fund [USF] expenditures and the adoption, on April 25, 2012, of a methodology for establishing benchmarks for capital and operating costs reimbursable to rate-of-return cost companies from high-cost loop support.) Directs the FCC to report to Congress on alternatives to the methodology in such Order and to make such report available to the public on the FCC website. Prohibits the FCC from adopting such an alternative methodology until a specified period after the report is submitted to Congress."
