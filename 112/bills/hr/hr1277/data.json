Directs the Secretary to focus on projects in areas impacted by the illegal smuggling and trafficking of people and drugs. Declares that persons eligible for grants include states, counties, municipalities, organizations representing agricultural producers and other rural Americans, and telecommunications providers. Repeals the International Forestry Cooperation Act of 1990 to offset sums appropriated under this Act."
