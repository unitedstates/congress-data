Directs the Secretary of State to submit to Congress the U.S. government's strategic plan and goals for international nuclear safety cooperation for operating power reactors. Sets forth reporting requirements regarding: (1) implementation of such strategic plan, and (2) U.S. efforts to further international nuclear safety.
