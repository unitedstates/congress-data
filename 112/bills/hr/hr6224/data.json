    "text": "Providing Assistance with the Paperwork from Excessive Regulations Act of 2012 - Amends the Paperwork Reduction Act to direct agency heads not to impose a civil fine for a first-time paperwork violation by a small business concern unless: (1) there is potential for serious harm to the public interest; (2) the detection of criminal activity would be impaired; (3) the violation is a violation of an internal revenue law or a law concerning the assessment or collection of any tax, debt, revenue, or receipt; (4) the small business concern fails to correct such violation within six months after receiving notice of the violation; or (5) the violation presents a danger to the public health or safety. Permits an agency to determine that a fine should not be imposed for a violation that presents a danger to public health or safety if the violation is corrected within five days after receipt by the small business concern of notification of the violation in writing. Makes this Act inapplicable to any violation by a small business concern of a requirement regarding the collection of information by an agency if the small business concern previously violated any requirement regarding the collection of information by that agency."
