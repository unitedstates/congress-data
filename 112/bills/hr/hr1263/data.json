Requires each lending institution subject to specified requirements for a maximum 6% rate of interest on a servicemember's debts incurred before military service to designate one of its employees as a compliance officer responsible for: (1) ensuring the institution's compliance with such requirements, and (2) distributing information to servicemembers whose obligations and liabilities are covered by such requirements. Requires such a lending institution that had annual assets for the preceding fiscal year of $10 billion or more to maintain a toll-free telephone number and make it available on its primary Internet website. Extends from 9 months to 12 months after the end of military service the period of specified protections for servicemembers against mortgage foreclosures. Sunsets such extension on December 31, 2017."
