Defines \"windfall profit\" as so much of the profit from sales of oil and natural gas as exceeds a reasonable profit. Establishes a Reasonable Profits Board to make reasonable profit determinations for purposes of applying the windfall profit tax. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to make grants to mass transit systems, including bus and commuter rail systems, for reducing passenger fares."
