    "text": "WMD Prevention and Preparedness Act of 2012 - Title I: A National Biodefense Enterprise - (Sec. 101) Requires the President to assign a member of the National Security Council as Special Assistant to the President for Biodefense to: (1) serve as the President's principal advisor regarding coordination of federal biodefense policy; (2) identify inefficiencies in existing biodefense activities and the actions necessary to overcome them; (3) lead the development of a coordinated National Biodefense Plan, a coordinated National Biosurveillance Strategy, and a coordinated national research and development strategy and implementation plan for microbial forensics; (4) oversee, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the development of a comprehensive cross-cutting biodefense budget analysis to inform prioritization of resources and ensure that biodefense challenges are adequately addressed; and (5) conduct ongoing oversight and evaluation of implementation of federal biodefense activities by relevant government agencies. (Sec. 102) Directs the Special Assistant to submit to the President and update as necessary a National Biodefense Plan that: (1) defines the scope and purpose of a national biodefense capability; (2) identifies biological risks to the nation and activities and tasks to be performed to address them; (3) defines organizational roles, responsibilities, and coordination of federal, state, local, and tribal authorities with respect to such activities and tasks; (4) defines research and development needs for improving the capacity for threat awareness and prevention, protection, response, and recovery; (5) identifies biodefense assets, interdependencies, and capability gaps; (6) provides goals and performance measures; (7) identifies resource and investment needs; (8) integrates and supports the strategies outlined in Presidential Policy Directives 2 and 8 and Homeland Security Presidential Directives 5, 9, 10, 18, and 21, the National Biosurveillance Strategy, and the National Medical Countermeasure Dispensing Strategy; (9) is consistent with the National Response Framework; (10) incorporates input from federal, state, local, and tribal stakeholders; and (11) provides planning guidance to biosecurity and biodefense stakeholders. (Sec. 103) Directs the Special Assistant to publish and update every four years a National Biosurveillance Strategy that: (1) identifies the purpose and scope of a nationally integrated biosurveillance capability; (2) establishes objectives and performance measures to guide the development of such capability; (3) defines and prioritizes costs, benefits, and resource and investment needs, with particular attention to leveraging existing resources; (4) delineates federal, state, local, tribal, and private roles and responsibilities; and (5) describes how the Strategy is integrated with related national strategies. Requires the Special Assistant to publish an implementation plan for such Strategy that includes a plan for: (1) advancing situational awareness of biological threats; (2) fostering information sharing among national biosecurity and biodefense stakeholders to identify potential threats, reduce vulnerabilities, and improve collective response to and investigations of suspected biological attacks; and (3) enhancing the capability of the federal government to rapidly identify, characterize, localize, and track a biological event of national concern by integrating and analyzing data relating to human health, animal, plant, food, and environmental monitoring systems. (Sec. 104) Requires the Special Assistant, in coordination with the Director of OMB, to transmit to specified congressional committees, concurrent with the submission of the President's annual budget to Congress, a comprehensive cross-cutting biodefense budget analysis that delineates and integrates the biodefense expenditure requests for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense (DOD), Energy (DOE), Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security, Justice, State, and Veterans Affairs (VA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF). Title II: Intelligence Matters - (Sec. 201) Requires the DNI to develop and implement: (1) a National Intelligence Strategy for Countering the Threat from Weapons of Mass Destruction that is designed to improve U.S. capabilities to collect, analyze, and disseminate intelligence related to weapons of mass destruction (WMD); and (2) a plan to implement such Strategy. Requires such Strategy to: (1) identify and address core capabilities needed for successful intelligence collection on WMD; (2) include methods for the recruitment, training, and retention of a workforce with expertise in the collection, analysis, and dissemination of intelligence related to all types of WMD and science and technology related to WMD, as well as expertise in science and technology relating to risks posed by WMD; and (3) include methods for information sharing and collaboration with non-federal national biosecurity and biodefense stakeholders. Requires the implementation plan to include: (1) actions necessary to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the sharing of intelligence on WMD throughout the Intelligence Community and with other federal partners; (2) methods to disseminate intelligence products to national biosecurity and biodefense stakeholders in classified and unclassified formats to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of information sharing; and (3) actions necessary to provide open-source intelligence relating to WMD to appropriate federal agencies, state, local, and tribal authorities, and private entities. (Sec. 202) Requires the DNI to develop and implement: (1) a National Intelligence Strategy for Countering Biological Threats that is integrated into the National Intelligence Strategy for Countering the Threat from Weapons of Mass Destruction, and (2) a plan for implementing such Strategy. Requires such Strategy to: (1) identify and address target capabilities needed for successful intelligence collection on biological threats; (2) include a plan for establishing in the Intelligence Community a cadre of collectors and analysts that are familiar with biological threats, biological science, and biotechnology; (3) include a plan for defining the functions, capabilities, and gaps in that Community's workforce with respect to assessing the biological threat; (4) include methods for collaboration with non-Intelligence Community technical experts within and outside of the federal government, in particular with state and local biodefense stakeholders; (5) include a plan for defining, integrating, focusing, and enhancing existing capabilities in the Intelligence Community dedicated to current and strategic biological threats; and (6) include a plan for ensuring the prioritization and sustained commitment of intelligence personnel and resources to address biological threats.
