    "text": "Clean Fuels Innovation Act of 2012 - Requires the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) complete the Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Solar Energy Development in Six Southwestern States in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) to analyze the potential impacts of the development of renewable energy on public land and any land use plans, and (2) amend such land use plans as determined appropriate. Establishes similar requirements for the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) with respect to National Forest System land. Requires the Secretary of Interior to establish a renewable energy leasing pilot program under which lease sales of certain sites are conducted on covered lands administered by the Secretary to carry out renewable energy projects. Requires the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to jointly determine whether or not to expand the pilot program to all covered lands. Defines \"covered land\" to mean land that is public land or National Forest System land and not excluded from the development of renewable energy under federal law. Establishes the Renewable Energy Resource Conservation Fund to be administered by the Secretary of the Interior for mitigating the impacts of renewable energy on federal land and carrying out any activity authorized under the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965, with the exception of the acquisition of land, water, or interests therein. Requires the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to submit a report that: (1) identifies locations on certain military installations in the United States that could be developed for renewable energy production, and (2) describes the administration of the development of commercial-scale renewable energy projects on such installations. Requires the Secretary of Defense to publish a notice of intent to prepare an EIS to support the development of renewable energy on the locations identified. Requires the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to determine the feasibility of carrying out a mitigation banking program on federal lands administered by the Secretaries to offset the impacts of renewable energy on such lands."
