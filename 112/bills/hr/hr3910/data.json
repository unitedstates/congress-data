Limits the federal share of each project to 25%. Prohibits the Secretary from providing funds for project operation and maintenance. Directs the Secretary to enter into individual agreements with the San Francisco Bay Area Regional Water Coalition participating agencies to fund projects under such Act. Allows the Secretary to include in such agreements a provision for the reimbursement of construction costs, including those construction costs incurred prior to this Act's enactment. Increases the authorization of appropriations for the design, planning, and construction of: (1) recycled water system facilities in cooperation with the city of Antioch, California; and (2) recycled water treatment facilities in cooperation with the city of San Jose, California, and the Santa Clara Valley Water District."
