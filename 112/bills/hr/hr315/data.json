Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a process under which a physician may request from a carrier written assistance in addressing questionable codes and procedures under the Medicare program. Prohibits the Administrator from implementing any new evaluation and management (E&M) guidelines under the Medicare program unless the Administrator: (1) has provided for an assessment of the proposed guidelines by physicians; (2) has established a plan that contains specific goals, including a schedule for improving participation of physicians in such assessment; (3) has carried out a minimum of four pilot projects in at least four different regions to test E&M guidelines; and (4) finds that specified objectives will be met in the implementation of such guidelines. Sets forth provisions concerning: (1) physician participation and pilot program testing requirements and objectives for new E&M guidelines under Medicare; and (2) notice, administrative, and penalty requirements with respect to Medicare overpayments."
