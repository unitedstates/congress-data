Directs the SBA Administrator to modify SBIR policy directives to provide for an increase to $200,000 the amount which an agency may award in the first phase of an SBIR program, and to $1.5 million the amount for the second phase, with an adjustment of such amounts once every five years to reflect economic adjustments and programmatic considerations. Increases from 0.3% to 0.6% the amount that each federal agency with an extramural research or research and development budget in excess of $1 billion must spend specifically in connection with the SBA's Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program. Increases from $100,000 to $200,000, and from $750,000 to $1.5 million, respectively, the amounts which such agency may award in the first and second phases of STTR programs, with the same five-year adjustment as made under the SBIR program."
