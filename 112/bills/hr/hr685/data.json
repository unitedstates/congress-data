Directs the Assistant Secretary, Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to certify that, in order to improve airport security screening processes while ensuring passenger privacy protection, the image retention capabilities of all advanced imaging technology utilized by TSA to screen passengers at checkpoints in our nation's airports have been disabled."
