    "text": "Cainaan Putuga Wendt Shock of Life Act - Directs the Secretary of Education to award matching grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to: (1) purchase automated external defibrillators (AEDs) for use in public or private secondary schools within their district, and (2) provide training to meet the grant requirement that at least five adult employees or volunteers at each school where a purchased AED is to be used are or will be certified in its use and in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Requires LEA grant applicants also to demonstrate that: (1) the AEDs are integrated into the schools' emergency response procedures, and (2) emergency services personnel are notified of their locations. Gives grant priority to LEAs that have secondary schools that: (1) lack an AED; (2) typically have a significant number of students, staff, and visitors present during the day; and (3) generally have a longer wait for emergency medical services than other public facilities in the community."
