    "text": "Public Housing Reinvestment and Tenant Protection Act of 2011 - Choice Neighborhoods Initiative Act of 2011 - Requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to make competitive grants to local governments, public housing agencies (PHAs), or nonprofit entities owning a major housing project to implement transformational programs in eligible neighborhoods with a concentration of extreme poverty and severely distressed housing. Public Housing One-for-One Replacement and Tenant Protection Act of 2011 - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 with respect to: (1) demolition, disposition, or both pursuant to conversion of any public housing unit; and (2) the taking of public housing units through the use of eminent domain. Exempts from specified requirements for demolition and disposition of public housing any public housing projects removed from a PHA inventory under the program for conversion of demolished or distressed public housing dwelling units to tenant-based assistance. Public Housing Preservation and Rehabilitation Act of 2011 - Authorizes the Secretary to guarantee notes or other obligations issued by PHAs to finance: (1) the rehabilitation of PHA public housing; (2) the modernization of such housing through energy efficiency improvements; or (3) the construction, rehabilitation, purchase, or conversion of public housing units to replace any demolished, disposed of, or converted. Prescribes requirements for PHAs that utilize housing tax credits under the Internal Revenue Code for rental housing units. Removes a specified limitation on the use of amounts from the public housing Capital Fund or Operation Fund by a PHA to construct new public housing units. Permits a PHA to use amounts from the Capital Fund for public housing units not included in the regular formula for determining the amount of assistance, subject to certain conditions. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to PHAs for conversion of public housing projects to assisted living facilities or service-enriched housing for elderly persons. Allows PHAs that own or operate fewer than 500 public housing units to elect to be exempt from any asset management requirement imposed by the Secretary. Together We Care Act of 2011 - Requires the Secretary to establish a competitive grant pilot program for eligible entities to train public housing residents as home health aides and as providers of home-based health services for residents of public housing or federally-assisted rental housing who are elderly, disabled, or both."
