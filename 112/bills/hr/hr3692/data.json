Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to terminate such alien's status for fraud or failure to meet status requirements during the 60-month period after obtaining such status. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of Education to submit a recruitment, retainment, and investment strategic plan to Congress to attract skilled and talented foreign nationals to immigrate to the United States to create jobs and grow the economy."
