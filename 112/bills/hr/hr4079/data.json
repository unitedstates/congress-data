Directs the Secretary, in awarding such grants, to give priority to entities seeking a grant or assistance for a project that includes making improvements to a building to ensure that the building meets such codes and other requirements. Requires entities receiving grants or assistance for the fiscal year during which this Act is enacted to submit such a certification within two years after enactment."
