Amends the PHSA to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award matching grants to states or Indian tribes to expend funds for the construction or modernization of facilities used to provide mental health and substance abuse services to individuals. Expands the 340B drug discount program (a program limiting the cost of covered outpatient drugs to certain federal grantees) to allow participation by entities providing community mental health services or providing treatment services for substance abuse."
