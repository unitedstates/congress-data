Directs the Secretary of Commerce to issue regulations prohibiting, with specified exceptions, any U.S. person from taking specified actions that support any boycott imposed by a foreign country against a country that is friendly to the United States and is not itself the object of any form of boycott pursuant to United States law or regulation. Sets forth criminal and civil penalties for violations of such regulations."
