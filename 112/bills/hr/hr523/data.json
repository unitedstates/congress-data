Abrogates U.S. sovereign immunity and makes the United States exclusively liable for such claims. Limits awards to actual damages sustained by a claimant. Defines \"qualified entity\" to mean an entity engaged in the manufacture, use, sale, or distribution of: (1) transportation fuel or renewable fuel, or (2) products which use transportation fuel. Grants U.S. district courts exclusive jurisdiction of any civil actions on such claims."
