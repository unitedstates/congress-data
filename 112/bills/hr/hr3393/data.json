Treats such owners or operators as a responsible party with respect to the incident for the purposes of such Act in the same manner as a responsible party for an offshore facility. Requires the current liability limit to be multiplied by three when applied to a foreign offshore unit that is involved in such incident and is located in the territorial sea or on the continental shelf of a foreign country that is a state sponsor of terrorism. Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to: (1) prohibit the discharge of oil from a foreign offshore unit that reaches the navigable waters of the United States, adjoining shorelines, or waters of the contiguous zone; and (2) subject the owner or operator of the unit to penalties under such Act; and (3) require maximum penalties under such Act to be multiplied by three when applied with respect to such unit located in the territorial sea or on the continental shelf of a foreign country that is a state sponsor of terrorism."
