Ends the grace period on the earliest of the following: (1) the date on which the supplier's application for accrediation is approved; (2) the date on which the application is denied; or (3) the end of the six-month period beginning on the date the first image or set of images obtained from an advanced diagnostic imaging service is conducted."
