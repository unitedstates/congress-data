Amends the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 to instruct the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize under a general license certain travel-related transactions for travel to, from, or within Cuba in connection with either exploration and extraction of hydrocarbon resources or oil spill prevention and clean-up activities in any such part of a foreign maritime exclusive economic zone contiguous to the U.S. exclusive economic zone. Includes among persons authorized to travel to Cuba under this Act full-time employees, executives, agents, and consultants of oil and gas producers, distributors, shippers, and persons who engage in oil spill prevention and clean-up activities."
