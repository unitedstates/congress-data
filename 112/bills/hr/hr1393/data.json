Prohibits an individual from being employed by any person conducting any activity under a lease or permit issued by BOEMRE\u00a0 or subject to BOEMRE\u00a0 regulation for two years after leaving employment with BOEMR. Directs the Secretary, acting through BOEMRE, to conduct monthly inspections of each vessel and facility used for Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) oil or gas drilling. Prohibits the Secretary from exempting any category of activity of a vessel or facility engaged in OCS oil or gas drilling in waters deeper than 1,000 feet from any federal requirement or restriction that applies to such activity. Amends the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to repeal the liability limits applicable to a responsible party for discharge of oil from an offshore facility."
