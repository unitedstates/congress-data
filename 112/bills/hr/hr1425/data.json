    "text": "Creating Jobs Through Small Business Innovation Act of 2011 - Title I: Reauthorization of the SBIR and STTR Programs - (Sec. 101) Amends the Small Business Act (the Act) to reauthorize through FY2014 the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs of the Small Business Administration (SBA). (Sec. 102) Increases, for both the SBIR and STTR programs, the individual small business award levels from: (1) $100,000 to $150,000, for participation at the Phase I level; and (2) $750,000 to $1 million, for participation at the Phase II level. Changes from every five years to annually the required SBA inflation adjustment of such awards. Prohibits an agency from issuing an SBIR or STTR award if the award size exceeds established guidelines by more than 50%, and requires participating agencies to maintain specified information on awards exceeding such guidelines. (Sec. 103) Allows a small business that receives a: (1) Phase I SBIR award from one agency to receive a Phase II award from another agency, as long as the head of each agency determines that the topics of the relevant awards are the same; and (2) Phase I award under either the SBIR or STTR program to receive a Phase II award under either program. (Sec. 104) Requires federal agencies to conduct solicitations of Phase II SBIR and STTR proposals without any invitation, pre-screening, pre-selection, or down-selection process between the first and second phases. (Sec. 105) Allows a federal agency to provide a Phase II SBIR only if the agency finds that the small business has been provided a Phase I SBIR award with respect to that project or has completed required determinations with respect to such project despite not having been provided a Phase I award. (Sec. 106) Authorizes the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Secretary of Energy, and the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF), 30 days after notifying the Administrator and specified congressional committees, to award through competitive, merit-based procedures up to 45% of their respective SBIR funds to small businesses majority-owned by multiple venture capital companies, hedge funds, or private equity firms (such entities). Permits other federal agencies to award up to 35% of their SBIR funds to such small businesses. Provides conditions under which a small business which was not majority-owned by any such entities at the time of application for an SBIR award, but is so owned on the date of the award, may still be eligible for such award. (Sec. 107) Provides conditions and requirements for allowing small businesses with less than 50% investment from entities described above to participate in SBIR and STTR programs. (Sec. 108) Requires federal agencies and federal prime contractors, to the greatest extent practicable, to issue Phase III awards relating to technology, including sole source awards, to the SBIR and STTR award recipients that developed the technology. (Sec. 109) Authorizes the head of each participating federal agency to issue SBIR and STTR awards to small businesses that have entered, or intend to enter, into a collaborative research and development (R&D) agreement with a federal laboratory or federally funded research and development center.
