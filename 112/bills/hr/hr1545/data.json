    "text": "Waco Mammoth National Monument Establishment Act of 2011 - Establishes the Waco Mammoth National Monument in Texas as a unit of the National Park System. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into cooperative management agreements with Baylor University and the city of Waco, Texas (the city). Permits the Secretary to acquire by donation only from the city any land or interest in land owned by the city within the proposed boundary of the Monument. Requires the Secretary, in consultation with Baylor University and the city, to complete a general management plan for the Monument. Provides for the inclusion in such plan of opportunities for involvement by the University, the city, the state of Texas, and other local and national entities in the development of educational programs for the Monument and for the development and support of the Monument. Prohibits the use of federal funding to pay the costs of: (1) carrying out a cooperative agreement under this Act, (2) acquiring land for inclusion in the Monument, (3) developing a visitor center, (4) operating or maintaining the Monument, (5) constructing exhibits, or (6) developing the general management plan. Permits the use of non-federal funding to pay any costs that may be incurred by the Secretary or the National Park Service (NPS) to carry out this Act. Prohibits anything in this Act from affecting the eligibility of the Monument for federal grants or other financial assistance for which the Monument would have been eligible had System status not been conferred upon it. Terminates the designation of the Monument as a unit of the System if federal funding is required for the operation and maintenance of the Monument. Requires any land acquired by the Secretary from the city to revert to the city if such designation is terminated. Prohibits any private property from being made a part of the Monument without the owner's written consent. Prohibits anything in this Act, the establishment of such national monument, or the management plan from being construed as creating buffer zones outside of such monument. Bars an activity or use that can be seen or heard from within the Monument from precluding the conduct of that activity or use outside the Monument."
