Prohibits the federal government from promulgating or enforcing regulations under the provisions of the health reform law that are not in effect on the date of enactment of this Act, or otherwise prepare to implement such provisions. Establishes the Affordable Care Evaluation Commission to report to the President and Congress a projection of the impact that the implementation of the provisions of the health reform law that are not in effect on the enactment of this Act would have on: (1) the quality of health care delivered to individuals who are Medicare recipients on the date of the enactment of this Act, (2) health insurance coverage of individuals insured as of such date, (3) participation in state exchanges and the effect on the federal deficit, and (4) job creation and the size of the tax base. Requires the report also to: (1) evaluate findings, conclusions, and recommendations developed by all other relevant government agencies regarding the facts and circumstances surrounding such implementation, and (2) recommend corrective measures to mitigate any negative impact of such implementation."
