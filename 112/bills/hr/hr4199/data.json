Defines \"general aviation aircraft\" as any airplane or helicopter not used in commercial or contract carrying of passengers or freight, but which primarily engages in the carrying of\u00a0passengers. Increases the work opportunity tax credit for the hiring of veterans by increasing the dollar limitation on veteran wages eligible\u00a0for such credit with revenue saved from the depreciation reclassification of general aviation aircraft by this Act."
