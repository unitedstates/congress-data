Authorizes the DNI to employ additional personnel to convert to performance by intelligence community (IC) personnel activities currently performed by contractor employees. Requires notification of the congressional intelligence committees in either case. Requires the DNI to establish guidelines to govern the treatment under authorized personnel levels of employment or assignment in: (1) a student program, trainee program, or similar program; (2) a reserve corps or as a reemployed annuitant; or (3) details, joint duty, or long term, full-time training.

Title III: General Provisions - (Sec. 301) Permits appropriations authorized by this Act for salary, pay, retirement, and other benefits for federal employees to be increased by such additional or supplemental amounts as necessary for increases in such compensation or benefits authorized by law. (Sec. 302) Prohibits the authorization of appropriations by this Act from being deemed to constitute authority to conduct any intelligence activity not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of the United States. (Sec. 303) Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to require the head of each element of the intelligence community (IC) to submit annually to the intelligence committees the number of personnel hired that were at any time a recipient of a grant or scholarship under the David L. Boren National Security Education Act of 1991.

(Sec. 309) Authorizes the heads of IC elements outside of DOD, in conducting intelligence and intelligence-related activities, to: (1) take certain procurement actions with respect to information technology in order to reduce the risk of loss of integrity which could result in a supply chain risk for an IC information system; and (2) limit the disclosure of information concerning the basis for taking such actions. Requires any IC element head, before taking such action, to: (1) determine that the use of such authority is necessary to protect national security by reducing supply chain risk and that less intrusive measures are not reasonably available, and (2) notify the DNI and the intelligence committees of such determination. Terminates such authority on January 7, 2014. (Sec. 310) Authorizes the head of an agency or department containing an IC element to pay a burial allowance to the estate of an individual who served as a civilian officer or employee of that agency or department, died as a result of an injury incurred during such service, and whose death resulted from terrorist activities or in connection with an intelligence activity having a substantial element of risk.

(Sec. 402) Provides that, for FY2010-FY2012, the federal requirement to submit an audited financial statement shall not apply to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (Office) if the DNI determines and notifies Congress that such statements cannot be produced on a cost-effective basis.

(Sec. 413) Requires the CIA to establish and maintain on its public website information relating to the CIA Office of the Inspector General, including means of contact. (Sec. 414) Expresses the sense of Congress that it is vitally important that the United States memorialize all the events that led to the raid that killed Osama bin Laden on May 1, 2011. Requires the CIA Director to submit to the intelligence committees a report that documents the history and lessons learned from such raid. (Sec. 415) Requires the OPM Inspector General to: (1) carry out a study of the personnel authorities and benefits of the CIA's Office of the Inspector General, and (2) submit to the intelligence and government affairs committees recommendations based on study results.

(Sec. 502) Expresses the sense of Congress that, 10 years after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks upon the United States, the Secretary of Homeland Security should continue to integrate and utilize fusion centers to enlist all U.S. intelligence, law enforcement, and homeland security capabilities to prevent future acts of terrorism against the United States. (Sec. 503) Requires the DNI and the Secretary of Defense to: (1) establish a coordinated strategy to identify and counter network activity and operations in Pakistan and Afghanistan relating to the development and use of improvised explosive devices, (2) submit the strategy to the intelligence and defense committees, and (3) implement the strategy. (Sec. 504) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the nation's railway transportation (including subway transit) network is broad and technically complex, requiring robust communication between private sector stakeholders and the IC to identify, monitor, and respond to threats; (2) the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis maintains a constructive relationship with other Federal agencies, state and local governments, and private entities to safeguard our railways; and (3) railway transportation security should continue to be prioritized in the critical infrastructure threat assessment developed by such Office and included in threat assessment budgets of the IC."
