Requires the Secretary to approve such an application unless approval would compromise security, detrimentally affect the efficiency or effectiveness of screening, or otherwise adversely affect the mission of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Authorizes the Secretary to carry out this Act acting through the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (TSA)."
