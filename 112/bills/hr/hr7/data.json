Allows Amtrak to provide food and beverage service on its trains only if the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) selects a qualified bidder whose bid would result in the lowest cost, or the greatest source of revenue, to Amtrak. (Under current law, Amtrak may provide such services on its trains only if revenues from the services each year at least equal the cost of providing them.) Authorizes the FRA to exempt Amtrak from such requirement if no qualified bidder responds to FRA requests for proposals. Prescribes an environmental review process for freight or intercity passenger rail capital project development decisionmaking. Authorizes the federal lead agency (DOT), at project sponsor request, to adopt and use a planning product (decisionmaking process) that integrates the planning and environmental review process of a rail project in National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) proceedings.

Authorizes such plans, in lieu of installing positive train control, to provide an alternative risk reduction strategy that would reduce the risk of release of poison- or toxic-by-inhalation hazmat to the same extent such risk of release would be reduced if positive train control were installed. Prescribes requirements for improving regulations issued by Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). Hazardous Material Transportation Safety, Efficiency, and Accountability Act of 2012 - Revises hazmat transportation safety requirements.
