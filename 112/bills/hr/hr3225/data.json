Authorizes the Secretary to make grants for initiatives in nontraditional communities to: (1) strengthen local food production, processing, and distribution; (2) create sustainable food systems; (3) encourage food assistance recipients to purchase locally grown or produced foods; (4) convert vacant land to agricultural production; and (5) support education and training. Amends the Farmer-to-Consumer Direct Marketing Act of 1976 to direct the Secretary to provide loans, loan guarantees, and grants to expand farmers markets. Gives assistance priority to nontraditional communities. Amends the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 to extend the seniors farmers market nutrition program. Gives assistance priority to: (1) nontraditional communities, and (2) farmers markets with an operational seniors farmers market program. Amends the Census of Agriculture Act of 1997 to require as part of each agriculture census an evaluation of the state of farmers markets in the United States."
