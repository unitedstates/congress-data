Prohibits the Assistant Secretary from exercising this authority, however, unless an agreement is in effect between the United States and the flight originating country requiring implementation of security standards and protocols determined comparable to those of the United States and therefore sufficiently effective to enable passengers to deplane into sterile areas of U.S. airports. Requires the Assistant Secretary to report annually to Congress on the re-screening of baggage."
