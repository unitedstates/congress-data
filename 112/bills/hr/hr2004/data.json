    "text": "Technology Security and Antiboycott Act - Technology Security Act - Directs the President to control the transfer of items (any goods, technology, software, and services) by U.S. persons and by foreign persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction in order to: (1) prevent the transfer of items that would pose a risk to U.S. national security or foreign policy; (2) secure the cooperation of other governments and multilateral organizations to impose similar controls; (3) maintain U.S. leadership in science, engineering, technology, and manufacturing; (4) sustain the viability of commercial firms, academic institutions, and research establishments; (5) sustain the domestic defense industrial base; and (6) enforce the controls through regulations, compliance requirements, controlled item lists, and lists of foreign persons who threaten U.S. national security or foreign policy. Requires a license for the transfer of items to a country if: (1) such country has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism; and (2) such items could make a significant contribution to such country's military potential, or could enhance its ability to support acts of international terrorism. Requires congressional notification before any license may be issued. Authorizes the President to establish a Transfer Policy Committee. Sets forth criminal and civil penalties for violations of such control and license provisions. Repeals the Export Administration Act of 1979. Antiboycott Act - Directs the President to issue regulations prohibiting, with specified exceptions, any U.S. person from taking specified actions to support (or actions to evade such regulations) any foreign-imposed or -fostered boycott against a country that is friendly to the United States and is not itself the object of any form of U.S. boycott. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of such regulations. Directs the President to impose specified sanctions against a U.S. person that knowingly: (1) exports, transfers, or otherwise engages in the trade of controlled defense items or missiles or related technology; or (2) conspires to, or facilitates, such export, transfer, or trade. Directs the President to impose procurement sanctions against a foreign person that knowingly and materially contributed to the efforts of a foreign country, project, or entity to use, develop, produce, or stockpile chemical or biological weapons through the export from: (1) the United States of any item that is subject to U.S. jurisdiction under this Act; or (2) any other country of any item that would be, if they were U.S. goods or technology, subject to such U.S. jurisdiction. Applies such sanctions to: (1) a foreign country, project, or entity that after January 1, 1980 has used or made preparations to use, chemical or biological weapons in violation of international law or against its own nationals; or (2) a foreign country whose government has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) waiver or termination of sanctions, and (2) congressional notification."
