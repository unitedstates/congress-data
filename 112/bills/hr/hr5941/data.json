Requires each annual report submitted by DHS's Chief Financial Officer to include a plan: (1) to obtain such unqualified opinion; (2) that addresses how DHS will eliminate material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting; and (3) to modernize the financial management systems of DHS, including consideration of alternative approaches that include modernizing existing, and establishing new, financial management systems and associated financial controls."
