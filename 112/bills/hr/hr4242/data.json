Repeals the health care provisions of the Health Care and Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010 and restores provisions of law amended by such Act's health care provisions. Revises Public Health Service Act provisions concerning health insurance coverage to require each health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage in the group market (currently, individual or group market) in a state to accept every employer and every individual in a group (currently, every employer and every individual) in the state applying for such coverage. Prohibits a group health plan or a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage from imposing: (1) any preexisting condition exclusion with respect to such plan or coverage, or (2) lifetime or annual limits. Requires dependent coverage beyond age 18 until the first of either a dependent turning 26, marrying, or no longer residing at home. Requires plans to offer catastrophic coverage and sets forth coverage requirements. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make grants to States for planning for the establishment and implementation of health insurance risk adjustment mechanisms. Sets forth provisions limiting the liability of health care providers."
