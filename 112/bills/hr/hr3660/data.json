    "text": "Contingency Operations Oversight and Interagency Enhancement Act of 2011 - Establishes as an independent entity the United States Office for Contingency Operations (Office), which shall report to the Department of Defense (DOD) and the State Department. Transfers to the Office various authorities, functions, personnel, and assets of specified federal departments and agencies. Provides for an Office Director, Deputy Director, Associate Directors, and an Inspector General. Requires the Office, among other duties, to: (1) monitor political and economic instability worldwide in order to anticipate the need for mobilizing U.S. and international assistance for the stabilization and reconstruction of a foreign country or region that is at risk of, in, or in transition from, conflict or civil strife in the wake of violence or cataclysmic disaster; (2) develop contingency plans and procedures to mobilize and deploy civilian and military personnel to conduct appropriate foreign stabilization and reconstruction operations (operations); (3) execute, administer, and enforce laws, rules, and regulations relating to the preparation, coordination, and execution of operations; and (4) evaluate, and report to Congress on, the impact of operations. Gives the Director sole control over such operations. Requires the Director to: (1) coordinate with the Secretary of Defense and commanders of unified and specified combatant commands regarding Office plans for operations, and (2) prescribe a Contingency Federal Acquisition Regulation. Establishes the Stabilization and Reconstruction Fund. Outlines duties and responsibilities of the Inspector General of the Office, including special audit and investigative authority and reporting requirements. Transfers to the Inspector General all functions vested in the Offices of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction and the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. Expresses the sense of Congress that, to the extent possible, the Director and Office staff should partner with the country in which an operation is taking place, other foreign government partners, international organizations, and local nongovernmental organizations throughout the planning, implementation, and particularly during the transition stages of such operations, in order to facilitate long term capacity building and sustainability of initiatives."
