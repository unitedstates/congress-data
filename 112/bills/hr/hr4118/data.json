    "text": "Small Business Procurement Improvement Act of 2012 - Amends the Small Business Act to require (under current law, permit) federal agencies involved in procurement, to the maximum extent practicable, to include small businesses in multiple award contracts. Requires such agencies to make full use of the contract set-aside programs of the Small Business Administration (SBA). Directs the SBA Administrator, in consultation with the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) and any agency that obtains 5% of its procurement requirements through a multiple award contract, to carry out a program to increase small business participation in such contracts. Requires the President to annually establish government-wide goals for the total value of all task and delivery orders placed against multiple award contracts, blanket purchase agreements, and basic ordering agreements awarded to small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small businesses owned and controlled by women. Requires each federal contract for the purchase of goods and services with an anticipated value greater than $2,500 but not greater than $200,000 (under current law, $100,000) to be reserved exclusively for small businesses (with an exception). Directs the Administrator to issue regulations concerning General Services Administration (GSA) oversight of task or delivery orders placed against multiple award contracts. Requires: (1) inclusion of the Administrator on the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, and (2) the OFPP Administrator to have the deciding vote in case of a tie vote among Council membership."
