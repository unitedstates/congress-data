Extends through such date the prohibition against receipt by a senior executive or senior-level employee of any increase in the rate of basic pay absent a change of position that results in a substantial increase in responsibility or a promotion. Applies the pay limit freeze to Members of Congress. Declares that no statutory COLA for a legislative branch employee which would otherwise take effect during the period beginning on enactment of this Act and ending on December 31, 2013, shall be made."
