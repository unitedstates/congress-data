Declares that the Bureau of Reclamation shall not be required to cease activity on such a project pending completion of a review or legal challenge of such a Notice or issuance of such a permit. Defines \"CVP\" to mean Central Valley Project and \"project\" to mean activity that: (1) is undertaken or funded by, or that requires an issuance of a permit by, a public agency; (2) has a potential to result in physical change to the environment; (3) may be subject to several discretionary approvals by governmental agencies; and (4) may include construction activities, clearing or grading of land, improvements to existing structures, and activities or equipment involving the issuance of a permit. Subjects an authorized CVP project to judicial review only in the U.S. district court for a district in which the authorized project is located. Limits the length of preliminary injunctive relief and stays pending appeal covering an authorized CVP project to 60 days, subject to renewals. Directs the court, in considering an injunction to an agency action under an authorized project, to balance the impact to the ecosystem likely affected by the project of the short- and long-term effects of undertaking the action against those of not undertaking the action."
