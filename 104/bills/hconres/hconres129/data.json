Urges the President and Secretary of State to use every diplomatic means available to ensure that the maximum allowable Hmong refugees are accepted for admission into the United States in 1995-96 and to ensure protection of the safety and human rights of the Hmong refugees in Ban Na Pho refugee repatriation camp, Sikhiu Detention Center, Phanat Nikhom refugee resettlement camp, the Buddhist temple of Wat Tham Krabok, and elsewhere in Thailand."
