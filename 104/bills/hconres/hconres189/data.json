Recognizes the efforts of the East-West Center and Pacific Islands Conference in this regard. Commends the South Pacific Commission for managerial and organizational reform and recognizes the important role the U.S. financial contribution to, and participation in, the organization makes in assisting it to realize the gradual economic self-sufficiency of all of its members. Reaffirms the U.S. commitment as a member of the Commission, a participant in the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme, and a member of the post-forum dialogue partnership with the South Pacific Forum."
