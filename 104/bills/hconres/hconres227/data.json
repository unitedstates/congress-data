Calls for NIJ: (1) to be designated as the law enforcement partner in surplus Federal property and equipment transfer programs; (2) if working with the private sector, to be authorized to waive Government patent rights and assign exclusive use of a license; and (3) to be exempted from many of the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act."
