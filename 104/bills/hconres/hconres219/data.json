Condemns proposals which would vary from this history. Calls on the Secretary of State: (1) in conjunction with our allies, to condemn proposals which would undermine the accurate interpretation of the history of the Holocaust in Croatia; and (2) to monitor the development of proposals for the Jasenovac memorial. Calls on: (1) the Government of Croatia to work in concert with internationally recognized institutions of remembrance when developing plans for the preservation of the memorial; and (2) the Chairman of the Council to study the proposals for Jasenovac, to educate the public about the dangers of denial and revisionism relating to the Holocaust, and report to the Congress on such activities."
