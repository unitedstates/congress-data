Prohibits any increases in the public debt unless a three-fifths roll call vote of both Houses enacts legislation permitting otherwise. Directs the President to submit a balanced budget to the Congress. Permits any revenue-increasing bill to become law only if approved by a majority of the whole number of each House by roll call vote. Waives these provisions when a declaration of war is in effect and when the United States is engaged in military conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security as declared by a joint resolution which becomes law."
