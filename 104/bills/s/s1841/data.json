Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 101) Outlines TEA and WF program components, providing for Federal payments to States with approved TEA and WF plans for establishing flexible statewide work-based assistance programs in the State for the following purposes. Provides under TEA for furnishing certain time-limited, conditional benefits based on work to certain eligible families with needy children (or, at the State's option, any expectant family) entering into a personal responsibility agreement with the State setting forth their particular obligations (such as cooperating with the State in the establishment of the paternity of any child born out-of-wedlock for whom assistance is claimed) in order to receive assistance and services under the TEA plan for caring for their children and securing, preferably, a full-time unsubsidized paid job in the private sector, or public sector or volunteer work if necessary, through the WF program. Grants exemptions from such time-limited benefit provision in certain hardship situations. Provides for certain sanctions for refusing to look for work, accept a bona fide offer of employment, or otherwise comply with the personal responsibility agreement. Provides under WF, among other things, for connecting appropriate TEA recipients with the private sector labor market and providing them with the education, training, and other services necessary for them to obtain private sector employment. Gives States the option of: (1) denying TEA to families having additional children while on TEA; and (2) requiring family members to undergo appropriate substance abuse treatment in order to receive TEA. Denies TEA for fugitive felons and probation and parole violators and for ten years for persons found to have fraudulently misrepresented residence in order to obtain assistance in two or more States. Provides for the exchange of certain TEA program information with law enforcement agencies under specified conditions. Lists certain requirements for State TEA plans concerning other programs, including that the State plan require that the State have in effect: (1) a plan approved under SSA title IV part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) together with a child support program in substantial compliance with such plan; as well as (2) plans under SSA title IV parts B (Child-Welfare Services) and E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) operating in substantial compliance with the requirements of such parts. Requires State TEA plans to: (1) describe the State efforts to promote family preservation and stability; and (2) require the State to have in effect a plan under its Child Care Development Block Grant Act of 1990 program. Sets forth rules for the provision of services to Native Americans and refugees. Outlines program audit, quality assurance, data collection, and reporting requirements, as well as certain study requirements. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct research on alternative approaches to operating welfare programs and related issues, such as strategies for moving welfare recipients into the workforce quickly, reducing teen pregnancies and out-of-wedlock births, and providing adequate child care. Authorizes the Secretary to implement and evaluate a variety of innovative demonstrations related to child support and other children's issues with respect to TEA clients under State plans. Directs the Bureau of the Census to expand the Survey of Income and Program Participation as necessary to obtain such information as will enable interested persons to evaluate the impact of the changes made by this title on a random national sample of recipients of assistance under State programs funded under this title and other appropriate low-income families. Provides funding for such study. Makes the HHS Assistant Secretary for Family Support the official responsible for administering these new programs (Sec. 103) Amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to provide for the collection of overpayments under the TEA program from Federal tax refunds. (Sec. 104) Amends SSA title XI to revise the limitations on Federal payments under SSA title IV part A and other specified SSA programs to the Virgin Islands and Guam, and provide for their annual adjustment for inflation according to the consumer price index. Subtitle B: Make Work Pay - Amends SSA titles XIX (Medicaid) and IV part A (TEA), as well as IRC and the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990, to make various specified changes with regard to certain program aspects, providing, among other changes, for: (1) a permanent extension of authority for transitional Medicaid benefits for former TEA recipients; and (2) notice of availability of the earned income tax credit to applicants and former recipients of TEA and Medicaid. (Sec. 113) Amends IRC to require participating residents to receive advanced earned income payments from a responsible State agency pursuant to a State Advance Payment Program in lieu of receiving earned income advance amounts from an employer. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to designate up to four State Advance Payment Demonstrations. Authorizes appropriations. Subtitle C: Work First - Amends SSA title IV to replace the current JOBS program under part F with a new WF program under which each State that operates a TEA program shall establish a WF program for getting TEA recipients off cash assistance through the use of private placement companies, microenterprise initiatives, and other specified means including subsidized jobs. Allows participating States to establish one of two types of WF programs, with one type similar to the GAIN (welfare reform) Program operated by Riverside County, California, and the other type similar to the JOBS Plus (welfare reform) Program operated by the State of Oregon. Adds a new part G (Workfare Program) (WP) under SSA title IV under which States establishing a WF program shall establish either a workfare program (with separate community service and subsidized job components) or a job placement voucher program under SSA title IV new part H (Job Placement Voucher Program) (JPVP) in order for TEA recipients eventually to secure full-time unsubsidized employment in the private sector. Requires States to provide program participants with the necessary case management services to ensure integrated benefits and services provided under such programs. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) States should target individuals who have not attained 25 years of age for participation in WF programs; and (2) the Congress intends for State activities under the JOBS Plus Program to emphasize the use of the funds that would otherwise be used to provide individuals with TEA to subsidize their wages in temporary jobs. (Sec. 124) Provides for certain increases in WF, WP, and JPVP funding amounts under specified circumstances. Subtitle D: Pregnancy and Family Stability - Amends SSA title IV part A with respect to teenage pregnancy and promoting family stability to require generally certain adult supervised living arrangements for any individual under age 18 who has never married and who has a needy child in his or her care (or is pregnant and is eligible for TEA) in order for such individual to receive such assistance (where possible, from his or her parent, legal guardian, or other adult relative on such individual's behalf). Requires completion of high school or other educational training for certain teenage parents required to participate in WF. Gives States the option to provide additional specified incentives and penalties to encourage teen parents to complete high school and participate in parenting activities. (Sec. 132) Amends SSA title XX (Block Grants to States for Social Services) to direct the HHS Secretary to establish a National Clearinghouse on Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Programs for the collection and provision of programmatic information and technical assistance that relates to adolescent pregnancy prevention programs. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 134) Allows States to use available Federal funds for the establishment, operation, and support of second chance group homes for custodial parents under age 18 (or age 19, at the option of the State) and their children. Requires that the HHS Secretary, after appropriate consultations, submit recommendations to the Congress with regard to which Federal surplus properties may be used for the establishment of such second chance homes. Title II: Child Support Enforcement - Subtitle A: Eligibility for Services; Distribution of Payments - Amends part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of SSA title IV to require State plans for child and spousal support to provide: (1) certain services relating to paternity establishment or enforcement of child support obligations; and (2) continuation of services for families ceasing to receive TEA.

Permits the linking of local registries. (Sec. 212) Requires State plans to include a centralized, automated unit for the collection and disbursement of support payments. Permits the unit to be established by linking local disbursement units through an automated information network if the Secretary agrees that it will not cost more or take more time to establish or operate than a centralized system. (Sec. 213) Requires State plans to: (1) provide for a State-operated and automated State Directory of New Hires containing prescribed information furnished by employers on new personnel; and (2) transmit such information to the National Directory of New Hires established under this title. (Sec. 214) Requires States to have statutorily prescribed procedures: (1) for mandatory income withholding for support payments subject to enforcement; and (2) under which wages of a person with a support obligation imposed by a child support order issued before October 1, 1996, shall become subject to withholding if arrearages occur, without the need for a judicial or administrative hearing. Revises the procedural guidelines for income withholding for child support enforcement. (Sec. 215) Requires the States to have statutorily prescribed procedures to ensure that Federal and State agencies conducting income-withholding activities have access to State locator systems for motor vehicle or law enforcement purposes. (Sec. 216) Revises the Federal Parent Locator Service to provide for additional information which may be transmitted to locate individuals and assets for purposes of: (1) establishing parentage; (2) establishing, setting the amount of, modifying, or enforcing child support obligations; and (3) enforcing child custody or visitation orders. Directs the HHS Secretary to establish in the Federal Parent Locator Service an automated Federal Case Registry of Child Support Orders and an automated National Directory of New Hires. (Sec. 217) Requires States to have statutorily prescribed procedures requiring recordation on such documents of the Social Security number of: (1) specified driver's, marriage, and occupational, and professional license applicants; (2) individuals subject to certain domestic relations orders; and (3) deceased persons (on death records).

(Sec. 233) Requires State plans for child and spousal support to provide that the State agency administering the plan will make a determination as to whether a program recipient is cooperating in good faith with State efforts to establish paternity and secure support. Subtitle E: Program Administration and Funding - Directs the Secretary to develop a new incentive system to replace the current one. Revises the guidelines for Federal performance-based incentive payments to the States for effective child support enforcement programs. (Sec. 242) Requires a State plan for child and spousal support to include prescribed procedures for State reviews and audits. Revises the guidelines for Federal evaluation and audit of State programs governing paternity, child and spousal support, and parent location.

(Sec. 264) Requires a State plan for child and spousal support to have in effect the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act of 1981, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act of 1984, or a similar law, as well as certain procedures governing the voiding of fraudulent transfers by a child support debtor.
