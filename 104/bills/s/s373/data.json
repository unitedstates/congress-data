Title II: State Solid Waste Management Plans - Sets forth as the objective of this title the reduction of solid waste generated and disposed of prior to the year 2015 by requiring States to develop programs which: (1) reduce the generation of solid waste, encourage resource conservation, and meet other specified objectives; and (2) facilitate the recycling of, and the use of valuable resources from, such waste. Requires State waste management plans to: (1) identify the quantities, types, sources, and characteristics of solid wastes that are expected to be generated within, transported to, or managed by, the State during each of the 20 years following 1995; (2) ensure the availability of capacity to manage waste in an environmentally sound manner; (3) provide for annual certifications to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency with respect to meeting objectives and capacity to manage waste; (4) provide that all solid waste management facilities in the State meet Federal and State laws and allow only registered facilities to manage waste; (5) provide for technical and financial assistance to local communities to meet plan requirements; and (6) specify the conditions under which the State will authorize the acceptance of solid waste from other States. Title III: Interstate Transport of Waste - Authorizes a State with an approved solid waste management plan to prohibit or restrict the importation of solid waste from another State for management purposes (other than transportation). Permits States to levy fees on solid waste. Requires at least 50 percent of such fees to be allocated to the local government managing the waste. Title IV: Financial Assistance - Authorizes appropriations for: (1) assistance to States and local and regional authorities for developing and implementing solid waste management plans; (2) grants to States to encourage recycling and resource recovery and conservation; and (3) assistance to rural communities for solid waste management."
