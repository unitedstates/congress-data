Requires States that receive level of effort grant payments to deposit all payments into the revolving funds. Makes eligible for such grants States that have deposited more than the required matching amount into the revolving fund or into a non-Federal revolving fund or grant program that is subject to requirements similar to those for the State revolving fund. Prohibits States from receiving a grant in an amount greater than 20 percent of the amount of funds reserved."
