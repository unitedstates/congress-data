Defines a rural health care provider telemedicine network as a network of providers that serves physicians, clinics, and other nontertiary care providers in a health professional shortage or underserved rural area who have entered into agreements with a multispecialty tertiary care provider regarding patient referral and transfer, the use of joint communications systems, and the provision of emergency and nonemergency transportation among the network members. Requires the Secretary to make payments from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund, according to a specified methodology, for physicians' services consisting of a professional consultation with an individual or entity furnishing a service for which payment may be made to a Medicare beneficiary in a rural area, notwithstanding that the consulting individual is not at the same location as the individual furnishing the service to the beneficiary. Sets forth criteria for selecting project participants. Authorizes appropriations."
