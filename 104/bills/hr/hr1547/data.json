Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to develop a system for release to the public of information regarding where animals used for experimentation were obtained. Directs the Secretary of Defense to submit to the Congress an annual report on the animal experimentation programs of the Department of Defense, including in-depth profiles of animal research conducted at each Department facility. Requires the initiation of alternative research methods which would phase out and reduce the use of animals in Department research. Directs the Secretary to appoint an ombudsman for animal issues at each Department research facility. Requires an annual report to the Secretary of Agriculture. Directs the President to appoint a panel of biomedical and animal care experts to investigate the animal use and care programs of the Department."
