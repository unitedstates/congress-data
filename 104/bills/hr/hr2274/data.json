Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to submit to specified congressional committees for approval a proposed modification of the NHS, subject to specified requirements, which shall take effect only if a law has been enacted approving such modification. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) initial proposed modifications to the NHS; (2) congressional high priority corridors; and (3) interim eligibility for Federal highway funds. Title II: Highway Funding Restoration - Highway Funding Restoration Act of 1995 - Directs the Secretary to allocate among the States specified amounts for Interstate highway substitute, NHS, surface transportation program, Interstate, congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program, bridge, hazard elimination, and rail- highway crossings projects (State High Priority Project Restoration Program, hereinafter referred to as the High Priority Program) for FY 1996 and 1997. Specifies allocation percentages by State. Provides that such allocations shall not affect a State's minimum allocation of Federal-aid highway funds or specified allocations under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA). Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the period of availability; (2) a special rule for the obligation of allocations in urbanized areas with a population of over 200,000; and (3) limits on planning expenditures. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 204) Rescinds funds from various previously authorized projects and from unobligated balances of funds previously made available and derived from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). Reduces the authorized funding levels for certain programs (regarding magnetic levitation and highway safety) funded from the HTF. Transfers certain funds (regarding the Congestion Pricing Pilot Program) derived from the HTF made available for such fiscal years to carry out the High Priority Program. (Sec. 205) Directs the Secretary: (1) to notify each State of the total amount of the reduction in authorized funds for FY 1996 that would have been allocated and apportioned to such State, as a result of specified ISTEA provisions; and (2) in determining such amount, to deduct the amount allocated to each State in FY 1996 pursuant to the High Priority Program and certain other amounts available for FY 1996. Requires: (1) each State to designate on or before November 1, 1995, or as soon as possible thereafter, unobligated balances of funds apportioned or allocated on or before September 30, 1995, and which are subject to the obligation ceiling, that may be made available for any purpose currently eligible under the Minimum Allocation Program; and (2) the Secretary to make such funds available to the States before November 15, 1995, or as soon as possible thereafter. Prohibits unobligated balances of funds attributed to urbanized areas with a population of over 200,000 from being designated by the State without the concurrence, in writing, of the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) designated for such area. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) congestion mitigation and air quality balances; (2) interstate construction balances; (3) periods of availability; and (4) limits on statutory construction. (Sec. 206) Revises provisions regarding the method of distribution of funds made available under the Minimum Allocation Program in FY 1996 and 1997.

(Sec. 207) Prohibits the Secretary from penalizing States for failure to implement various highway and transportation management systems during FY 1996. Repeals a requirement that States meet minimum utilization requirements for asphalt pavement containing recycled rubber and the penalties for failure to meet those requirements. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Directs the Secretary to distribute the limitation imposed on transit operating assistance so that: (1) each urbanized area that had a population of less than 200,000 under the 1990 decennial census will receive for each of FY 1996 and 1997, 75 percent of the amount the area received under such distribution for FY 1995; and (2) an urbanized area that had a population under the 1980 decennial census of more than one million and has a population under the 1990 decennial census of less than one million will receive under the distribution of such limitation for each of FY 1996 and 1997, 90 percent of the amount of funds apportioned in FY 1982 under specified provisions of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 to such area. Requires the Secretary, in the distribution of such limitation to urbanized areas that had a population under such census of one million or more, to direct each such area to give priority consideration to the impact of reductions in operating assistance on smaller transit authorities operating within the area and to consider the needs and resources of such authorities when the limitation is distributed among all transit authorities operating in the area. (Sec. 302) Directs the Secretary to: (1) require each recipient of Federal financial assistance for a highway or transit project with an estimated total cost of $1 billion or more to submit to the Secretary an annual financial plan, which shall be based on detailed annual estimates of the cost to complete the remaining elements of the project and on reasonable assumptions (as determined by the Secretary) of future increases in the cost to complete the project; (2) make a recommendation to the Congress on whether or not future Federal assistance should be withheld regarding any such project for which an annual financial plan is not submitted or for which the Secretary determines that the estimates or assumptions are not reasonable; and (3) submit to the Congress an annual report on the financial plans submitted and any such recommendation. (Sec. 303) Prohibits the Secretary of Transportation, after this Act's enactment and before the date on which Federal-aid highway and transit programs are reauthorized, from issuing a letter of intent, or entering into a full financing grant agreement or early systems work agreement for a project or operable segment of a project unless the full amount of Federal financial responsibility for the project or segment has been included in an authorization law.
