    "text": "Emergency Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1996 - Reinstates the emergency unemployment compensation (EUC) program. Amends the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1991 to: (1) repeal the February 5, 1994, termination of the emergency unemployment compensation (EUC) program; and (2) extend the authorization for new claims for benefits under the program until six months after the enactment of this Act. Modifies the final phase-out period for continuation of claims. Provides for a similar extension of the program of temporary extended railroad unemployment insurance benefits (and modification of the phase-out period). Authorizes appropriations and the use of advance account funds to carry out the extension of the EUC program. Designates all direct spending amounts provided and all appropriations authorized by this Act as emergency requirements for purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act)."
