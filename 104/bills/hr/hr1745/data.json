Provides for continuation of existing grazing on such lands. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect Utah's jurisdiction of fish and wildlife management, including water development and predator control. States that the Congress does not intend these wilderness designations to lead to creation of buffer zones.

Prescribes footages for the use of roads and rights-of-way as wilderness boundaries and prohibits closure of roads except in specified circumstances. Provides for reasonable access to wilderness-enclosed facilities and lands. (Sec. 4) States that nothing in this or any other Act shall be to construed to constitute Federal reservation of water or water rights for any purpose arising from designation of the areas as wilderness. (Sec. 5) Requires the Secretary of the Interior to : (1) be responsible for the protection and interpretation of cultural, archaelogical, and paleontological resources within the areas designated as wilderness by this Act; and (2) assure nonexclusive access to Native American sites for traditional cultural and religious purposes, including wood gathering and plant collecting. (Sec. 7) States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to restrict low-level overflights over the designated areas or to require the removal of existing communication or tracking systems. (Sec. 8) States that the Congress does not intend these wilderness designations to lead to reclassification of any airshed to a more stringent Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) air quality classification. (Sec. 9) Sets forth specified disclaimers regarding interpretation of this Act. (Sec. 10) Requires those areas in Utah administered by the Secretary which are not designated as wilderness to be managed for multiple use.
