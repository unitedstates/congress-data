    "text": "Temporary Duty Suspension Act - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to authorize the administering authority to suspend for up to one year the imposition of antidumping or countervailing duties with respect to a product if such authority determines that prevailing market conditions relating to the availability of such product in the United States make the imposition of such duties inappropriate. Requires potentially affected parties to be given an opportunity to comment before a suspension takes effect. Authorizes the extension of such suspensions for additional periods of up to one year each. Allows the reinstatement of such duties upon a finding of an insufficient basis for continuance of their suspension."
