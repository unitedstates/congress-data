Repeals provisions authorizing a Member of the House from transferring amounts from his or her Official Expenses Allowance and Clerk Hire Allowance to his or her Official Mail Allowance. Prohibits any: (1) Member of Congress from sending any unsolicited franked mail postmarked fewer than 60 days immediately before any primary or general election in which such Member is a candidate; and (2) Representative who is a candidate for any other public office from sending unsolicited franked mail outside his or her congressional district. Defines \"unsolicited mailing\" as all mail other than mail that is: (1) in direct response to a communication from a person to whom the matter is mailed; (2) from a Member of Congress to other Members; (3) of a news release to the communications media; or (4) in furtherance of the administrative duties of the Members of Congress. Requires the Clerk of the House to include (by separate category) the costs relating to franked, first class mass mailings in the statement made available to the public concerning the costs charged against the Official Mail Allowance for each person entitled to use the congressional frank."
