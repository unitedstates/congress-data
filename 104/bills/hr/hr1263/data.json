    "text": "Abandoned and Medically Fragile Infants Assistance Act of 1995 - Authorizes grants to develop, implement, and operate projects and programs to: (1) prevent, and provide services regarding, abandonment of infants; and (2) prevent medical neglect of, and provide services regarding, disabled infants with life-threatening conditions. Defines \"abandoned\" to mean infants and young children medically cleared for hospital discharge but remaining hospitalized because of a lack of appropriate out-of-hospital placement alternatives. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 to replace the definition of \"boarder baby\" with references to the definition of \"abandoned\" under this Act."
