(Sec. 5) Increases to $6,000 the amount authorized to be paid by the Secretary for the purchase of an automobile or adaptive equipment for certain disabled veterans. (Sec. 6) Extends through December 31, 1997, the authorized period for a program providing vocational training for certain veterans' pension recipients. (Sec. 7) Increases from one to two years the period for which accrued but unpaid periodic monetary benefits payable to a veteran or the veteran's spouse or dependents shall be paid to the appropriate survivors.
