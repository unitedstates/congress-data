Requires the payment of certain fees with such proposal. Outlines proposal contents, including the requirement of a plan and estimated cost comparable to those included in preauthorization reports required for a Federal reclamation project. Directs the Secretary to require each project sponsor to contribute toward the cost of a project at least 25 and no more than 40 percent of total project costs. Provides various time limitations with respect to proposal determinations. Limits loan terms to no less than 15 and no more than 25 years, unless agreed to by both parties. (Sec. 106) Outlines contract terms and conditions, to be negotiated by the Secretary, upon approval of any project proposal. Authorizes the head of any Federal department or agency to make available to the project sponsor any appropriate information and material useful to the planning, design, construction, or operation and maintenance of the project concerned. Requires project planning and construction to be in compliance with the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act. (Sec. 111) Authorizes appropriations for FY 1998 through 2007. Title II: Small Reclamation Water Resources Partnership Program - Establishes within the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation the Small Reclamation Water Resources Management Partnership Program for a small grant and loan program. Limits grants to $5 million for a single project, to be matched on a 50-50 basis. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1998 through 2002 for such loans and grants. Limits loans to $1.5 million per project, requiring them to be repaid within a five-year period into a revolving loan fund to be established in the Treasury. (Sec. 204) Makes the following activities eligible for grants or loans under this title: (1) water conservation; (2) fish and wildlife enhancement; (3) public safety; (4) public outdoor recreation; and (5) archaeological surveys. Authorizes the Secretary to add to such list as considered appropriate, requiring 60 days' prior notice and publication of the proposed additions. Requires each applicant to submit a Notice of Intent to the appropriate Regional Director of the Bureau outlining the proposed project and public benefits thereof. Requires the Regional Director to approve or reject such application within 90 days. Outlines required contents of project proposals.
