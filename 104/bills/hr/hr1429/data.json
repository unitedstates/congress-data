    "text": "Veterans' Readjustment Counseling Service Amendments of 1995 - Includes a Readjustment Counseling Service (RCS) as part of the Veterans Health Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Prohibits the Secretary of Veterans Affairs from altering or revising the organizational structure of RCS until the Secretary has notified specified congressional committees and 60 days have elapsed since such notification. Requires RCS budget information to be included annually in the President's budget submitted to the Congress. Outlines eligibility requirements for one of the Assistant Under Secretaries for Health in the Department, including at least three years of clinical experience and two years of administrative experience in RCS or other comparable mental health care counseling service. Makes such a qualified person the director of RCS. Increases from eight to nine the authorized number of Assistant Under Secretaries for Health. Directs the Secretary to furnish readjustment counseling to any veteran who: (1) served on active duty during the Vietnam era; or (2) served on active duty in a theater of combat during a period of war (currently, only after May 7, 1975) in any area in which hostilities occurred. Authorizes the Secretary to furnish such assistance to any other veteran upon request. Directs the Secretary to provide counseling to survivors and dependents of members of the armed forces killed while performing such duty. Allows the Secretary to provide such counseling to the survivors and dependents of other members killed during active duty or from a condition incurred in or aggravated by such service. Establishes in the Department the Advisory Committee on the Readjustment of Veterans to perform advisory services with respect to veterans' readjustment, taking into special account Vietnam era veterans. Requires specified reports from the Advisory Committee and the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to report to the congressional veterans' affairs committees: (1) a plan for the expansion of the Vietnam Veteran Resource Center program; and (2) on the feasibility and desirability of the collocation of Vet Centers and outpatient clinics of the Department as current leases for such centers and clinics expire. Directs the Secretary to carry out and report to the Congress on a pilot program for the provision of health-related services to eligible veterans at readjustment counseling centers."
