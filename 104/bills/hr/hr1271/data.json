Exempts from this prohibition: (1) the seeking of information for the purpose of a criminal investigation or adjudication; (2) any inquiry made pursuant to a good faith concern for the health, safety, or welfare of an individual minor; (3) administration of the immigration, internal revenue, or customs laws of the United States; or (4) the seeking of any information required by law to determine eligibility for participation in a program or for receiving financial assistance. Exempts from such prohibition as well any tests intended to measure academic performance except to the extent that questions in such tests would require a minor to reveal information proscribed by this Act. Prescribes agency notice and compliance requirements. States that this Act does not apply to any program or activity which is subject to the General Education Provisions Act."
