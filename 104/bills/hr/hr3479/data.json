Prohibits: (1) distribution of promotional material encouraging alcohol consumption; (2) distribution of free alcohol; and (3) sponsorship or public support of any on-campus athletic, musical, cultural, or social program, event, or competition by any alcoholic beverage company or by any group of companies. Requires that identification, referral, or treatment of students and employees under such programs not jeopardize the their matriculation status or employment. Authorizes grants to institutions or consortia, and contracts with such institutions and other organizations, for programs of prevention and education (including treatment-referral) to reduce and eliminate the illegal use of drugs and alcohol and associated violence. Allows using the contracts for a higher education center for alcohol and drug abuse prevention to provide training, technical assistance, evaluation, dissemination, and associated services and assistance to the higher education community and higher education institutions. Mandates ten National Recognition Awards annually to institutions that have developed and implemented effective alcohol and drug abuse prevention and education programs. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Deductions for Alcohol Advertising or Promotion - Alcohol Promotion and Advertising Tax Fairness Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to disallow a deduction for the expense of advertising (via any means) or promoting any alcoholic beverage. Title III: Promotion of Alcoholic Beverages - End Taxpayer Promotion of Alcohol Overseas Act - Amends the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 to prohibit the use of funds for overseas promotion of alcoholic beverages. Title IV: Children and Alcohol Advertising - Children's Protection from Alcohol Advertising Act of 1996 - Prohibits advertising or promoting alcoholic beverages on any audio tape, audio disc, videotape, video arcade game, computer game, or film. Prohibits outdoor advertising of alcoholic beverages within 1000 feet of any school, playground, or other public facility where individuals under 21 are reasonably expected to convene. Restricts alcohol print advertising in publications with an under-21 readership of 15 percent or more than two million to text only in black and white print. Limits alcohol television broadcast advertising between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. to a picture of the beverage with factual, objective audio information. Mandates criminal fines and allows injunctions. Requires that alcohol manufacturers sponsoring events be identified in the corporate (not brand) name. Prohibits manufacturing or distributing non-beverage products with an identifiable brand of an alcoholic beverage manufacturer (but allows the corporate name). Title V: Alcohol Advertising - Alcohol Advertising Accountability Act of 1996 - Mandates: (1) an annual report to the Congress on alcohol advertising, its profile, and its effects, along with recommendations for legislation; and (2) establishment of a panel to assist in gathering information for the report. Title IV: Health Warnings - Sensible Advertising and Family Education Act - Declares it to be an unlawful or deceptive act under the Federal Trade Commission Act to advertise any alcoholic beverage through magazines, newspapers, brochures, promotional displays, radio, television (including cable, paid per view, or subscription), or other electronic means, unless the advertising includes one of specified health warnings. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to maintain toll free numbers referred to in some of the warnings. Title VII: Ingredient Labeling for Malt Beverages, Wine, and Distilled Spirits - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to deem a malt beverage, wine, or distilled spirit mislabeled unless it bears a label disclosing: (1) the alcoholic content; (2) the number of drinks (defining \"drink\" as .6 ounces of alcohol); (3) its ingredients and calories; (4) the common name of each ingredient, including additives; and (5) a toll-free number for help with a drinking problem. Authorizes appropriations for the toll-free number."
