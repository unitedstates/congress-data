Prohibits, with respect to FY 1995 and 1996, obligating or expending foreign assistance for Russia unless the President certifies to the Congress that the Russian Government has: (1) ceased its military offensive in Chechnya and is committed to resolving the status of Chechnya through negotiations; and (2) provided a full accounting of the espionage activities of Aldrich Ames and has reimbursed the United States for amounts paid to Rosario Ames since her arrest. Requires the President and the Comptroller General to report to the Congress for each fiscal year: (1) the amount of foreign assistance provided to Russia for the preceding fiscal year; (2) a detailed accounting of the amount of foreign assistance appropriated which has not been expended and its status; and (3) an estimate of the total amount of capital exported from Russia during the previous fiscal year and an analysis of reasons for such export.
