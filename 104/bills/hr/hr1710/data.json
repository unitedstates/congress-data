Authorizes the court or magistrate judge to issue the order upon finding that: (1) such information is necessary for the conduct of an authorized foreign counterintelligence investigation; and (2) there are specific and articulable facts giving reason to believe that the consumer is a foreign power or a person who is not a U.S. person and is an official of a foreign power, or is an agent of a foreign power and is engaging in or has engaged in international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities that involve a violation of U.S. criminal statutes. Specifies that such an order shall not disclose that it is issued for purposes of a counterintelligence investigation. Sets forth provisions regarding CRA furnishing of identifying information respecting a consumer, court orders for disclosure of consumer reports, confidentiality, payment of fees, limits on dissemination, reporting requirements, damages and disciplinary actions for violations (with a good faith exception), and injunctive relief.

(Sec. 306) Makes the statutory exclusionary rule concerning intercepted wire or oral communications inapplicable to the disclosure by the United States in a criminal trial or hearing or before a grand jury of the contents of a wire or oral communication or evidence derived therefrom if any law enforcement officers who intercepted the communication or gathered the evidence acted with the reasonably objective belief that their actions were in compliance with Federal criminal code provisions. (Sec. 308) Grants temporary emergency wiretap authority involving terrorist conspiracies and expanded authority for multipoint wiretaps.

Authorizes the Attorney General to pay rewards and receive from any department or agency funds for the payment of rewards to any individual who provides any information unknown to the Government leading to the arrest or prosecution of any individual for Federal felony offenses. Requires the Attorney General to give notice to the Senate and House of Representatives if the reward exceeds $100,000. Makes the Attorney General's decision whether to authorize an award unreviewable. Sets forth provisions regarding protection of the identity of the recipient of a reward or of the members of the recipient's immediate family. Bars any officer or employee of any governmental entity from receiving a reward for conduct in performance of official duties.

Requires the Chief Justice of the United States to publicly designate five district court judges to constitute a court with jurisdiction to conduct all special removal proceedings. Makes provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 applicable to proceedings under this title. Directs the special removal court to provide for the designation of a panel of attorneys, each of whom has a security clearance and has agreed to represent permanent resident aliens with respect to classified information.
