    "text": "White Collar Reform Act - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to exempt from its wage requirements employees whose rate of annual compensation, including specified elements, is at least $40,000. Revises requirements for exemptions based on an employee's administrative capacity to provide that the determination of whether such capacity is bona fide shall not take into consideration the relationship between an employee's job duties and the management policies or general business operations of the employer or the employer's customers. Prohibits, in determining whether the employee is exempt, consideration: (1) of the fact that an employee is subject to deductions in pay for absences of less than a full day or of less than a full pay period, when there has not been an actual reduction in pay for the pay period; and (2) of the payment of overtime compensation or other additions to compensation based on hours worked in excess of a daily or weekly amount."
