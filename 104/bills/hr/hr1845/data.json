    "text": "Boxing Safety, Retirement, and Retraining Act of 1995 - Establishes the Professional Boxing Corporation and a Professional Boxing Advisory Board. Includes among the functions of the Corporation: (1) providing a national computer database resource for boxing information; (2) licensing boxers, judges, and referees, certifying the registration of promoters, matchmakers, managers, trainers, physicians, and cut men, and charging licensing and registration fees (to be deposited into the Professional Boxing Corporation Trust Fund established by this Act); and (3) establishing regulations and standards for boxing equipment, contracts, the telecasting of matches, a life, pension, accident, and health insurance fund, and for the health and safety of boxers. Authorizes the Corporation to prohibit the holding of a boxing match not in compliance with such standards and regulations and to bring a civil action to enjoin any acts or practices in violation thereof. Prohibits the Corporation from promoting boxing events or ranking professional boxers. Permits: (1) a State or local agency to continue to exercise regulatory functions that are not inconsistent with this Act and to enforce requirements that exceed the minimum requirements promulgated by the Corporation; and (2) a majority of State boxing authorities to submit a petition requesting the Congress to delay or repeal this Act because the State authorities have established an organization to carry out its purposes."
