Congress Act - Title I: Congressional Compensation - Applies existing Federal law regarding special accrual rates for Members of Congress and congressional employees under the Civil Service and Federal Employees' Retirement Systems only with respect to congressional service performed before the beginning of the 105th Congress. Eliminates the automatic cost of living adjustment for that portion of an annuity of a Member that is based solely on service as a Member. Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to: (1) eliminate automatic pay adjustments for Members until otherwise provided under the Federal Salary Act of 1967; and (2) require a recorded vote on any pay adjustment for Members. Title II: Lobbying - Modifies the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to: (1) increase from one to two years after leaving office the period of time during which a Member or employee is prohibited from engaging in certain lobbying activities; (2) include employees of a congressional committee on which a Member serves among those persons whom former Member employees may not lobby for such period; and (3) decrease the salary level of congressional employees below which lobbying restrictions do not apply. Amends rule XXXII of the Rules of the House of Representatives to deny admission to the House floor to former Members who are registered lobbyists. Prohibits such a former member from entering any Capitol dining facility or any gymnasium facility that is reserved for Members. Amends the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 to require registered lobbyists to wear identification badges when in the U.S. Capitol or in a House or Senate office building while engaged in lobbying activities. Title III: Congressional Travel - Prohibits the Secretary of Defense from providing transportation on a military aircraft for a Member unless: (1) the transportation is provided on a space-available basis as part of scheduled operations unrelated to the provision of transportation to the Member; (2) the destination, or an airfield located within a reasonable distance thereof, is inaccessible by regularly scheduled commercial aircraft flights; or (3) the transportation is the least expensive method for the Member to reach the destination by aircraft. Requires prior approval from the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct for Members and staff travelling on military aircraft to a hearing. Prohibits a retiring Member, or such Member's personal staff, from engaging in foreign travel unless such Committee determines such travel is essential to the Member's official responsibilities. Requires that any travel award that accrues by reason of official travel of a House Member, officer, or employee be used only for official travel, or by the spouse or children of that Member for travel between Washington, D.C. and that Member's district."
