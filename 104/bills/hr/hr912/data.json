Provides that the Securities and Exchange Commission shall have no jurisdiction under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 over a registered holding company or an affiliate engaged in such activities. Declares that this Act shall not prevent the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or a State commission from prohibiting the cross-subsidization of activities by a public utility company. Requires: (1) that an entity be separate from a public utility company in order to conduct activities authorized under this Act; and (2) the maintenance of separate books and records. Allows State commissions with appropriate jurisdiction to request independent audits of transactions between public utility companies and an affiliate engaging in such activities."
