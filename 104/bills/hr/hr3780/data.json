    "text": "Common Sense Hazardous Waste Facilities Siting and Permitting Act of 1996 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to add to standards applicable to hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities under the Act and under State and local law the requirement that States and local permitting authorities develop siting criteria which, at a minimum, impose restrictions on facility location: (1) within specified distances of densely populated areas or schools, churches, day care centers, or other buildings frequented by persons under age 18; (2) on or within specified distances of aquifers or recharge areas used as sources of drinking or irrigation water, bodies of water, or prime farm land (as defined in this Act); and (3) based upon environmental redlining (selection of sites predominantly on the basis of the income of residents in the surrounding area). Requires States and local permitting authorities to develop siting procedures which meet specified minimum standards concerning the application process, host community advisory committee recommendations, official consent of the host community, and a restricted appeals process."
