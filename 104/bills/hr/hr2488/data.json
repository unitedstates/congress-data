    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1995-10-17", 
    "text": "Prison Judgment Relief Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit the court from granting or approving prospective relief with respect to prison conditions unless it finds that there is a violation of a Federal right and that such relief is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to remedy the violation of such right. Directs the court, in determining the intrusiveness of the relief, to give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system. Prohibits the court, in any civil action with respect to such conditions, from granting or approving relief to reduce or limit the prison population, unless the plaintiff proves that crowding is the primary cause of the deprivation of the Federal right and no other relief will remedy that deprivation. Specifies that any prospective relief in such an action shall automatically terminate four years after the later of: (1) the date of entry of the final judgment in which the court found the violation of a Federal right; or (2) 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act. Entitles a defendant or intervenor to immediate termination of prospective relief that was approved or granted in the absence of a finding by the court that such conditions violated a Federal right. Requires the court to promptly rule on any motion to modify or terminate prospective relief in a civil action with respect to prison conditions. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) standing (Federal, State, or local officials shall have standing under specified circumstances to oppose the imposition or continuation of relief and to intervene in proceedings relating to that relief); (2) special masters; and (3) limits on attorney's fees."
