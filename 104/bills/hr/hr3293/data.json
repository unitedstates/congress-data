    "text": "Safe Drinking Water Estrogenic Substances Screening Program Act - Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to develop and, under specified conditions, implement a screening program, using appropriate validated test systems, to determine whether certain substances (including all active and inert ingredients used in registered pesticides) may have an effect in humans that is similar to an effect produced by a naturally occurring estrogen, or such other endocrine effect as the Administrator may designate. Allows the Administrator to exempt a biologic or other substance if the Administrator determines that the substance does not have any effect in humans similar to an effect produced by a naturally occurring estrogen. Requires the Administrator to order a manufacturer of a substance for which such testing is required to conduct such testing and submit results within a certain time period. Provides for suspension of the sale or distribution of the substance if the manufacturer fails to submit required information. Requires the Administrator to: (1) take such action as is necessary to ensure the protection of public health in the case of any substance that is found to have a potential adverse effect on humans; and (2) report findings and recommendations to the Congress."
