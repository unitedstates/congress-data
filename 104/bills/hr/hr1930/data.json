    "text": "Middle East Peace Compliance Act and PLO Accountability of 1995 - Declares that the Congress has determined that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) continues to disregard the commitments it has made under specified agreements with Israel. Prohibits U.S. assistance to the PLO and the Palestinian Authority until the President: (1) certifies to the Congress that they have complied with the requirements of such agreements; and (2) reports to specified congressional committees on all U.S. and international assistance provided to such entities, including any misuse of such assistance by them. Requires the President to report to such congressional committees on: (1) all the PLO's and Palestinian Authority's assets and income for the year before enactment of this Act; (2) whether the PLO is cooperating in the arrest and transfer to the United States for prosecution of PLO-connected individuals who have been responsible for terrorist attacks on specified American citizens or property since 1964; and (3) PLO steps to provide full and fair compensation to U.S. victims of PLO terrorism. Authorizes appropriations to the Attorney General to provide assistance in obtaining explosive detection devises and other counterterrorism technology to foreign countries facing terrorist attack that threatens the national interest of the United States or puts U.S. nationals at risk. Requires transmittal to Congress of all agreements, understandings, or promises, either formal or informal, connected with the implementation of the Declaration of Principles. Authorizes the President to suspend specified provisions of Federal law for renewable 90-day periods, subject to prior consultation with certain congressional committees. Prohibits any Federal agency from undertaking, or any funds from being obligated for, any activity for the establishment of a U.S. diplomatic post in any area under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority."
