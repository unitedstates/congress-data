Amber Hagerman Child Protection Act of 1996 - Amends the Federal criminal code to apply prohibitions and penalties for aggravated sexual abuse of a person under age 12 and for sexual abuse of a person between the ages of 12 and 16 to any person who: (1) crosses a State line with intent to engage in a sexual act with such minor; or (2) knowingly engages, or attempts to engage, in such an act in interstate or foreign commerce. Directs that a defendant previously convicted of another Federal offense of sexual abuse or aggravated sexual abuse of a minor or of a State offense that would have been such an offense had it occurred in a Federal prison be sentenced to life imprisonment, unless the death penalty is imposed. (Sec. 5) Requires imposition of life imprisonment upon anyone who violates provisions regarding aggravated sexual abuse (or engages in conduct that would be a violation of such provisions if the offense had occurred in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States) after previously having been convicted of another State or Federal sexual abuse offense (or conduct which would have been such an offense if the offense had occurred in such jurisdiction) if: (1) such conduct occurs in interstate or foreign commerce; (2) the defendant crossed a State line with intent to engage in the conduct; or (3) the defendant fled prosecution of such offense. (Sec. 6) James Guelff Body Armor Act of 1996 - Directs the Commission to amend sentencing guidelines to provide an appropriate sentencing enhancement for any crime of violence against a vulnerable person (including a law enforcement officer) in which the defendant used body armor. (Sec. 7) Directs the Commission to amend sentencing guidelines (and, if appropriate, policy statements) to require an enhanced sentence for a defendant convicted of committing a crime of violence against a vulnerable person while in possession of a firearm with a laser sighting device."
