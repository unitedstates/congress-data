    "text": "Fair International Standards in Trade for the Americas Act of 1995 (sic) - States that the purposes and objectives of any free-trade area trade agreement in furtherance of the proposed Free Trade Agreement for the Americas include the following principal negotiating objectives: (1) specified worker rights, standards and protection; (2) environmental quality and protection; (3) identification of the systematic denial or practical nullification of worker rights and environmental quality as unfair trade practices; and (4) a comprehensive dispute resolution process meeting specified requirements. Instructs the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to establish an interagency committee to provide technical consultation services if a multilateral commission is established for comprehensive dispute resolution. States that the President's authority to enter into free-trade area trade agreements may be exercised only if such agreements reflect the provisions of this Act."
