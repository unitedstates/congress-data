Provides for the recapture of excess amounts under certain conditions. States that this Act shall not have any effect on certain other waivers granted to Wisconsin before enactment of this Act, and that the current waivers are considered a precondition and can be subsumed as part of the Wisconsin Works demonstration. Provides that if, after enactment of this Act, any Federal law is enacted which modifies the terms of, or the amounts of expenditures permitted under, any program to which this Act applies, Wisconsin may elect to participate in such program as so modified."
