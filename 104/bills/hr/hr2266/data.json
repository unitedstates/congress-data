Prohibits Greene, Columbia, Rensselaer, and Dutchess Counties and the cities and towns therein from being included within the boundaries of the Area unless the governments of such entities agree and notify the Secretary of the Interior. Provides that the management entities for the Area shall be the Hudson River Valley Greenway Communities Council and the Greenway Conservancy (agencies established by the State of New York in its Hudson River Greenway Act of 1991). Requires the entities to jointly establish a Heritage Area Committee to manage the Area. Directs the Secretary to enter into a compact with the management entities that shall include information relating to the objectives and management of the Area. Requires the entities to develop, submit to the Secretary for approval, and give priority to actions to implement a management plan for the Area that presents comprehensive recommendations for the Area's conservation, funding, management, and development. Authorizes the Secretary: (1) at the request of the management entities, to provide technical and financial assistance to the Area to develop and implement the management plan; and (2) to spend funds directly on nonfederally owned property, especially sites listed on or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. Authorizes appropriations."
