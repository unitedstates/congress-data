    "text": "Amends the Federal criminal code to increase the penalties for using hazardous or injurious devices (e.g., tree spiking) on Federal lands. Increases the penalty imposed upon an individual who causes: (1) serious bodily harm to a maximum term of 40 years' imprisonment; and (2) bodily harm to a maximum of 20 years' imprisonment. Allows an individual: (1) who causes property damage or avoidance costs which exceeded $10,000 to be imprisoned for up to 20 years, fined, or both; and (2) punished after one or more previous violations to be imprisoned for 20 years. Authorizes an injured person to commence a civil action against the individual responsible. Grants jurisdiction to the district courts. Allows the court to award monetary damages, costs of litigation, and reasonable attorney and expert witness fees to any prevailing or substantially prevailing party. Requires the Attorney General to reimburse a local authority that incurs any costs as a result of that authority's participation or cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of such an offense."
