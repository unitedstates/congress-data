Prohibits such obligations or expenditures from being made until the Mayor of the District provides written notification (prepared by the D.C. Chief Financial Officer) to the District Council, District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority, the President, and Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and of the Senate. Limits the amount made available for obligation or expenditure for a project or activity for a fiscal year under this Act to the lowest of: (1) the amount or authority made available under the Act as passed by the House; (2) the amount or authority made available under the Act as passed by the Senate; or (3) the amount or authority provided in the previous fiscal year. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the financial condition of the District should be the primary factor in determining the amount of any Federal payment made to the District under any continuing resolution; and (2) a continuing resolution providing for such a Federal payment should be enacted before the first day of a fiscal year for which the Congress has not enacted the District's budget."
