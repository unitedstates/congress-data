(Sec. 3) Prohibits candidates for Federal office from making any loans to their campaigns. (Sec. 4) Increases the contribution limitation applicable to individuals. Decreases the limitation on multicandidate political committee contributions to be equal to the limitation applicable in the preceding. (Sec. 5) Prohibits a candidate for the office of Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, the Congress from accepting contributions from individuals other than in-State individual residents which total the same as, or in excess of, the total of contributions accepted from in-State individual residents. (Sec. 6) Limits soft money contributions and expenditures of political parties. (Sec. 7) Sets forth reporting requirements concerning political committees. Allows a State political party committee to file a State report in lieu of any report required to be filed by this Act, if the Federal Election Commission determines such reports contain substantially the same information. (Sec. 8) Modifies reporting requirements concerning soft money for election activity aggregating in excess of $2,000 disbursed or obligated by any individual other than political parties."
