    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1995-12-20", 
    "text": "Juvenile Records Act of 1995 - Revises Federal criminal code provisions regarding the use of juvenile records. Requires: (1) throughout and upon completion of the juvenile delinquency proceeding, such records to be treated in the same manner as the records of adults; and (2) the records of juveniles charged with crimes which would be felonies if committed by adults to be released in the same manner as those of adults charged with similar offenses. Repeals provisions: (1) requiring district courts exercising jurisdiction over juveniles to inform a juvenile and his or her parent or guardian of rights relating to his or her juvenile record; and (2) prohibiting making public the name or picture of a juvenile, except a juvenile who is prosecuted as an adult, in connection with a juvenile delinquency proceeding. Directs the court, whenever a juvenile has been found guilty of committing an act which, if committed by an adult, would be a felony crime of violence or other specified offense, to transmit to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Identification Division, information concerning the adjudications. (Currently, such requirement applies only after the second conviction.) Amends the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to require State plans submitted to receive Federal assistance to provide that the State will ensure that whenever, in a juvenile proceeding, a juvenile is found to have committed an act that would be criminal if committed by an adult: (1) a record is kept that is equivalent to the record kept relating to the conviction of an adult, the record is retained for an equivalent period, and the record is made available to law enforcement and school officials to an equivalent extent, with an exception; (2) the juvenile is fingerprinted and photographed and the fingerprints and photographs are retained and distributed in the same manner as those of adults so convicted; and (3) the court in which such proceeding is held transmits to the FBI the information concerning such proceeding. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to require a State to comply with such requirements within a specified time period or have its formula grants reduced by 20 percent. Authorizes the Attorney General to extend such period upon determining that the State has made a good faith effort to comply."
