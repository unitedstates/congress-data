    "text": "Shore Protection Act of 1996 - Includes as U.S. policy the prevention of damage to U.S. beaches and the promotion of shore protection projects (projects) and related research that encourages the protection, restoration, and enhancement of sandy beaches. Directs the Secretary of the Army to: (1) recommend, conduct, and report to the Congress on studies concerning projects that meet established criteria; (2) recommend to the Congress the authorization or reauthorization of projects based on study results; (3) consider the economic, ecological, local, and regional benefits of such projects; and (4) carry out the projects in coordination with any other Federal projects. Directs the Secretary to: (1) construct any project authorized by the Congress for which funds have been appropriated through a construction agreement with a non-Federal interest; (2) report annually to the appropriate congressional committees on the status of all ongoing shore protection studies and projects; and (3) reimburse non-Federal interests (currently, local interests) for work done on authorized projects (current law) or separable elements of such projects. Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1992 to require similar written agreements with non-Federal interests for shoreline projects carried out under such Act. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) cooperate with a State in the preparation of a comprehensive State or regional plan for the conservation of coastal resources; (2) encourage State participation in plan implementation; and (3) submit reports and recommendations to the Congress concerning Federal participation in such plan. Amends the Flood Control Act of 1970 to include within authorized projects shore protection projects, including beach nourishment and the replacement of sand."
