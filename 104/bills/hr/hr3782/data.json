    "date": "1996-07-11", 
    "text": "Electric Power Competition and Consumer Choice Act of 1996 - Declares the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 inapplicable to an electric utility company or any holding company of such utility if any subsidiary, associate, or affiliate of either the electric utility or the holding company has received a Certification of Competition under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) from the appropriate State regulatory authority. Amends PURPA to codify standards of competition for electric utilities. Sets forth a voluntary State certification program under which a State regulatory authority may elect to issue to a regulated electric utility over which it has ratemaking authority a State certification of compliance with standards and requirements of competition. Instructs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to establish criteria for State certification in accordance with specified Federal standards of competition, including a retail competition standard and a divestiture standard. Sets forth minimum certification requirements. Provides that upon passage of this Act: (1) no law shall be construed to preempt otherwise applicable State authority to review the prudence of any wholesale or retail cost incurred by a utility; and (2) no Federal statute shall be construed to preempt FERC authority to examine existing affiliate contracts or transactions. (Sec. 4) Amends the Federal Power Act regarding public utility mergers and acquisitions to prohibit acquisition of an interest in a public utility that results in effective control or ownership unless: (1) an arms-length relationship exists between all parties; and (2) FERC has made certain mandatory findings concerning the maintenance of effective competition and substantial electric service cost reductions. Authorizes FERC to establish conditions governing such transactions. (Sec. 5) Amends the Federal Power Act to repeal current conflict of jurisdiction requirements and prohibit any public utility or affiliate to use its ownership or control of any resource to create or maintain a situation inconsistent with effective competition in any market in which competition would benefit consumers. Delineates parameters within which FERC shall order a public utility to desist from any violation of such prohibition. (Sec. 6) Amends the Federal Power Act to instruct FERC to promulgate rules establishing tariffs applicable in the largest feasible regions within which a single transmission rate schedule is available for use by buyers or sellers of generation. Requires that such tariffs be designed, among other things, to prevent multiple transmission service charges based on the number of transmission owners rather than on actual transmission costs. (Sec. 7) Grants State regulatory bodies and FERC access to the books and records of a public utility, including its affiliates or associates."
