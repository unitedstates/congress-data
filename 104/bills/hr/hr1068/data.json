Describes eligible individuals and renal disease management services for purposes of this Act. Sets forth criteria for determining payment for renal disease management services covered, and not covered, under Medicare. Requires the Secretary to enter into a contract with an entity to monitor the project and to assess and make public the extent to which: (1) the implementation of renal disease management services produces increased job retention, preservation of meaningful and taxable income, or improvement in the quality of life; (2) such services affect the patient's functional outcome and or natural history of their kidney disease as compared to a control group; and (3) the implementation of such services has delayed the progression of renal disease and, therefore, the onset of dialysis."
