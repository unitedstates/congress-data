Modifies requirements regarding consumer lease disclosures and advertising and imposes new requirements applicable to automobile lease disclosures and advertising. Prohibits any stipulation, provision, or term of any lease from waiving a lessor's liability or depriving a lessee of any right or benefit under Federal or State law. Amends the Truth in Lending Act (title I of the CCPA) to limit the total civil liability for violation of any consumer lease provision requirement to $10,000. Mandates model disclosure forms. Requires a study and report to the Congress on the feasibility of instituting a procedure for standardizing the terms and costs of automobile leases similar to unit pricing for consumer perishable goods."
