    "text": "Small Business Export Enhancement Act of 1995 - Makes specified amounts from the Export Administration Amendments Act of 1985 for export promotion programs available to provide: (1) grants to qualified entities under the Market Development Cooperator Program to promote the export of goods and services of U.S. small businesses; and (2) assistance to U.S. small businesses to increase their participation in U.S. trade shows that bring together foreign governments seeking to buy their goods and services. Directs the International Trade Administration (ITA) to establish a grant program to provide financial support, on a shared basis, for State-run foreign trade missions designed primarily for participation by small and medium-sized businesses. (Sec. 4) Directs the ITA, in order to better promote the export of the goods and services of small- and medium-sized businesses in particular, to make it a priority to expand financial support for State-based enhancement activities by using funds otherwise available to it. (Sec. 5) Requires the heads of Federal agencies that administer controls and regulations with respect to the export of U.S. goods and services to jointly establish a plan to: (1) consolidate, and make easily accessible to small businesses that export, information regarding rules and restrictions on exports; and (2) create an outreach program to inform such businesses of such rules and restrictions and provide technical assistance for complying with them. (Sec. 6) Directs the ITA to submit to the Congress a plan to consolidate or eliminate programs that provide substantially similar export assistance services or provide such assistance to substantially similar recipients. Requires such plan to realize savings of not less than $100 million per year through improved efficiency, streamlining, and targeting of resources to sectors with high export potential."
