    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Congress that any U.S. national conducting a commercial cooperation project in Vietnam should adhere to specified principles regarding: (1) nondiscrimination in employment; (2) worker and environmental safety; (3) partnerships with businesses not controlled by the Vietnamese Government; (4) prohibitions on a military presence and political indoctrination programs on project premises; (5) freedoms of association and expression; and (6) the promotion of a full accounting of all Americans missing in action from the Vietnam conflict. Directs the Secretary of State to encourage member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to promote similar principles. Requires U.S. nationals conducting commercial cooperation projects in Vietnam to: (1) register with the Secretary and indicate whether they agree to implement such principles; and (2) report annually to the Department of State on adherence to such principles. Permits Federal agencies to intercede with a foreign government or national on behalf of such a U.S. national regarding export marketing activities in Vietnam only if such individual adheres to the principles."
