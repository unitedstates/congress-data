Directs the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with the Cheyenne River Sioux (for the North unit) and the Oglala Sioux (for the South unit) tribes to carry out planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and replacement activities at monument sites at their respective unit. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance to both tribes, as well as training and employment to tribal members in the operation and maintenance of both units. (Sec. 5) Authorizes each such tribe to acquire lands for inclusion in the North or South unit of the Park. Allows the Secretary to provide financial assistance for such purchases. Directs each tribe to manage its respective unit. (Sec. 7) Directs the Secretary to plan, design, and construct the national monuments on each Park unit after consultation with an advisory committee established under this Act. Requires the Secretary to complete and report to the Congress on feasibility studies to: (1) establish and mark the route taken by Chief Big Foot and his band from the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation to Wounded Knee as a national historic trail; and (2) establish a visitor information and orientation center on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation. (Sec. 8) Establishes the Wounded Knee National Tribal Park Advisory Commission. (Sec. 9) Authorizes either tribe or its designated agency or authority to enter into an agreement with a nonprofit corporation to raise funds from private sources to be used in lieu of, or to supplement, any Federal funds made available by appropriations for Park purposes. (Sec. 11) Authorizes appropriations."
