Specifies that nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit the States from establishing requirements for the holding of State or local elective office, nor from enacting any State law which affords the right to vote in any election for Federal office on terms less restrictive than those established by this Act. Subjects individuals who intentionally deny, or attempt to deny, any person any right secured by this Act to a fine and imprisonment of up to one year."
