    "text": "Children's Protection from Alcohol Advertising Act of 1996 - Prohibits advertising or promoting alcoholic beverages on any audio tape, audio disc, videotape, video arcade game, computer game, or film. Prohibits outdoor advertising of alcoholic beverages within 1000 feet of any school, playground, or other public facility where individuals under 21 are reasonably expected to convene. Restricts alcohol print advertising in publications with an under-21 readership of 15 percent or more than two million to text only in black and white print. Limits alcohol television broadcast advertising between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. to a picture of the beverage with factual, objective audio information. Mandates criminal fines and allows injunctions. Requires that alcohol manufacturers sponsoring events be identified in the corporate (not brand) name. Prohibits manufacturing or distributing non-beverage products with an identifiable brand of an alcoholic beverage manufacturer (but allows the corporate name)."
