Applies to the amendments made by this Act rules (from provisions relating to a 50 percent exclusion for gain from certain small business stock) relating to stock conversion, pass-through entities, transfers, and short positions. Mandates basis reductions for unrecognized gain. Treats a loss on an eligible small business investment, if the loss would otherwise be from the sale or exchange of a capital asset, as an ordinary loss."
