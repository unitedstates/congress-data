Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 to replace its mandate for a comprehensive five-year program management plan for hydrogen research with a mandate that the Secretary of Energy conduct a research and development program relating to hydrogen production, storage, transportation, and use, with the goal of enabling the private sector to demonstrate the technical feasibility of using hydrogen for industrial, residential, transportation, and utility applications. Requires a detailed progress report to the Congress, including recommendations of the Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel. (Sec. 103) Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to repeal the mandate for a renewable hydrogen energy program, effective October 1, 1998. (Sec. 104) Amends the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 to direct the Secretary to require a commitment from non-Federal sources of at least 50 percent of demonstration costs. (Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary to foster the exchange of generic, nonproprietary information and technology, developed pursuant to the Act, among industry, academia, and the Federal Government to help the United States economy attain the economic benefits of the relevant information and technology. (Sec. 106) Authorizes appropriations for FY 1996 through 2001. Title II: Fuel Cells - Instructs the Secretary to solicit proposals for projects to prove the feasibility of integrating fuel cells with: (1) photovoltaic systems for hydrogen production; or (2) systems for hydrogen production from solid waste via gasification or steam reforming. Mandates proposal evaluation on a competitive basis using peer review. Prescribes proposal review guidelines. (Sec. 202) Authorizes appropriations for FY 1997 and 1998, to remain available until September 30, 1999. Title III: DOE Scientific and Technical Program Quality - Authorizes the Secretary to appoint scientific, technical, and professional personnel on leave of absence from academic, industrial, or research institutions to work for DOE for a limited term, or on a temporary basis. Sets forth compensation guidelines."
