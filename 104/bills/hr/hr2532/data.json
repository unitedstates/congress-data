    "text": "Family Farm Empowerment Act of 1995 - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 (Act) to provide nonrecourse marketing loans through 2002 for wheat, feed grains, rice, upland cotton, and oilseeds. Requires repayment at the lower of the loan rate or the prevailing domestic market price. Authorizes marketing loan deficiency payments for producers who forgo obtaining such loans. Provides for a total acreage base for such crops. Makes conforming amendments to certain price support programs. Eliminates acreage reduction programs for wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice. Amends the Disaster Assistance Act to extend funding obligations for the cottonseed and sunflower oil export programs. Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 and the Act to suspend specified permanent price support provisions for wheat, feed grains (including silage), and oilseeds. Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to replace the three-entity rule (consideration as separate entities for limitations purposes) with a direct attribution rule (based upon ownership percentage)."
