Requires the Director to: (1) submit to specified congressional committees study conclusions and estimated Program costs; and (2) enter into an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a feasibility study regarding the establishment of a Federal earthquake insurance program modeled after the \"Write Your Own\" Program under the National Flood Insurance Program.
