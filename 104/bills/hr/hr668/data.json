(Sec. 6) Amends the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to: (1) rename the criminal alien tracking center as the criminal alien identification system; (2) specify that the system shall be used to identify and locate deportable aliens who have committed aggravated felonies; and (3) transfer the system from the Attorney General to the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. (Sec. 7) Amends Federal criminal law to: (1) bring certain alien smuggling-related crimes under the purview of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) provisions; and (2) authorize wiretaps for alien smuggling investigations. (Sec. 9) Amends the Act to expand the criteria for deportation for crimes of moral turpitude. (Sec. 10) Makes local governments eligible for specified alien incarceration reimbursement assistance under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.

(Sec. 15) States that the Congress advises the President to negotiate bilateral prisoner transfer treaties. Requires annual presidential certification that a treaty is effectively returning illegal aliens incarcerated in the United States to finish their prison term in their home country. (Sec. 16) Directs the Attorney General and the Commissioner to develop an interior (home country) repatriation program. (Sec. 17) Amends the Act to authorize deportation of nonviolent offenders prior to Federal or State sentence completion."
