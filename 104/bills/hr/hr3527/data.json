Limits the Federal share of the costs of such projects to 80 percent. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 to authorize appropriations to be used to enter agreements with Mexican border States that have established infrastructure banks to make available to them lines of credit for projects to construct Federal-aid highways which will support traffic resulting from NAFTA."
