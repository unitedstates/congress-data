Outlines issues to be addressed in such assessment, requiring a focus on programs implemented during the period beginning October 1, 1995, and ending September 30, 1999. Requires a report from the Comptroller General to the small business committees. Requires the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to convene and supervise an interagency task force on fostering commercialization of the results of projects being undertaken by small businesses through the SBIR and SBTT programs. Outlines task force duties and membership requirements. Requires: (1) public participation in task force activities; and (2) a notice and initial call for such participation by the Administrator.
