Requires that the study contain findings with respect to: (1) the role played by Fort King in the Second Seminole War; (2) identification of the historical, cultural, and archaeological material found in Fort King and the surrounding area relating to life at the time of and preceding such war; (3) the types of Federal, State, and local programs that are available to preserve and develop Fort King and the surrounding area and to make the fort and the surrounding area accessible for public use and enjoyment; and (4) the potential use of, and coordination with, Federal, State, and local programs to manage, in the public interest, the historical and cultural resources found at and around Fort King. Directs the Secretary to submit a report detailing the results of the study to the committees of jurisdiction of the House of Representatives and the Senate within 12 months.
