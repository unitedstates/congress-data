Considers the Authority to be established upon execution of the compact and an agreement between the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) and the signatories regarding the Federal share of the project's cost (agreement) and the terms and conditions related to the timing of the Bridge's transfer to the Authority. (Sec. 6) Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) governance by a board of directors (Board); (2) qualifications of Board members; (3) failure of a Capitol region jurisdiction to appoint a member; (4) personal liability of members; and (5) a residency requirement for members. (Sec. 7) Directs the Secretary, after the signatories enter into the agreement, to convey all right, title, and interest (rights) of the Department of Transportation in and to the Bridge to the Authority, subject to specified interim responsibilities. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the Authority all rights in and to such land under or adjacent to the Bridge as necessary to carry out the project. (Sec. 8) Directs the Secretary and the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration (FHA) to: (1) continue working with the parties which comprise the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge Coordination Committee (established and chaired by the FHA and comprised of representatives of Federal, State, and local governments) or with the Authority to complete, at the earliest possible date, environmental studies and documentation, planning, preliminary engineering efforts, and related work, consistent with applicable Federal law; and (2) on or before October 1, 1996, transmit to the Congress a report on the selected alternative, implementation schedule, and costs of the project, and a recommended Federal share of the project cost. (Sec. 9) Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) additional powers and responsibilities of the Authority; (2) funding; and (3) availability of prior authorizations. Repeals provisions of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 regarding authorization for bridge rehabilitation."
