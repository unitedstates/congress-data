Prohibits: (1) the knowing transmittal or attempted transmittal of indecent material to a person under age 18 (and provides penalties of up to five years' imprisonment, a fine, or both); and (2) a remote computer facility operator, electronic communications service provider, or electronic bulletin board service provider from willfully allowing another individual to transmit indecent material to a person under age 18 (and provides penalties of up to two years' imprisonment, a $10,000 fine, or both). Requires the Attorney General to report to the Congress within two years regarding the state of technology that would permit parents to block or filter the transmission of indecent material to minors."
