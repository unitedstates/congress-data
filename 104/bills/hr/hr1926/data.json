    "text": "Flag Protection Act of 1995 - Provides that each copy of the U.S. flag that is intended to be displayed as a flag and is made after the enactment of this Act shall belong to the people of the United States and shall be held in trust for them by the Government. Gives the United States a property interest in each such copy, thereby subjecting each copy to the regulatory authority of the Congress under the Constitution. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to make rules for the use and disposition of such copies that allow for the sale and transfer of the rights to possess and use them. Declares that any damage to, or destruction of, such a copy that is in violation of such rules is a depredation against U.S. property for purposes of imposing criminal penalties."
