    "text": "Directs the Chief Justice of the United States to assign three circuit court judges or justices (which may include senior judges or retired justices) to a division of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to determine whether suits brought by persons, including foreign nationals, in Federal court for compensation for services performed for the United States pursuant to a secret Government contract may be tried by the court. Requires such division to determine whether the information that would be disclosed in adjudicating the action would do serious damage to U.S. national security or would compromise the safety and security of intelligence sources inside or outside the United States. Authorizes such division, if it determines that the case may be heard, to prescribe steps that the court shall take to protect national security and intelligence sources and methods. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) assignment and terms; (2) case referrals; (3) effect of the division's determinations; (4) other judicial assignments; (5) vacancies; and (6) support services. Makes this Act applicable to claims arising on or after December 1, 1976."
