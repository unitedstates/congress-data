    "date": "1995-11-09", 
    "text": "Bottled Water Standards Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, after the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency promulgates a national primary drinking water regulation for a contaminant under the Safe Drinking Water Act, to issue a regulation for that contaminant in bottled water or make a finding that a regulation is not necessary to protect the public health because the contaminant is not present in bottled water. Specifies that such a regulation shall take effect on the date on which the final regulation of the maximum contaminant level (MCL) takes effect. Requires the relevant MCL to provide protection of public health equivalent to the MCL provided in the national primary drinking water regulation. Makes the drinking water regulation the standard for bottled water if the Secretary fails to establish a regulation."
