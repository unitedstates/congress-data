(Sec. 103) Replaces the current Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) programs under parts A and F, respectively, of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) with a single, combined program of block grants to the States for operating statewide temporary assistance (TANF) programs with certain mandatory work (subsidized or unsubsidized, public or private), employment-related education, and job training, search, and other job-related activities (required program activities) for eligible families, which are designed to prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and assist such families in forming, staying together, and ultimately becoming self-sufficient in private sector employment. Limits such families generally to no more than five years of TANF cash assistance, with certain exceptions for minor children, battered family members, and hardship situations. Requires participating States to provide vouchers to families denied cash assistance due to any other State-imposed time limits. Mandates that families include either a minor child who resides with a custodial parent or other adult caretaker relative or a pregnant individual in order to be eligible for TANF assistance. Requires, in addition, certain adult-supervised living arrangements for unmarried teenage parents and the attainment of a high school diploma or its equivalent if they did not complete a high school education. Prohibits (unless a State opts otherwise) additional TANF cash assistance for children born into families already on TANF, with certain exceptions for: (1) children born into families with no other children; (2) vouchers provided in lieu of cash benefits that are only good for State-specified goods and services suitable for child care in the particular case; and (3) children born as a result of rape or incest. Denies TANF in cases where an individual family member is a fugitive felon or a probation or parole violator, and suspends it for ten years for individuals found to have fraudulently misrepresented residence in order to obtain TANF assistance in two or more States. Requires States not disregard benefits an individual receives under a State old-age, foster care, or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) plan under SSA title XVI when determining the amount of TANF for the family of which the individual is a member. Specifies State TANF plan contents, including provisions for numeric goals for reducing illegitimacy in the State over a specified period beginning in 1996, and certain certifications by the State that it will operate child support enforcement and protection programs. Includes among criteria for Federal approval of a State program under TANF requirements for a parent or caretaker receiving TANF to engage in State-defined work once the State determines the parent or caretaker is ready to engage in work, or once the parent or caretaker has received assistance under TANF for 24 months (whether or not consecutive), whichever is earlier. Allows the States to decide in their TANF plans: (1) whether or not they intend on providing TANF to aliens; and (2) how to treat families moving interstate, while allowing them to treat such families under the rules of their former State of residence only under certain conditions. Requires a plan to contain an estimate of the number of individuals (if any) who will become ineligible for State Medicaid assistance as a result of eligibility rules changes for the new TANF-funded State program, and requires the plan to indicate the extent to which the State will provide medical assistance to such individuals. Provides for the allowable uses of quarterly family assistance grants, among other purposes, for family planning services, child care under certain State block grant programs, and meeting home heating and cooling costs of certain low income households; but prohibits their use for medical services generally. Provides for: (1) additional grants to States for reductions in illegitimate births, population increases, and State work, education, and job preparation programs; and (2) a Contingency Fund for State Welfare Programs in the Treasury for payments to eligible States. Makes applicable appropriations. Sets up a Federal loan program for State TANF programs for anti-fraud and other specified activities, making necessary appropriations. Provides for the exchange of certain TANF program information with law enforcement agencies under specified conditions.
