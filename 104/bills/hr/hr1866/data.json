Title I: Young Driver Programs - Directs the Secretary to make basic and supplemental grants to those States that adopt and implement programs for young drivers which include measures to reduce traffic safety problems resulting from young drivers. Sets forth requirements regarding: (1) eligibility for basic grants (including the establishment and maintenance of a graduate licensing program for drivers under age 18 by State grant recipients and State compliance with specified criteria concerning drunk driving and other issues); (2) eligibility for supplemental grants (including provision for readily distinguishable licenses for younger drivers, driver education, recordkeeping of serious convictions, and oversight of alcohol sales to underage drinkers); (3) program evaluation; and (4) reporting requirements. Authorizes appropriations. Title II: High Risk Drivers - Directs the Secretary to: (1) study whether additional or strengthened Federal activities, authority, or regulatory actions are desirable or necessary to improve the driver record and control systems of the States to identify high risk drivers more rapidly and ensure prompt intervention in the licensing of such drivers; (2) evaluate the future of the national information systems that support driver licensing; and (3) encourage and promote State driver evaluation, assistance, or control programs for high risk drivers."
