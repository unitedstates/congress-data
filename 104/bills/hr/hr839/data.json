Directs the President to conduct an inventory and publish in the Federal Register a list of all RRAs covered by the moratorium. Extends until February 1, 1996, any deadline for, relating to, or involving an action under a RRA respecting small business authorized or required to be taken during the moratorium period. Outlines procedures for the declaration of emergency exceptions to the moratorium. Provides appropriate relief via civil action for any non-excepted RRA taken in violation of the moratorium."
