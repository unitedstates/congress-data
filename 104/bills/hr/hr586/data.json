(Sec. 3) Prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from making a payment of such assistance to a State unless the State has in effect procedures requiring the State agency, at the time a child is removed from a home and placed in foster care under State supervision, to locate any parent of the child who is not living at the home and evaluate that parent's ability to provide a suitable home for the child. (Sec. 4) Gives States the option of deeming as adoption the placement of a child who was under State-supervised foster care with a blood relative given legal custody of the child. (Sec. 5) Prohibits the Secretary, after a five-year interim period, from making a payment of such assistance to a State unless the State requires a State agency to give preference to applications of a foster parent or caretaker relative of the child in considering applications to adopt certain foster children."
