Addresses concerns over objectionable materials on such services, sexual (including child sexual exploitation) and otherwise. Shields the service provider and user from: (1) treatment as publisher or speaker of any information provided by an information content provider; and (2) liability for good faith actions taken to restrict access to such materials. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize Federal Communications Commission regulation of the content of such services."
