    "text": "Federal Prison Reform Act of 1996 - Amends the Federal criminal code to require each Federal facility for the confinement of persons convicted of offenses against the United States, insofar as practical, to observe the standards for prisoner living space and other prison conditions that are established by recognized prison accreditation agencies. Permits such facilities to fail to meet any such standards when, in the judgment of prison officials, overcrowding, financial strain, prison size, absence of on-site facilities, or other circumstances make it necessary to do so. Sets forth specific standards that each Federal prison shall observe with respect to: (1) manual labor (requires prisoners to spend a minimum of ten hours per day, six days a week, doing manual labor); (2) chain gangs; (3) nutrition; (4) exercise; (5) limits on media; and (6) amenities."
