Prohibits the Commission from finding that a renewal is consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity unless the applicant demonstrates that: (1) the station has broadcast public service announcements concerning drug and substance abuse and treatment during each hour of its broadcasting day; and (2) the duration of such announcements equals not less than five percent of the duration of commercial advertisements during that hour. Requires the Commission to include in its annual reports to the Congress an analysis of broadcasters' progress in meeting the requirements of this Act."
