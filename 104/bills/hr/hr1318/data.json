Directs the Secretary of Education, prior to such date, to: (1) consolidate into a block grant program those programs that are administered by the Department and are appropriate for States to administer; and (2) otherwise provide for the complete elimination of the Department. Directs the Secretary to submit to the Congress: (1) a strategic plan with recommendations for legislation to carry out such elimination and block grant program, and for transfers of functions and activities to other Federal or State agencies; and (2) a report with a plan and recommendations for such transfer of programs and agencies considered appropriate for continued Federal administration to other existing departments and abolishment of unnecessary programs and agencies, and with a description of projected cost savings to the Federal Government. Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office to submit to a specified congressional committee a list of recommendations for minimizing the cost of Federal education programs through the elimination of the Department. Directs the Comptroller General to report to such congressional committee with recommendations for the most efficient means of achieving the complete elimination of the Department and the transfer of appropriate functions to other existing or successor Federal or State agencies."
