    "text": "Amends the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 to extend the authority of the Secretary of Energy to perform remedial action two fiscal years through September 30, 1998. Authorizes the Secretary to continue to operate the Cheney disposal cell in Mesa County, Colorado, for the receipt and disposal of residual radioactive material from processing sites, and of byproduct material from property near a uranium milling site in Monticello, Utah, until the cell is filled to the capacity for which it was designed, or September 30, 2023, whichever comes first. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to increase: (1) from $5.50 to $6.25 per short dry ton of byproduct material the statutory reimbursement amount, as well as aggregate amounts, paid by the Secretary for remediation costs of individual active site uranium licensees; and (2) the authorization of appropriations for such reimbursement. Excludes certain sites in States that have been certified by the Secretary to have an acceptable notification program from Federal vicinity property deed annotation requirements regarding residual radioactive materials sites. Permits the disposal of residual radioactive material from Title I sites (abandoned and inactive sites at which the wastes were generated primarily for Federal activities, for which the Federal share of costs is 90 percent) among Title II processing sites (whose cost is primarily borne by the private site owner, with a proportional Federal payment for remediation of wastes generated primarily for Federal activities)."
