    "text": "Publicly Owned Treatment Works Biological Monitoring Use Act - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require permits for discharges from publicly owned treatment works to contain terms for biological monitoring or whole effluent toxicity testing and for establishing a process to reduce the cause of such toxicity if the permitting authority determines that such discharges cause, have the potential to cause, or contribute to an in-stream excursion above a narrative or numeric criterion for whole effluent toxicity. Provides that if the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency determines that it is necessary to include biological monitoring, whole effluent toxicity testing, or assessment methods as a permit condition for publicly owned treatment works, the failure of such tests shall not result in a finding of violation."
