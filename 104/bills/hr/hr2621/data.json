Prescribes that during any period for which cash benefits or administrative expenses would not be payable from a covered benefits fund because of an inability to issue further public debt obligations due to the applicable public debt limit, such obligations held by a covered benefits fund will only be sold or redeemed for payment of: (1) such benefits; or (2) administrative expenses and only if cash assets of such fund are not available from month to month for the purpose of making such payments. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to notify each House of the Congress and the Comptroller General not less than three days before an expected sale or redemption."
