Requires each financial institution to prepare and make available to the public a written description of its lending programs and other activities designed to enhance the availability of credit in the community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods served by the institution. Amends the Consumer Credit Protection Act and the Fair Housing Act to prohibit: (1) creditors from discriminating against any applicant with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction on the basis of the racial or ethnic characteristics of the neighborhood surrounding the person's dwelling or business; (2) the Attorney General from initiating a civil enforcement action regarding matters pursuant to the Consumer Credit Protection Act except upon referral; and (3) the use of statistical data indicating a disparate impact on various classes of applicants of a creditor's credit decisions as evidence that the creditor engaged in any practice in violation of this title, unless such evidence is accompanied by additional evidence demonstrating actual discrimination and intent to discriminate."
