Precludes such recommendations from including changes relating to the payment of payroll taxes for financing the program. Provides procedures for expedited congressional consideration of recommendations. Title II: Controlling Outlays Under Medicare Program - Provides that Congress, not later than April 15 of each year, shall, in the concurrent resolution on the budget for the following fiscal year, establish a limit on total outlays to be made under the Medicare program for the fiscal year involved. Provides for the enforcement of such limits through sequestration under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act)."
