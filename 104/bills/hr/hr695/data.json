    "text": "Prison Litigation Control Act of 1995 - Revises Federal criminal code provisions regarding remedies for prison crowding. Bars a Federal court from holding prison or jail conditions unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment except to the extent that an individual plaintiff inmate proves that the conditions cause the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment of that inmate. Specifies that a condition relating to the facilities and opportunities afforded prisoners does not inflict cruel and unusual punishment unless that condition constitutes a deprivation of the minimum necessities of civilized life to an individual plaintiff inmate and the responsible officials are deliberately indifferent to that individual plaintiff inmate's deprivation. Requires that each Federal court order or consent decree seeking to remedy an Eighth Amendment violation be reopened at the behest of a defendant at a minimum of two-year intervals for recommended modification or termination. Makes this Act applicable to all outstanding court orders and consent decrees, pending and future cases, and any such reopened cases. Amends the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to repeal the sunset provision with respect to remedies for prison overcrowding."
