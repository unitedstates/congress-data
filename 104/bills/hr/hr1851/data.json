Prohibits Federal funds for Department of the Army housing unless it is protected by hard-wired smoke detectors by the earlier of the date of occupancy by the first Federal employees who were not occupants as of October 25, 1992, or October 25, 1998. Permits successor fire safety standards to be used as guidelines in addition to National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 74, NFPA Standard 13 or 13-R, or NFPA Standard 101 (Life Safety Code) for installation of hard-wired, single-station smoke detectors or automatic sprinkler systems in: (1) places of public accommodation affecting commerce; and (2) federally-assisted buildings. Requires the Administrator of the U.S. Fire Administration to report to the Congress: (1) at least 60 days in advance on the termination or transfer to a private sector entity of any significant function of the Administration; and (2) on the manner in which the Administration intends to implement the budgetary reduction represented by the difference between the amount appropriated to it for FY 1996 and the amount requested in the President's FY 1996 budget request."
