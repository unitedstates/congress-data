    "text": "Food and Dietary Supplement Consumer Information Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) to replace provisions relating to dietary supplement labeling exemptions with provisions declaring that, if the labeling or advertising for a food or dietary supplement contains a claim or other information characterizing the relationship of the food or supplement (or the presence or absence of any substance in the food or supplement) to a disease or health-related condition, the food or supplement may not be deemed adulterated or misbranded if the claim or information is truthful and not misleading. Repeals provisions regulating the circumstances under which a food is deemed misbranded regarding dietary supplements and health-related claims. Revises the definition of \"dietary supplement\" with regard to the circumstances in which a new drug, antibiotic, or biologic is included in the definition. Repeals provisions relating to new dietary ingredients. Removes provisions deeming a food adulterated if it contains a new dietary ingredient for which there is inadequate safety information. Revises the definition of \"drug\" regarding the circumstances in which a food, dietary ingredient, or dietary supplement is considered a drug. Removes provisions deeming, subject to exception, a dietary supplement to be a food. Deems a food adulterated if it is a dietary supplement or contains a dietary ingredient that presents a substantial and unreasonable (currently, that presents a significant or unreasonable) risk of illness or injury. Prohibits a State or political subdivision from: (1) deeming a food or dietary supplement to be a drug or establishing any requirement as though it were a drug; or (2) deeming a food or dietary supplement adulterated, misbranded, or otherwise out of compliance with law by reason of a claim in labeling or advertising that complies with provisions of this Act. Abolishes the Commission on Dietary Supplement Labels and repeals the provisions establishing it."
