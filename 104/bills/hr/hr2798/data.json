Repeals a Federal provision which prohibits, with an exception, the Secretary from entering into a contract under which an activity at a Department health care facility currently performed by Federal employees is converted to one performed by employees of a Federal contractor. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with non-Department health care facilities and providers for the sharing of all health-care resources (currently, only specialized medical resources)."
