Authorizes appropriations. Provides for certain adjustments in Medicare payments under SSA title XVIII, removing medical education and disproportionate share hospital payments from calculation of adjusted average per capita cost. Establishes within the Department of Health and Human Services a National Advisory Council on Postgraduate Medical Education to advise the Secretary on appropriate policies for making postgraduate medical education support payments in order to assure an adequate supply of physicians trained in various specialties, consistent with the health care needs of the United States."
