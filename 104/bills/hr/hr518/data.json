    "text": "Santa Fe National Forest Boundary Adjustment Act of 1995 - Modifies and expands the boundary of the Santa Fe National Forest in New Mexico. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to exchange public lands and interests managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for private lands and interests within the Forest. Withdraws acquired lands from all public land, mining, and mineral and geothermal leasing laws. Requires the Secretaries of Agriculture and of the Interior to identify federally-owned lands and interests currently situated within the Forest which are suitable for transfer to, and administration by, BLM. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer such identified lands to BLM. Modifies the boundary of the Forest to exclude such transferred lands. Requires the lands to be managed as public lands as defined in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Requires lands acquired by the Secretaries under this Act to be added to and administered as part of the Forest in accordance with National Forests laws. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to manage such lands primarily to preserve open space and scenic values and to preclude development. Declares that nothing in this Act shall affect the authorities of the Secretary of Agriculture to acquire lands in New Mexico by purchase or exchange and that all such lands acquired by the exchange of National Forest lands shall be managed as a part of the National Forest System."
