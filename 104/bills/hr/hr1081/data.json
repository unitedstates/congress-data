    "text": "Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1995 - Amends the Shipping Act of 1984 to include as one of its purposes the promotion of growth and development of U.S. exports through competitive, nondiscriminatory, and efficient ocean transportation. Prohibits any conference or group of two or more common carriers from limiting the ability of one another from entering into or performing under a service contract. Shortens from ten calendar days to two calendar days the notice that a conference member must give the conference when taking independent action on any rate or service that is required to be filed in a tariff. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to submit to the Congress a negotiating strategy to persuade foreign governments to divest themselves of ownership and control of ocean common carriers. Requires the Federal Maritime Commission to reduce the number of its employees by a specified percentage each fiscal year. Requires it to submit to the Congress a plan for increasing the amount of its resources, including the number of Commission personnel, engaged in protecting U.S. shippers and ocean common carriers against restrictive and unfair practices of foreign governments and foreign-flag ocean common carriers."
