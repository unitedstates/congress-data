Directs the Secretary to seek to acquire by donation or exchange certain lands within the boundaries of the Park owned by Longmont, Colorado. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to pursue and report to the Congress biennially on negotiations with Longmont, Colorado, concerning the city's proposed exchange of lands located in and near Coulson Gulch for Federal lands."
