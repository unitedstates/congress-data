Requires Federal land managers to manage fossils separately from archaeological resources, cave resources, and cultural resources, but in conjunction with natural resources. Specifies the types of collecting and whether notice or permits are required. (Sec. 5) Sets forth permit terms and conditions. Allows for educational collecting permits, scientific collecting permits, and commercial collecting permits. (Sec. 6) Imposes fees and royalty payments (on the fair market value of fossils) for commercial collecting. (Sec. 7) Places ownership of collected fossils in the collector. Provides an exception for scientifically unique fossils collected commercially, making them the property of the United States. (Sec. 9) Requires the Director of the United States Geological Survey to establish a National Fossil Council to provide guidance under this Act."
