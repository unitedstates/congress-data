Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to mandate that the FDIC make amounts transferred from the SAIF available to the Financing Corporation (FICO) to cover the interest payments, issuance costs, and custodial fees on FICO obligations. Amends the FDIA to repeal the minimum assessments requirements for a deposit insurance fund risk-based assessment system. Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to include within FICO's assessment authority specified SAIF members and Bank Insurance Fund members whose deposits are treated as insured by the SAIF."
