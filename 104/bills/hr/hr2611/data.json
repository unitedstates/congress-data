Requires current navigation functions of such areas to be maintained, granting the United States an easement to such properties for such purpose. Requires an appropriate maintenance standard for each conveyee. Directs the Secretary to require that the three recipients enter into the same cooperative agreement governing the shared use and occupancy of existing Light Station facilities. Provides limitations on development and impairing uses of the property. Provides for reversion to the United States if conveyance conditions are not met."
