Requires that the Federal share of the operation and maintenance of such disposal facilities be determined in accordance with that Act. Specifies included costs. Prohibits the expenditure of the Federal share until the Secretary of the Army determines that the funds are not otherwise required to cover other eligible operation and maintenance costs assigned to commercial navigation. Limits the total Federal share for each project."
