    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to terminate the credit for large producers of ethanol used as a fuel after 1997. Disallows the credit for alcohol used to produce any ether. Exempts from tax liquids sold for use or used in an off-highway business use. Repeals the reduced rate on ethanol fuel produced from natural gas. Provides for the tax treatment of fuel alcohol in the same manner as other motor fuels. Repeals the reduced rates on alcohol fuels. Exempts partially, in the case of methanol or ethanol, the rate of tax determined under the Highway Trust Fund financing rate. Imposes a floor stock tax on fuel alcohol held by any individual on a specified date and makes such individual liable for such tax. Exempts fuel alcohol held by any individual for any use to the extent a credit or refund of the tax imposed under current law is allowed. Prohibits the imposition of tax on fuel alcohol held in the tank of a motor vehicle or motorboat and for certain amounts of fuel."
