    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "O&C Forest Transfer Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, subject to a qualifying legislative resolution of assent from the State of Oregon filed on or before December 31, 1999, to transfer to Oregon specified real property constituting the Oregon and California (O&C) Railroad Grant Lands, the Coos Bay Military Wagon Road Grant Lands, all federally owned timberlands within one or more O&C counties currently managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and certain land and structures utilized as offices or in related administrative capacities. Outlines terms required in the qualifying resolution of assent, including: (1) the requirement that Oregon manage the transferred lands for sustained yield, permanent timber production benefitting the economic stability of local communities; (2) the adoption of a State land management plan; (3) the establishment of an O&C Lands Fund for timber sales deposits and disbursements to O&C counties within the transferred lands, as well as to Oregon to cover land management costs; (4) the administration of a mineral rights program for individuals; (5) a prohibition against the sale of any transferred lands capable of timber production; (6) a reservation from entry for commercial timber production; (7) the continuation of current recreational uses; and (8) the establishment of a program providing an employment preference within the Oregon Department of Forestry in transferred land management positions to persons currently employed by the BLM in such capacity. Provides a U.S. right of reentry onto such transferred lands when the land is not being managed in accordance with the transfer conditions and such noncompliance has not been corrected within two years of such determination. Requires the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture, if a qualifying resolution of assent has been filed in a timely manner, to commence the preparation of amendments to Federal land management plans. Suspends as of January 1, 2004, specified Federal laws rendered obsolete by the land transfers under this Act."
