(Sec. 6102) Allows a marriage penalty reduction credit for qualified married couples to be determined under tables prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. (Sec. 6103) Establishes individual retirement plans (IRAs) which can be designated as American Dream Savings Accounts. Disallows a tax deduction for amounts contributed to such accounts.

(Sec. 6231) Includes in gross income excess long-term care benefits, except for terminally ill individuals. (Sec. 6232) Establishes reporting requirements for persons who pay long-term care benefits. Subtitle C: Job Creation and Wage Enhancement - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a 50 percent income tax deduction for the net capital gain of noncorporate taxpayers. Allows such deduction in computing gross income. (Sec. 6302) Requires indexing, based on the gross national product deflator, of the adjusted basis of certain assets (corporate stock and tangible property that is a capital asset or property used in a trade or business) that have been held for more than three years at the time of sale or other transfer, solely for the purpose of determining gain or loss. Allows a taxpayer, other than a corporation that holds any readily tradable stock on January 1, 1995, to treat such stock as having been sold on the last business day before such date for an amount equal to its closing market price on such last business day (and as having been reacquired on such last business day for an amount equal to such closing market price). (Sec. 6311) Reduces the alternative capital gains tax on corporations from 35 percent to 25 percent. (Sec. 6316) Allows an itemized deduction for losses arising from the sale or exchange of a principal residence.

Makes amounts in such Trust Fund available only to pay at maturity, or to redeem or buy before maturity, any obligation of the Federal Government included in the public debt. Prohibits the reissuance of any obligation which is paid, redeemed, or bought with amounts from the Trust Fund. Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to require a sequestration (reduction) of Federal spending equivalent to the aggregate amounts designated for payment to such Fund. Sets forth congressional reporting requirements. (Sec. 6351) Increases the unified credit against the estate tax and the unified credit against the gift tax and provides a cost-of- living adjustment for such credits. Provides an inflation adjustment for the alternate valuation of certain farm and business property, the gift tax exclusion, the generation-skipping tax exemption, and the estate tax on closely held businesses. (Sec. 6352) Increases the dollar limitation on the election to expense certain depreciable business assets. (Sec. 6353) Includes as a principal place of business, for purposes of qualifying a home office for the deductibility of expenses, a place of business used by the taxpayer for administrative or management activities of a trade or business if there is no other fixed location where the taxpayer conducts such activities. (Sec. 6354) Treats the storage of product samples as inventory for deduction purposes. Subtitle D: Family Reinforcement - Allows an income tax credit for up to $5,000 of qualified adoption expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the taxable year. Sets forth a formula for reduction of such credit for taxpayers whose adjusted gross income exceeds $60,000. Denies such a credit for any expense for which a deduction or credit is allowable under another Code provision. Defines \"qualified adoption expenses\" as reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney's fees, and other lawful expenses directly related to legal adoption of a child, but not any expenses paid from any funds received under a Federal, State, or local program. Disqualifies for such a credit any expenses in connection with the adoption of a child of the taxpayer's spouse. (Sec. 6402) Allows a tax credit for an individual who maintains a household which includes one or more qualified persons requiring custodial care equal to $500 for each such person.
