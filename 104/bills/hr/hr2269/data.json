    "text": "Child Security Act of 1995 - Establishes a monthly child support assurance benefits program with payments made by the Secretary of Health and Human Services following prescribed guidelines. Excludes such payments from consideration as income for purposes of determining eligibility for: (1) housing benefits; or (2) food stamps. (Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary to establish a national registry of child support orders whose functions shall include maintenance of abstracts of child support orders accessible by the Secretary of the Treasury. Amends Part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) to require the States to have statutorily prescribed procedures to ensure that child support orders are immediately transmitted to such registry, including the social security account number of each parent with rights or obligations under the order. (Sec. 4) Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prescribe child support enforcement guidelines through wage withholding and income tax collection. Establishes the Office of the Child Advocate in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to assist in problem resolution relating to child support enforcement by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and to advise on administrative practices and potential legislative changes. (Sec. 5) Prescribes guidelines for: (1) HHS distribution of child support payments collected by the IRS; and (2) the assignment of rights to past-due support. (Sec. 7) Instructs the Secretary to: (1) establish the National Child Support Guideline Commission to develop recommendations for uniform national child support guidelines; and (2) transmit Commission recommendations to the Congress. (Sec. 8) Amends part D of SSA title IV to require State plans to provide for the uniform termination of child support obligations after specified ages. (Sec. 9) Mandates that HHS: (1) promulgate a methodology to determine State staffing needs relating to child support enforcement; and (2) develop a plan detailing the steps that the State must take to meet such requirements. Mandates that State Medicaid plans require the operation of a State program for: (1) child support enforcement; and (2) Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC). Increases from three percent to five percent the amount deducted from Federal assistance payments as a penalty for noncompliance. (Sec. 11) Instructs the Secretary to authorize five States to conduct five-year social services demonstration projects giving priority in job opportunities and basic skills (JOBS) training programs under part F of SSA title IV to parents unable to support their children financially."
