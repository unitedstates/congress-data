Title II: Sports Arena - Authorizes the designated authority (the Redevelopment Land Agency or such other District of Columbia government agency or instrumentality designated by the Mayor of the District) to borrow funds through obligations which are secured by revenues pledged to finance, refinance, or reimburse the costs of specified arena preconstruction activities if it is granted such authority by the District government. Provides that the borrowing of funds must be secured by such pledged revenues of the District which are attributable to the sports arena tax and which are transferred by the Mayor to the designated authority pursuant to the Omnibus Budget Support Act of 1994. Prohibits such debt from: (1) being considered a general obligation debt of the District; (2) constituting the lending of the public credit for private undertakings for purposes of the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act; and (3) being a pledge of, or involve the full faith and credit of, the District. Permits the District and the designated authority to pledge as security for any borrowing undertaken pursuant to this Act any District revenues which are attributable to the sports arena tax, upon the transfer of such revenues by the Mayor to such authority pursuant to the Omnibus Budget Support Act of 1994. Excludes such pledged revenues from the formula used to calculate the annual aggregate limit on the District's debt. Allows the following activities to be carried out without the enactment of appropriations by the Congress: (1) borrowing conducted pursuant to this Act; (2) pledging of revenues as security for such borrowing; (3) payment of principal, interest, premium, debt servicing, contributions to reserves, or other costs associated with such borrowing; and (4) other obligations or expenditures made to carry out any arena preconstruction activity described in this Act. Title III: Waiver of Congressional Review - Makes the Arena Tax Payment and Use Amendment Act of 1995 effective on this Act's enactment (thereby, waiving congressional review of such Act)."
