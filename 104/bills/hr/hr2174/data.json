Terminates the Commission 90 days after submission of such report. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the appropriate congressional committees should: (1) initiate hearings to consider the findings and recommendations of the report; and (2) consider whether to adopt a resolution stating the sense of the Congress on whether diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam should be maintained."
