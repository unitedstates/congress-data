Prohibits quotas. Declares that this Act does not apply to religious organizations (except in their for-profit activities). Provides for enforcement. Disallows State immunity. Makes the United States liable for all remedies (except punitive damages) to the same extent as a private person. Allows recovery of attorney's fees. Requires posting notices for employees and applicants. Sets forth factors that pertain to job performance, including ability and willingness to comply with performance requirements (including attendance and procedures), any use of a drug or of alcohol that may adversely affect job performance, any conviction of an offense for which a term of imprisonment exceeding one year could have been imposed, and the ability to work well with others."
