    "text": "Sports Relocation Reform Act of 1996 - Authorizes any U.S. professional sports league to establish a rule: (1) authorizing the league membership to decide whether or not a member team may be relocated; and (2) requiring that any person seeking to change the home territory of a member team obtain league approval. Makes the antitrust laws inapplicable to the enforcement or application of any such rules. Outlines procedural requirements for requests for approval of a proposed relocation, requiring each league to establish rules and procedures governing such requests. Outlines criteria to be considered during such process, including fan loyalty and the extent to which the requesting team has entered into good faith negotiations of terms and conditions required to continue to play in the current territory. Requires the league to conduct hearings in which interested parties are afforded an opportunity to submit written testimony and exhibits. Provides for judicial review through a civil action filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, with an exception for a team located in the District of Columbia area. Authorizes such Court to remand the matter for further consideration by the league and enjoin any relocation until the league has completed such reconsideration. Prohibits multiple lawsuits by other interested parties."
