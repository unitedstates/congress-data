(Sec. 1) Adds a hold harmless provision relating to Federal acquisition of real property, whereby no eligible local educational agency (LEA) shall receive less than 85 percent of the preceding year's amount in payment for any fiscal year. (Sec. 2) Makes two specified school districts in South Dakota eligible to apply for certain increased payments. (Sec. 3) Provides that children who would have resided in military installation housing on Federal property, if such property were not undergoing renovation on the date of eligibility determination, shall be considered eligible federally connected children for purposes of impact aid payments to LEAs. (Sec. 4) Sets forth requirements for the method of computation of impact aid payments with respect to eligible federally connected children in States with only one LEA. (Sec. 5) Revises certain provisions relating to data and determination of available funds of LEAs. (Sec. 6) Provides for priority payments relating to Federal property. Directs the Secretary of Education to first use certain excess amounts to make increased payments for any LEA that: (1) received a specified payment FY 1996; (2) serves a school district that contains all or a portion of a U.S. military academy; (3) serves a school district in which the local tax assessor has certified that at least 60 percent of the real property is federally owned; and (4) demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such agency's per-pupil revenue derived from local sources for current expenditures is not less than that revenue for the preceding fiscal year. (Sec. 7) Sets forth requirements relating to the Secretary's treatment of certain impact aid payments. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring repayment of such payments in certain cases. (Sec. 8) Sets forth a special rule relating to availability of funds for a certain LEA in New Jersey, under specified Federal law relating to impact aid. (Sec. 9) Directs the Secretary to compute certain impact aid payments to LEAs on the basis of a corrected local contribution rate, under specified conditions. (Sec. 10) Amends ESEA with respect to State equalization plans."
