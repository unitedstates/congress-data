(Sec. 105) Modifies provisions of the Act regarding: (1) concentration of Federal effort to repeal the requirement that each Federal agency administering a Federal juvenile delinquency program submit annually a juvenile delinquency development statement; and (2) an annual report to require that such report include an evaluation of programs funded and their effectiveness in reducing the incidence of juvenile crime, particularly violent crimes. (Sec. 106) Eliminates: (1) the Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention; and (2) certain allocations of funds to the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.

Requires State plans to: (1) contain plans for providing needed services for the prevention and treatment of juvenile delinquency in rural areas, mental health services to juveniles in the juvenile justice system, and gender-specific services for the prevention and treatment of juvenile delinquency; and (2) provide for the coordination and maximum utilization of existing juvenile delinquency programs, programs operated by private agencies, and other related programs in the State. Requires such plans to provide that not less than 75 percent of the funds available to the State be used for specified purposes, including: (1) programs that assist in holding juveniles accountable for their actions; (2) a system of graduated sanctions for juvenile delinquents that ensures a sanction for every delinquent act; (3) expanded use of probation officers; (4) boot camps for juvenile offenders; (5) other activities (such as court-appointed special advocates) that the State determines will hold juveniles accountable for their acts and decrease juvenile involvement in delinquent activities; (6) a system (subject to the discretion of the State) that provides for the prosecution as adults of juveniles under age 18 who commit an act that would be a violent crime if committed by an adult; (7) a system of records equivalent to the records that would be kept for adults relating to any adjudication of juveniles as delinquent for conduct that would constitute a violent crime if committed by an adult; and (8) programs that utilize multidisciplinary interagency case management and information sharing that enable the juvenile justice and law enforcement agencies, schools, and social service agencies to make more informed decisions regarding early identification, control, supervision, and treatment of juveniles who repeatedly commit violent or serious delinquent acts. Requires State plans to: (1) allow certain juveniles to be placed in secure detention or correctional facilities temporarily to the extent necessary to reunite such juveniles with their parents or legal guardians; (2) provide that juveniles alleged or found to be delinquent will not have unsupervised incidental contact with incarcerated adults convicted of a crime or awaiting trial on criminal charges; (3) provide that no juvenile will be detained or confined in any jail or lockup for adults, except, at the election of the State, juveniles who are convicted or charged as an adult with a violent crime and under other specified circumstances; and (4) provide that if a juvenile is taken into custody under a valid court order issued for committing a status offense, the appropriate child protective services agency shall be promptly notified, an authorized representative of such agency shall interview such juvenile in person within 24 hours, such representative shall submit a recommendation to the court that issued such order regarding the proper treatment plan for such juvenile, and such court shall conduct a hearing within 72 hours to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that such juvenile committed such status offense and to determine the appropriate placement of such juvenile pending disposition of the status offense that is the subject of such order.

(Sec. 117) Modifies Act provisions regarding: (1) considerations for approval of grant applications to direct the Administrator to consider the potential for success of the proposed program and the extent to which the program serves communities that have high rates of juvenile delinquency, violent juvenile crime, dropping out of school, unemployment among juveniles no longer attending elementary or secondary school, and juvenile participation in gangs; and (2) gang-free schools and communities to authorize the Administrator to make grants to, or contracts with, public and nonprofit private agencies and organizations to establish and carry out programs designed to prevent and reduce the participation of juveniles in gangs that commit crimes (particularly violent crimes), unlawfully use firearms and other weapons, or unlawfully traffic in drugs. Directs the Administrator to give priority to applications for grants and contracts to carry out programs that have the greatest potential for success, private sector support, and broad-based community support.
