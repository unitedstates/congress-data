Title II: Make Work Pay - Amends SSA titles XIX (Medicaid) and IV part A (AFDC), the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and other specified Federal law, to make various specified changes with regard to certain program aspects, including: (1) extended Medicaid enrollment for former AFDC recipients; (2) increased AFDC earned income disregards; (3) limited AFDC income and resource disregards of savings for education, first time home purchase, or microenterprise initiatives; (4) child care, including replacement of current Federal child care programs with State-administered block grant programs for child care services, as well as child care for work first program participants; and (5) refundable tax credits for dependent care and other expenses connected with gaining employment in order to enable AFDC recipients to become self-sufficient. (Sec. 213) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to require participating residents to receive advanced earned income payments from a responsible State agency pursuant to a State Advance Payment Program in lieu of receiving earned income advance amounts from an employer. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to designate up to four State Advance Payment Demonstrations. Title III: The Work First Program - Amends SSA title IV to replace the current Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training Program under part F with a new program for assessing the employability of AFDC recipients and providing for their participation in job search activities, as well as a new Work First Program that allows participating States to establish one of two types of work programs, with one type similar to the programs operated by Riverside County, California and the State of Oregon. (Sec. 301) Requires a State to develop an individual responsibility plan, involving job search and other employment-related activities, for each aid applicant or recipient 18 years of age or older who has not completed high school or obtained a certificate of high school equivalency, and is not attending secondary school.

Requires a work supplementation component under such programs that provides for subsidized private sector or State or local government jobs. Requires States to provide program participants with the necessary case management services to ensure integrated benefits and services provided under such programs. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) States should target individuals who have not attained 25 years of age for participation in work first programs; and (2) the Secretary and the States should consider the needs of rural areas in designing State plans under SSA title IV part G. (Sec. 305) Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to community- based organizations that move AFDC recipients into the private work sector. Authorizes appropriations. Title IV: Family Responsibility and Improved Child Support Enforcement - Amends part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of SSA title IV to require States to have statutorily prescribed procedures to: (1) record child support orders in a central case registry; and (2) collect child support payments through a centralized collections unit.

(Sec. 403) Requires State plans to establish procedural guidelines for: (1) notification of all proceedings and orders affecting child support obligations; and (2) privacy safeguards regarding paternity and child support actions. (Sec. 411) Revises the formula for: (1) Federal matching payments to the States; and (2) incentive adjustments to the Federal matching rate. (Sec. 413) Requires a State plan for child and spousal support to include prescribed procedures for State reviews and audits.

(Sec. 416) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to conduct staffing studies of each State child support enforcement program and to report the results to the Congress. (Sec. 417) Makes funds available to the Secretary for: (1) training of Federal and State staff, research and demonstration programs, and special projects of regional and national significance; and (2) operation of the Federal Parent Locator Service. (Sec. 421) Mandates that the single statewide automated data system function as a single central case registry of State-provided services and support orders. Delineates contents of case records and data matching activities, including data exchange with sister States. (Sec. 422) Requires State plans to include a centralized, automated unit for the collection and disbursement of support payments. (Sec. 423) Requires the States to have statutorily prescribed procedures: (1) for mandatory income withholding for support payments subject to enforcement; and (2) under which child support orders issued before October 1, 1996, shall become subject to withholding from wages if arrearages occur, without the need for a judicial or administrative hearing. Revises the procedural guidelines for income withholding for child support enforcement. (Sec. 425) Revises the Federal Parent Locator Service to add kinds of information which may be transmitted to locate individuals and assets for purposes of establishing parentage and executing child support obligations.
