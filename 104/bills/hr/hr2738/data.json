    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Central Valley Project Reform Title II: Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Title I: Central Valley Project Reform - Central Valley Project Reform Act of 1995 - Amends the Central Valley Project Improvement Act to redefine: (1) \"anadromous fish\" to exclude striped bass, sturgeon, and American shad; (2) \"Central Valley Project water\" to mean water developed, diverted, stored, or delivered by the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with statutes authorizing the Central Valley Project (CVP) and with the terms and conditions of water rights permits or licenses acquired by or issued to the United States pursuant to California law; and (3) \"repayment contract\" and \"water service contract\" to exclude contracts which contain terms or agreements for water rights settlements or exchanges. Excludes from the definition of CVP water \"base supply\" water as defined in certain contracts between the United States and diverters of water from the Sacramento River. (Sec. 104) Prohibits the Secretary from entering into any new short-term, temporary, or long-term contracts or agreements for water supply from the CVP for other than fish or wildlife purposes before the Secretary has completed appropriate environmental review and determined that there is sufficient water to meet existing contractual and legal obligations. Directs the Secretary, upon request, to renew any existing long-term repayment or water service contracts which provide for the delivery of water from the CVP for a period of 25 years and to renew such contracts for successive 25-year periods. Validates and ratifies all contracts renewed by the Secretary between January 1, 1988, and October 31, 1992, with an exception. (Sec. 105) Revises provisions regarding: (1) water transfers, their approval or disapproval, and the appeal of such determination; (2) water conservation standards; (3) fish, wildlife, and habitat restoration; and (4) the CVP Restoration Fund. (Sec. 108) Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts with any (currently, only nonprofit) organizations for the additional storage and delivery of CVP water. Directs the Secretary, on a priority basis and within two years, to develop and submit to the Congress a least-cost plan to increase CVP yield by the amount reserved and managed for fish and wildlife purposes and otherwise required to meet CVP purposes. Authorizes and directs the Secretary to coordinate with California in implementing measures for the long-term solutions to problems in the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary. Directs the Secretary to identify the water supply impacts resulting from the reallocation of Stanislaus River water for fish and wildlife purposes and to develop and implement a plan to provide long-term replacement water in an amount equal to the identified impacts on out-of-basin entities which have contracted with the Secretary for water from the New Melones Project. (Sec. 109) Prohibits the reduction by more than a specified amount of the first preference entitlement to CVP electrical power provided to Calaveras and Tuolumne Counties, California. Title II: Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities - Reclamation Recycling and Water Conservation Act of 1995 - Amends the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 to authorize the Secretary to participate in the design, planning, and construction of the following water reclamation and reuse projects: the North San Diego County Area Water Recycling Project, the Calleguas Municipal Water District Recycling Project, the Central Valley Water Recycling Project, the St. George Area Water Recycling Project, the Watsonville Area Water Recycling Project, the Southern Nevada Water Recycling Project, the Albuquerque Metropolitan Area Water Reclamation and Reuse Study, the El Paso Water Reclamation and Reuse Project, the Pasadena, California reclaimed water project, Phase 1 of the Orange County Regional Water Reclamation Project, the West Jordan Water Reuse Project, the Hi-Desert Water District in Yucca Valley, California wastewater collection and treatment project, the Oceanside, California Groundwater Desalting Demonstration Project, the Water Replenishment District of Southern California, and the San Joaquin Area Water Recycling and Reuse Project. Limits to 25 percent the Federal share of the total design, planning, and construction costs. (Sec. 203) Authorizes the Secretary to participate in the design, planning, and construction of the Long Beach Desalination Research and Development Project in Los Angeles County, California. Limits to 50 percent the Federal share of such costs. Prohibits the Secretary from providing operation and maintenance funds for such project."
