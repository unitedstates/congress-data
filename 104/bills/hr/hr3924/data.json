    "text": "Statistical Confidentiality Act - Designates Federal Statistical Data Centers. Authorizes the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), after consultation with the head of an agency proposing a reorganization that eliminates, or substantially alters the missions or functions of, an agency or unit designated as a Statistical Data Center, to designate an agency or unit to serve as a successor statistical data center under the terms of this Act if certain criteria are met. Requires, among other things, that statistical data centers: (1) identify opportunities to eliminate duplication and otherwise reduce the reporting burden and cost imposed on the public by sharing information for exclusively statistical purposes; and (2) safeguard the confidentiality of identifiable information acquired for statistical purposes. Directs that data or information acquired by a statistical data center for exclusively statistical purposes: (1) be used only for statistical purposes; and (2) not be disclosed in identifiable form for any other purpose without the informed consent of the respondent. Permits the disclosure of data or information by an agency to one or more statistical data centers. States that the disclosure be made under the terms of a written agreement. Provides for coordination and oversight of confidentiality and disclosure policies by the Director. Requires: (1) the head of each statistical data center to report to OMB each disclosure agreement and the results of any review of information security undertaken at the request of OMB or any similar review undertaken on the initiative of the statistical data center or an agency supplying data or information to such a center; and (2) OMB to include a summary of all such reports and any actions taken by OMB in its annual report to the Congress on statistical programs."
