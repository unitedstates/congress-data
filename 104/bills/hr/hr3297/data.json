    "text": "Modifies certain restrictions on the use of motorboats on, and motorized portages between, specified lakes within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in Minnesota. Permits the operation of motorized vehicles and associated equipment which is necessary to assist in the transport of boats across the portages from Moose Lake Chain (currently, Sucker Lake) to Basswood Lake, from Fall Lake to Basswood Lake, and from Lake Vermilion to Trout Lake. Establishes the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Intergovernmental Council to: (1) prepare and submit to the Secretary of Agriculture draft amendments and regularly scheduled revisions to the Wilderness management plan; (2) provide comments on the environmental impact of major Federal actions; and (3) analyze the economic and environmental costs and benefits of implementing sustainable practices for the Wilderness. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary: (1) to receive the Council's draft amendments, recommend revisions, and adopt the revised amendments that are consistent with the public interest and applicable laws; (2) if the Secretary decides not to adopt the Council's revised amendments, to appoint, and revise the management plan based on amendments submitted by, a management plan board; or (3) if the Council declines to submit revised amendments, to make necessary and appropriate amendments and implement the plan. Directs the Secretary to seek the Council's comments when considering major Federal actions that require public involvement and notification under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969."
