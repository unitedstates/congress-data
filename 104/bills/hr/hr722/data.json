Specifies a $2 billion per fiscal year maximum and 20-year term for such guarantees. Sets forth provisions limiting such guarantees and their costs to the extent such amounts are provided in advance in appropriation Acts. Provides that a prohibition under the Act against Fund issuance of stocks, bonds, debentures, notes or other securities shall not apply to its issuance of guaranteed debt instruments. Prohibits the use of proceeds from the issuance of such securities to provide financial assistance, including equity investment, to any community development financial institution with assets of more than $50 million."
