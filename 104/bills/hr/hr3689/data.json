Allows waiver of such requirement if during the previous year such a country has taken substantial steps, but has been unable, to fully cooperate with the United States, or has taken substantial, but inadequate, steps on its own, to achieve full compliance with the objectives established by the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Requires the Secretary of State, in addition to other reporting requirements, to report annually to specified congressional committees on the list of objectives that such countries and the United States agree on for purposes of certification."
