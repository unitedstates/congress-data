Prohibits: (1) the abusive party, at any time after the child attains age 13, from having custody over, or visitation rights with, such child without the child's consent; or (2) the Court, if any person had actual or legal custody over, or offered safe refuge to, the child while the case or other related actions were pending, from depriving such person of custody or visitation rights over the child or otherwise imposing sanctions on the person on the grounds that he or she had such custody or offered such refuge."
