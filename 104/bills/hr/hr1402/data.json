Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to report annually to the Congress on amounts transferred into the Fund. Requires the information to be printed in the Congressional Record. Permits conscientious objectors to designate on their income tax returns that any tax liability be paid into the Fund. Makes this designation procedure available to any individual who has demonstrated himself or herself, by reason of religious training and belief, to be opposed to participation in war in any form. Requires every taxpayer who makes such a designation for any taxable year to file a questionnaire return for the purpose of determining eligibility for such status. Permits the setting aside of criminal or civil penalties imposed upon a taxpayer for nonpayment of tax prior to enactment of this Act if the taxpayer pays the tax due (with interest) and establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury that the nonpayment was due to religious beliefs. Authorizes corresponding procedures in connection with estate and gift tax payments, under conditions prescribed by the Secretary. Directs the Comptroller General to determine the percentage of actual appropriations made by the United States from the Federal budget during the preceding year for military purposes. Requires publication of this information in the Congressional Record. Authorizes a portion of the Fund (corresponding to amounts expended for military purposes) to be appropriated each fiscal year for the following programs and activities: (1) the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC); (2) Head Start; (3) the United States Institute of Peace; and (4) the Peace Corps."
