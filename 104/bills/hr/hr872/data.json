Title II: Missile Defense - Directs the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) to: (1) develop for deployment at the earliest possible date a cost- and operationally-effective antiballistic missile system to protect the United States against ballistic missile attacks; and (2) develop for expeditious deployment advanced theater missile defense systems. Requires a plan with respect to the deployment of such systems to be submitted to specified congressional committees within 60 days after enactment of this Act. Title III: Advisory Commission on Revitalization of National Security - Establishes the Revitalization of National Security Commission to conduct a comprehensive review of the long-term U.S. national security needs. Requires an interim and final report from the Commission to designated congressional committees on its assessments and recommendations. Prohibits the Secretary of the Army, during the period between the enactment of this Act and the submission of the interim report, from implementing the plan to reorganize the Army Reserve's continental U.S. headquarters that was announced by the Secretary on January 4, 1995. Provides funding. Title IV: Command of United States Forces - Prohibits funds made available to the Department of Defense (DOD) from being obligated or expended for activities of any element of the armed forces that is placed under UN command or control after the date of enactment of this Act. Waives such prohibition if the President, at least 15 days in advance, certifies to the Congress that such command or control is necessary to protect U.S. national security interests. Allows the President, in emergency situations, to allow such UN command or control without the advance notification, but requires congressional notification within 48 hours after such action. Outlines certification requirements. Requires the President to submit to the Congress a memorandum of legal points and authorities explaining why the foreign placement of U.S. military personnel does not violate the Constitution. Excepts ongoing operations in Macedonia and Croatia from the above requirements. (Sec. 402) Amends the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 (the Act) to require approval by the Congress, by law, of any presidential action taken which makes available to the UN Security Council U.S. armed forces for international peace and security activities. Provides exceptions: (l) in the case of presidential certifications, as above; and (2) when such action is authorized by law. Outlines certification requirements and provides an exception for ongoing operations in Macedonia and Croatia. Requires the President to submit to the Congress the same legal memorandum as required above. Title V: United Nations - Amends the Act to specifically limit the U.S. assessment for UN expenditures in support of international peacekeeping operations. Requires crediting for the United States by the UN for the costs of U.S. support for, or participation in, such activities. Directs the President to submit annually to designated congressional committees a report on the total amount of any fiscal year's incremental costs incurred by DOD to support such activities. (Sec. 502) Codifies within the Act specified provisions of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995, concerning the required notification to the Congress of proposed UN peacekeeping activities (excluding intelligence activities reportable under title V of the National Security Act of 1947). Requires within such notification a description of any uncovered U.S. assistance to or support for such activities. Defines a new UN peacekeeping operation as one to be expanded by more than 25 percent during the period covered, or one to be authorized to operate in a country in which it was not previously authorized. (Sec. 503) Requires presidential notification to designated congressional committees within 15 days: (1) after receipt by the United States of a billing request from the UN for the U.S. contribution toward UN peacekeeping activities; or (2) before the U.S. obligates funds for such contributions (except for emergencies, in which case notification is required within 48 hours of such obligation). (Sec. 504) Requires the President to notify designated congressional committees at least 15 days before any agency or entity of the U.S. Government makes available to the UN any assistance or facility to support or facilitate UN peacekeeping activities, with exceptions. Provides the same emergency exception as above. (Sec. 505) Requires, in a report required under the Act, a description of the anticipated budget for the next fiscal year for U.S. participation in UN peacekeeping activities. (Sec. 506) Authorizes the Secretary, in emergency circumstances, to waive the requirement for reimbursement to the United States for in-kind contributions to UN peacekeeping activities. Requires appropriate notification to the designated congressional committees. Directs the Secretary of State to ensure that U.S. goods provided by DOD on a reimbursable basis for UN peacekeeping activities are reimbursed at the appropriate value. Directs the U.S. Permanent Representative to the UN to report to the designated congressional committees on all U.S. action taken to achieve such objectives. (Sec. 507) Prohibits appropriated funds from being used in any fiscal year to pay any U.S. assessed or voluntary contribution for UN peacekeeping activities until the Secretary certifies to the designated congressional committees that the UN has reimbursed DOD directly for all goods and services provided during the previous fiscal year for such activities. Directs the President to establish procedures for the submission to the UN of requests for reimbursement for such goods and services provided on a reimbursable basis. (Sec. 508) States that, beginning October 1, 1995, funds made available to DOD shall be available for UN peacekeeping activities, any U.S. arrearage to the UN, or their related incremental costs only to the extent that the Congress has by law specifically made those funds available for such purpose. (Sec. 509) Codifies within the Act a specified provision which limits the use of funds authorized for Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities for payment of the U.S. assessed contribution for a UN peacekeeping operation to 25 percent of the total amount of all assessed contributions for such operation. Refuses to recognize any arrearages that accumulate as a result of assessments in excess of such percentage. (Sec. 510) Prohibits funds from being obligated or expended for U.S. contributions to UN peacekeeping activities unless the Secretary of State determines and certifies to the designated congressional committees that U.S. manufacturers and suppliers are being given opportunities equal to foreign manufacturers and suppliers to provide equipment, material, and services for such activities. (Sec. 511) Withholds specified percentages of U.S. assessed and voluntary contributions toward UN peacekeeping activities until receipt by the Congress of a certification by the President that the UN, through its Office of Inspector General, has undertaken certain prescribed activities with respect to a financial and management accounting of UN peacekeeping activities. (Sec. 512) Requires the President, before intelligence is provided to the UN by the United States, to ensure that the CIA Director has established guidelines governing the provision of intelligence to the UN which protects intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with provisions of the National Security Act of 1947. Requires periodic reports from the President on the types and purposes of intelligence provided to the UN, and special reports concerning any unauthorized disclosure of intelligence. Directs the Secretary of State to work with the UN to improve the handling, processing, dissemination, and management of all intelligence provided to it by its members. Title VI: Revitalization and Expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - NATO Expansion Act of 1995 - Declares that it should be U.S. policy: (1) to continue the commitment to an active leadership role in NATO; (2) to join with NATO allies to redefine the role of the alliance in the post-Cold War world, taking into account specified factors; (3) to affirm that NATO military planning should include joint military operations beyond the geographic bounds of the alliance under the North Atlantic Treaty when the shared interests of the United States and other member countries require such actions to defend vital interests; (4) to expeditiously pursue joint cooperation agreements for the acquisition of essential systems to significantly increase NATO crisis management capabilities; (5) that Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia should be permitted to join NATO in the near future as long as each such country meets specified standards and undertakes certain commitments; (6) that the United States and other NATO member nations should furnish appropriate assistance to enable such countries to achieve membership; (7) that certain policy decisions of the North Atlantic Council should be reaffirmed with respect to admitting new NATO members only by amendment to the North Atlantic Treaty; (8) that the expansion of NATO should be defensive in nature and increase stability for all European nations; (9) that NATO and its members should cooperate closely with Russia on security issues and strengthen other structures of security cooperation in Europe; and (10) that other European countries may be in a position to achieve NATO membership at a future date. (Sec. 604) Directs the President to establish a program to assist the transition to full NATO membership of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and any other European country emerging from communist domination that is designated by the President. Outlines types of assistance to be provided. Prohibits the President from providing assistance to any country selling or transferring defense articles to a state that has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism as determined by the Secretary of State. Requires: (1) a report from the President to designated congressional committees prior to providing assistance to a country for the first time under the program; and (2) annual reports from the President to the appropriate congressional committees on the progress made in implementing this section. Title VII: Budget Firewalls - Expresses the sense of the Congress that so-called \"budget firewalls\" between defense and domestic discretionary spending should be established for each of FY 1996 through 1998."
