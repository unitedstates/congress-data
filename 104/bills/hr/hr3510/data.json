Amends the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 to extend the payment of any portion of Tier II Railroad Retirement benefits to surviving former spouses pursuant to divorce agreements. Amends Federal law to provide for a survivor annuity to widows, widowers, and certain former spouses of Federal employees who die after having separated from the service with title to a deferred annuity, but before attaining age for such annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System on the same basis as is currently provided to certain survivors of former Members of Congress. Revises provisions concerning Federal retirement benefits subject to a court order."
