    "text": "Crimes Against the Elderly Penalty Act - Amends the Federal criminal code to impose mandatory minimum sentences for committing violent felonies against individuals aged 65 or over. Prohibits suspended, probationary, and concurrent sentences. Prohibits any plea bargaining agreements that would result in the defendant's serving less than the minimum sentence. Provides that an appeal by the United States shall lie to a court of appeals from an otherwise final decision, judgment, or order of a district court sentencing a defendant on the ground that such sentence is less severe than that required under such provisions. Amends rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to: (1) provide that neither the defendant nor the court may waive a presentence investigation and report unless there is in the record information sufficient for the court to determine whether a mandatory sentence must be imposed pursuant to such provisions; and (2) require that the presentence report include information relating to whether any victim had attained age 65 on the date that the offense was committed."
