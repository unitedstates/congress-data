    "text": "Computer Gambling Prevention Act of 1996 - Modifies Federal criminal code provisions regarding the transmission of wagering information (wagering provisions) to set penalties for anyone engaged in betting or wagering who knowingly uses a wire or electronic communication facility for the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of bets, wagers, or information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers or for the transmission of such a communication which entitles the recipient to receive money or credit as a result of bets. Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to: (1) review the deterrent effect of existing guidelines applicable to the wagering provisions and report to the Congress; and (2) amend or promulgate guidelines to ensure that individuals convicted under such provisions are imprisoned for not less than one year. Requires the Attorney General to submit a report to the Congress that includes: (1) an analysis of the problems associated with enforcing the wagering provisions; (2) recommendations for the best use of the resources of the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission to enforce such provisions; and (3) an estimate of the amount of activity and money being used to gamble on the Internet."
