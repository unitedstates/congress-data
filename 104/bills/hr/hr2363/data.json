(Sec. 104) Prescribes procedural guidelines with respect to the refund of amounts in a deposit insurance fund in excess of the designated reserve amount.

Prohibits the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision from granting any charter for a Federal savings association. Amends the FDIA to treat State Savings Associations as banks for purposes of Federal banking law. (Sec. 202) Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to permit continuation of grandfathered bank holding company activities and affiliations.
