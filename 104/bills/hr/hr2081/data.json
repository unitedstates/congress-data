Directs the Secretary to notify the holder (or other party giving notice) of the recognition or objections of the Secretary to the right-of-way or any portion thereof within two years or the right-of-way shall be deemed to be valid. Allows the Secretary to bring an action to challenge the validity of the right-of-way in a U.S. district court within two years after notifying a holder of objections or the right-of-way shall be deemed to be valid. Permits a holder to bring an action to quiet title with respect to such a right-of-way within the later of: (1) 12 years from the date of notice of objection from the Secretary; or (2) the termination of the limitations period applicable under the Federal judicial code. Prohibits the Secretary from closing any right-of-way in use before October 21, 1976: (1) until one year after providing notice to the appropriate State or subdivision; or (2) if closure would leave any adjoining non-Federal lands without an established public or private access."
