    "text": "Saving Police Officers' Lives Act of 1995 - Amends Federal criminal code firearms provisions to expand the definition of \"armor piercing ammunition\" to include a projectile that may be used in a handgun that the Secretary of the Treasury determines to be capable of penetrating body armor. Directs the Secretary to make such determination in accordance with regulations that provide for the uniform testing of projectiles against the Body Armor Exemplar based on standards developed in consultation with representatives of selected Federal, State, county, and local law enforcement agencies. Authorizes the Secretary to promulgate regulations to carry out the intent of this Act upon finding that any ammunition, the manufacture or importation of which would be prohibited under such regulation, serves no substantial sporting purpose and serves primarily to kill human beings, subject to specified consultation requirements. Prohibits such a regulation from taking effect until ten days after it is published in the Federal Register and delivered to the Congress."
