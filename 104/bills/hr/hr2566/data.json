Sets forth expenditure limits of $600,000 by a candidate and authorized committees, allowing additional expenditures for runoffs and contested primaries. Provides for complying candidates running against noncomplying candidates. Entitles eligible candidates to receive certain broadcast media rates and reduced postage rates. Provides for Federal Election Commission certification of whether a candidate is eligible. Mandates repayment of benefits not used as required and civil penalties for excessive expenditures. (Sec. 102) Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to: (1) modify broadcast media candidate rate requirements; and (2) regulate rates for eligible House candidates. Regulates preemption. Changes the circumstances in which a station license may be revoked for failure to allow candidate access. Conditions new licenses and renewal on agreement to abide by these provisions. (Sec. 103) Amends Federal law to require postal rates for third class mail sent by eligible House candidates to be the same as for qualified nonprofit organizations. (Sec. 104) Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to set contribution limits for eligible House candidates. (Sec. 105) Sets forth expenditure reporting requirements. Title II: Reduction of Special Interest Influence - Subtitle A: Elimination of Political Action Committees From Federal Election Activities - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit, notwithstanding any other provision of the Act, any person other than an individual or a political committee from making contributions, soliciting or receiving contributions, or making expenditures to influence a Federal office election. Defines \"political committee\" to mean: (1) a candidate's principal campaign committee; (2) any national, State, or district political party committee; (3) certain local political party committees; and (4) combinations of a candidate's and a party's committees. Removes provisions that currently include in the definition of \"contribution or expenditure\" the establishment, administration, and solicitation of contributions to a separate political fund by a corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock. Modifies the circumstances in which a political committee that has supported more than one candidate may be designated as an authorized committee. Restricts the political committees that may be financed or controlled by any Federal office holder or candidate. Repeals provisions limiting multicandidate political committee contributions to candidates and their authorized political committees. (Sec. 202) Limits the aggregate amount of large contributions to congressional campaigns. (Sec. 203) Limits to $100 the aggregate contributions by a lobbyist with respect to any Federal office election. Subtitle B: Provisions Relating to Soft Money of Political Parties - Prohibits political party national committees and any entity established, financed, or controlled by them from soliciting or receiving contributions or spending funds not subject to this Act. Requires amounts spent by a political party committee that might affect a Federal election (including voter registration, get-out-the- vote activity, generic campaign activity, and communications that identify a Federal candidate) to be made from funds subject to this Act. Prohibits political party committees from soliciting funds for or making donations to any organization that is tax exempt under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. Prohibits any Federal office holder or candidate and their agents from soliciting or receiving funds: (1) in connection with a Federal election unless the funds are subject to this Act; or (2) to be spent in connection with a non-Federal election unless the funds are not in excess of amounts permitted to Federal candidates and committees under provisions of this Act and are not from sources prohibited by this Act for Federal elections. Prohibits Federal office holders or candidates from having certain relationships with or taking certain actions regarding any organization described in section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. (Sec. 212) Imposes or modifies political committee reporting requirements. (Sec. 213) Removes the exclusion of office facility construction or purchase contributions from the definition of \"contribution.\" Subtitle C: Soft Money of Persons Other Than Political Parties - Imposes reporting requirements on disbursements over $2,000 by a person other than a political party committee or a candidate. Subtitle D: Contributions - Revises requirements regarding contributions made through an intermediary or conduit.
