Prohibits HIT retaliation for actions under this Act. Title II: Restrictions on Use and Disclosure - Prohibits disclosures except: (1) as allowed under this title; (2) as compatible with the purposes for which the information was obtained or for the specific purpose for which an individual authorized disclosure; and (3) in the minimum amount necessary to accomplish the disclosure's purpose.
