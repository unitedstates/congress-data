Defines an eligible individual as one who is: (1) not covered by an employer-provided group health plan; or (2) covered by such a plan which is a qualified catastrophic coverage health plan and is not covered by any other health plan. Allows penalty-free withdrawals from such accounts to the extent that amounts in such accounts exceed $15,000. Allows such deduction in arriving at adjusted gross income. Excludes employer contributions to such accounts from employment taxes. Establishes an excise tax for excess contributions to medical care savings accounts and makes such accounts subject to the tax on prohibited transactions. Allows the transfer of unused amounts in flexible spending accounts of cafeteria plans to medical savings accounts. Allows the full deduction for medical and dental expenses for amounts paid for qualified catastrophic coverage health plans. Title II: Development and Distribution of Comparative Value Information - Requires each State to develop and implement information programs regarding comparative health values for purchasers of health care. Makes grants available for the development of such programs. Requires Federal implementation of a program for any State that does not develop or continue to implement such a program. Requires the dissemination of comparative value information relative to Federal programs of health insurance and health care services. Requires the development of model systems to facilitate the gathering and analyzing of data on health care cost, quality, and outcome with respect to health insurance plans and hospitals. Authorizes appropriations."
