    "text": "Arizona Land Preservation and Management Act of 1996 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior: (1) by eminent domain, with the consent of the State of Arizona, to acquire certain State trust lands and to manage such lands in accordance with this Act; and (2) as compensation for State trust lands acquired under this Act, to transfer to the State specified Federal lands of equal value as may be agreed to by the State. Specifies that the total value of Federal lands transferred to the State by the Secretary in acquiring State lands under this Act may not exceed the fair market value of the lands acquired. Sets forth provisions regarding land appraisals and management of lands acquired by the Bureau of Land Management. Provides for the addition of specified acquired lands to the National Park System, the National Wildlife Refuge System, the National Forest System, and the Arizona National Memorial Cemetery. Authorizes the continuation for existing uses of acquired lands until such time as the use is determined to be incompatible with the purposes for which the lands are required to be used under this Act. Revokes the orders of the Secretary withdrawing lands for the Colorado River Storage Project and for Power Site Classification 272 on specified National Park Service-administered lands in Arizona. Directs the Secretary, in transferring to the State lands that front on the Lower Colorado River, Lake Havasu, or both, to include terms and conditions as necessary to protect the needs of the Bureau of Reclamation to have access to those lands for flowage easements and bank line protection."
