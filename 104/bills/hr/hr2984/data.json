Allows an individual to elect an alternative incremental credit. Makes the election of such credit applicable to the taxable year in which the election is made and for all succeeding taxable years, unless it is revoked with the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury. Increases from 65 percent to 80 percent the amount for contract research expenses with respect to amounts paid or incurred by the taxpayer to qualified research consortia for qualified research."
