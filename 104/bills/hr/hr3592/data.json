Directs the Secretary to ensure that dredged material disposal facilities do not result in unfair competition with potential private sector providers of such facilities. (Sec. 202) Increases from 25 to 35 percent the non-Federal share for nonstructural and other flood control projects. Sets forth criteria and procedures relating to the ability of a non-Federal interest to pay for flood control or agricultural water supply.

(Sec. 206) Authorizes the Secretary: (1) to carry out specified aquatic ecosystem restoration and protection projects; (2) in developing and carrying out a project for navigation involving the disposal of dredged material, to select a disposal method that is not the least-cost option under specified circumstances where the incremental costs are minimal and the benefits to the aquatic environment justify its selection; and (3) to undertake surveys, plans, and studies to encourage innovative and environmentally sound engineering solutions to problems of national significance. (Sec. 211) Sets forth provisions regarding construction of flood control projects by non-Federal interests, including reimbursement and credit of the non-Federal interest under specified circumstances. (Sec. 215) National Dam Safety Program Act of 1996 - Requires the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency: (1) in consultation with appropriation Federal agencies, State dam safety agencies, and a National Dam Safety Review Board (established by this section) to establish and maintain a coordinated national dam safety program; (2) to develop a dam safety improvements implementation plan; (3) at the request of a State, to provide training for State dam safety staff and inspectors; and (4) to engage in specified research activities. Authorizes the Secretary to maintain and periodically publish information on the inventory of dams. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 217) Directs the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with non-Federal sponsors of navigation projects for development of long-term management strategies for controlling sediments.
