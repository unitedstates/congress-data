Provides for periodic three-month adjustments in such rate. (Sec. 3) Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to determine the extent of the harm to the domestic winter tomato industry as a result of the devaluation in the Mexican peso in December 1994 and immediately take steps to remedy such harm. (Sec. 4) States that for purposes of applying standards provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, imports of tomatoes from Mexico shall be prohibited that do not meet specific requirements with respect to grade, size, and containers."
