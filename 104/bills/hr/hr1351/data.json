Increases the length of each navigation season by 15 days until the navigation season has increased by one month. Prohibits the Secretary from taking any action which would: (1) result in a reduction of a total of ten days or more a year in the number of days during which vessels are able to navigate channels; or (2) increase flood damages to land adjacent to navigation channels."
