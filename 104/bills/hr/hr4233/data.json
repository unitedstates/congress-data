    "text": "Savings in Construction Act of 1996 - Amends the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 to define specified terms, including: (1) full and open competition; (2) total installed price; (3) hard-metric; (4) cost or pricing data or price analysis; and (5) Federal facility. Requires the implementation of such Act in the acquisition of construction services and materials for Federal facilities. Directs that if the requirements of this Act conflict with specified Federal procurement provisions, then such provisions shall take precedence. Sets forth exceptions with respect to the implementation of such Act concerning concrete masonry units and recessed lighting fixtures. Requires the agency head to determine in writing according to specified criteria that specifications can only be satisfied by hard-metric versions. Requires the head of each agency that awards construction contracts within the United States and its territories to designate a senior agency official as a construction metrication ombudsman to, among other things, be: (1) responsible for reviewing and responding to complaints from prospective bidders, subcontractors, suppliers, or their designated representatives concerning use of the metric system of measurement in contracts for the construction of Federal buildings; (2) independent of the contracting officer for construction contracts; and (3) responsible for ensuring that the agency is not implementing the metric system of measurement in a manner that is either impractical, likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to U.S. firms, or inconsistent with specified guidelines while ensuring that the goals of the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 are observed."
