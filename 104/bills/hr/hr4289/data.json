Directs the President to consult with the appropriate congressional committees and determine whether each foreign country that is not a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is not according adequate trade benefits or substantially equal competitive opportunities to U.S. commerce. Mandates an increase in the rate of duty with respect to the products of such a country. Authorizes the President to increase such rate on any product of a non-market economy country that is not a WTO member if it: (1) denies its citizens the right or opportunity to emigrate; (2) imposes more than a nominal tax on emigration documents, for any purpose; or (3) imposes more than a nominal tax, fine, fee or other charge on any citizen as a consequence of such citizen's desire to emigrate to a country of his or her choice."
