    "text": "Health Centers Consolidation Act of 1995 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to replace the definition of \"community health center\" with provisions defining \"health center\" to mean an entity that provides to a medically underserved population primary health services and, as appropriate, additional health services. Lists required primary and permissible additional services. Authorizes grants to plan, develop, and operate health centers that will serve medically underserved populations, and grants regarding infant mortality and childhood morbidity, for: (1) migratory and seasonal agricultural workers and their families; (2) homeless individuals, including children at risk of homelessness, requiring grant recipients, in addition to providing primary health services, to provide substance abuse services; and (3) residents of public housing. Relocates (in each case to provisions relating to health centers (currently, community health centers)) provisions relating to: (1) environmental health hazards to migratory and seasonal agricultural workers; (2) definitions relating to such workers; (3) definitions relating to homeless individuals and to substance abuse; and (4) consultation with residents of public housing by grant recipients. Declares that provisions requiring health centers to serve all residents in a catchment area do not apply to grants authorized by this Act. Revises requirements regarding the handling of certain grant overpayments. Requires community centers to have an overall plan and budget meeting requirements of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (currently, requirements of specified provisions of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act). Removes requirements that: (1) the Secretary provide each grant recipient a list of resources to improve the environmental and nutritional status of individuals in the recipient's catchment area; and (2) each grant recipient have an annual financial audit. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the Secretary to reserve a specified percentage of amounts appropriated for supplemental awards to grantees demonstrating high or improved performance. Regulates the percentages of amounts awarded to various grants. Repeals from the Public Health Service Act provisions not relocated by this Act relating to migrant health centers, health services for the homeless, and health services for residents of public housing."
