    "text": "Middle East Peace Compliance Act of 1995 - Declares that the Congress has determined that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) continues to disregard the commitments it has made under specified agreements with Israel. Prohibits U.S. assistance to Palestinians living under the administrative control of the PLO or the Palestinian Authority until the President certifies to the Congress that: (1) the PLO and the Palestinian Authority have complied with the requirements of such agreements; (2) a financial audit has been made by the General Accounting Office (GAO) which provides a full accounting of all U.S. assistance to the Palestinian Authority; (3) the GAO has accounted for all U.S. and international assistance that it believes may have been misused by such entities; (4) the PLO has taken steps to provide information leading to the arrest and extradition to the United States for prosecution of PLO-connected individuals alleged to be responsible for terrorist attacks on specified American citizens or property since 1964; (5) full and fair compensation is provided by the PLO to U.S. victims of PLO terrorism; and (6) equipment and technology for security examination of cargo and vehicles have been made available to Israel. Directs the President to disclose in a classified manner to certain congressional committees the substance of any secret agreements, understandings, or promises, either formal or informal, between the United States and Israel, and the United States and the PLO, connected with the implementation of the Declaration of Principles, that commits the United States to certain courses of action or provisions of assistance. Authorizes the President to suspend specified provisions of Federal law until May 31, 1996, subject to prior approval of the Chairmen of certain congressional committees. Directs the President to request both the PLO and the Palestinian Authority to provide a financial statement of their assets and income for the year before enactment of this Act. Prohibits funds to the Palestinian Authority until the President reports such information to the relevant congressional committees. Prohibits the President from making any commitments or providing funds for any activity for the establishment of a U.S. diplomatic post in any area under the administrative control of the PLO or the Palestinian Authority."
