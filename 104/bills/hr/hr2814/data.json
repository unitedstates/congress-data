    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Construction Authorization Title II: Strategic Planning for Health Care Resources Title I: Construction Authorization - Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out specified major medical facility projects, in specified amounts, in Florida, California, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, North Carolina, Texas, and Arizona. Provides an obligation limitation with respect to two outpatient clinic projects. (Sec. 102) Authorizes the Secretary to enter into leases for two medical facilities in Florida and New York, in specified amounts. (Sec. 103) Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary for FY 1996 for two Construction, Major Projects, accounts and for the Medical Care account, in specified amounts, with a limitation. (Sec. 104) Directs the Secretary to report to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees (veterans' committees) on the health care needs of veterans in east central Florida. Prohibits the obligation of funds for the conversion of the former Orlando Naval Training Center Hospital in Orlando, Florida, until such report is submitted. Title II: Strategic Planning for Health Care Resources - Directs the Secretary, based on an analysis and recommendations of the Under Secretary for Health, to submit to the veterans' committees an annual report regarding long-range health planning of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Directs the Secretary to report annually to such committees showing the current Department priorities (listing the top 20) for proposed major medical construction projects. (Sec. 202) Specifies additional information required to be included in a prospectus submitted by the Secretary to the veterans' committees in connection with proposed medical facilities. (Sec. 203) States that the definition of \"major medical facility project\" shall include a project involving a total expenditure of more than $5 million in the case of a project which is principally for the alteration of a medical facility in order to provide additional space for the provision of ambulatory care. Repeals a provision of the Veterans' Medical Programs Amendments of 1992 which makes inapplicable to projects for which funds were appropriated prior to the enactment of such Act a prohibition on the appropriation, obligation, or expenditure of funds for any major medical facility project unless funds for such project have been specifically authorized by law. Prohibits the Secretary from obligating funds in excess of $500,000 from the Advance Planning Fund of the Department toward design or development of a major medical facility project until the Secretary submits a report to the veterans' committees on the proposed obligation and 30 days have passed since the receipt of such report. (Sec. 205) Requires the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to include such professional and auxiliary services as the Secretary finds necessary to carry out VHA functions. Requires the Under Secretary for Health to ensure that his office is staffed so as to provide appropriate expertise. Amends Federal provisions concerning the Office of the Under Secretary to: (1) repeal the requirement that the Associate Deputy Under Secretary for Health be a qualified doctor of medicine; (2) no longer require such Office to include a Director of Nursing Service, Pharmacy Service, Dietetic Service, Podiatric Service, and Optometric Service; and (3) no longer require one Assistant Under Secretary for Health to be a qualified doctor of dental surgery or dental medicine and another to be a qualified physician trained in geriatrics."
