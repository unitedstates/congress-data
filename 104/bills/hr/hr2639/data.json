Prohibits a Member of Congress (including the Speaker of the House of Representatives and any Majority or Minority Leader or Whip of either chamber) from using Government-funded vehicles or personnel for purposes of transportation during any period referred to in this Act, except for a medical emergency. Provides that the congressional gymnasiums, during such period, shall be deemed as non-essential and remain closed."
