Directs the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the Missouri Wild Horse League or another qualified nonprofit entity: (1) to provide for cost-effective management of such horses; and (2) which limits Federal expenditures to the cost of monitoring the agreement. Directs the Secretary to issue permits for adequate pastures to accommodate the historic population level of the free-roaming horse herd which shall be at least the number of horses in existence on this Act's enactment but not more than 50. Prohibits the Secretary from removing, assisting in, or permitting the removal of any free-roaming horses from Federal lands within the boundary of the Riverways unless: (1) the entity with whom the Secretary enters into the agreement fails to meet the terms and conditions of the agreement; (2) the number of such horses exceeds 50; or (3) such action is necessary in an emergency to protect public health and safety. Provides that nothing in the Act shall be construed as creating additional liability for the United States for any property damage caused by the horses."
