    "text": "Palmetto Bend Project Title Transfer Act - Requires the Secretary of the Interior to enter into an agreement with the Lavaca Navidad River Authority, or with both the Authority and Texas Water Development Board if the project is held jointly, for the transfer of the Palmetto Bend Project, Texas, for a specified sum payable to the United States. Subjects such agreement to specified assumptions of project responsibilities and liabilities by the State of Texas or the transferee. Finds that the assumption of Federal nonreimbursable responsibility by Texas and the transferee of the Project is in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, thereby obviating project purchase review."
