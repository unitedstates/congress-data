    "text": "Long-Term Care Insurance Standards and Consumer Protection Act of 1995 - Amends the Social Security Act to require the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) or, if NAIC does not, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to establish minimum Federal standards for long-term care insurance policies that incorporate specified requirements. Prohibits the offering of a long-term care insurance policy in a State unless the State has an approved regulatory program, or the policy has been certified by the State. Requires NAIC to: (1) issue guidelines governing endorsements for long-term care insurance policies; (2) establish requirements for long-term insurance agent training and certification; and (3) establish a Steering Committee on Long-Term Care Insurance Standards in order to make recommendations concerning such minimum Federal standards. Provides for enforcement of standards. Sets forth conditions for the approval of State regulatory programs by the Secretary. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to study, develop, and report to the appropriate congressional committees on a standard measure of value for long-term care policies."
