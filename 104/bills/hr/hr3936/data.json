(Sec. 102) Amends Federal law to include reentry vehicles and launch and reentry operations within the scope of commercial space launch activities. Mandates an annual report. (Sec. 103) Amends Federal law and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act to except from certain post-employment restrictions employees or former employees of NASA seeking employment with an entity that is awarded the Space Flight Operations Contract for the Space Shuttle, with specified exceptions. (Sec. 104) Amends the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1993 to: (1) discontinue funding of the commercial launch voucher demonstration program through the Office of Commercial Programs within NASA (continues funding such program directly through NASA); and (2) extend the program indefinitely. (Sec. 105) Encourages the President to promote U.S. Global Positioning System standards. (Sec. 106) Directs NASA to purchase, to the maximum extent possible, space science data from the private sector. Title II: Remote Sensing - Makes amendments to the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992 respecting the commercialization of land remote sensing space systems. Modifies license application and issuance requirements to allow U.S. Government agencies to enter into agreements for utilization of a private land remote sensing space system if such remote sensing space system will be licensed by the Secretary of Commerce before commencing its commercial operation. Prohibits duplication of commercial space science data collection or distribution activities by the Federal Government unless such activities would result in significant cost savings to the Federal Government. Repeals the technology demonstration program. (Sec. 202) Directs the Administrator to: (1) acquire space-based and airborne Earth remote sensing data provided by the private sector for purposes of meeting Government goals for Mission to Planet Earth; and (2) conduct a study to determine the extent to which baseline scientific requirements of Mission to Planet Earth can be met by the private sector, and how NASA will meet such requirements which cannot be met by the private sector. Requires that: (1) the determination of baseline scientific requirements be carried out by the Goddard Space Flight Center; (2) the Commercial Sensing Program at the Stennis Space Center identify private sector Earth remote sensing data that can meet the scientific requirements of Mission to Planet Earth; and (3) the Administrator to determine the extent to which the baseline requirements of Mission to Planet Earth can be met by the private sector and ensure that the Stennis Space Center plays a major coordinating role. Title III: Federal Acquisition of Space Transportation Services - Requires the Federal Government to procure space transportation services from the private sector whenever such services are required in the course of its activities, subject to exception. (Sec. 303) Repeals amendments to the Launch Services Purchase Act of 1990 regarding commercial launch services provisions. (Sec. 304) Provides for authorized Federal uses of excess intercontinental ballistic missiles."
