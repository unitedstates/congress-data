Absolves Federal employees of personal liability for civil penalties under water pollution control laws for acts or omissions within the scope of official duties. Makes Federal employees subject to criminal sanctions under Federal or State water pollution control laws, but prohibits applying criminal sanctions to Federal agencies. Permits the imposition of civil penalties or the issuance of compliance orders against Federal agencies determined to be in violation of specified water pollution control or permit requirements. Authorizes the suspension or revocation of permits. Provides for the deposit of penalties into a fund to be used for water remediation and other restorative and preventive projects at Federal facilities. Includes Federal agencies within the definition of \"person\" for purposes of such Act."
