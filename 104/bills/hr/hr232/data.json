Repeals the income tax deductions currently permitted in connection with: (1) dividends received by a corporation; (2) dividends received by a corporation on the preferred stock of a public utility; and (3) dividends paid by a public utility on its preferred stock. Increases from 80 percent to 85 percent the deductible percentage of amounts received by a corporation from a qualified ten-percent owned foreign corporation."
