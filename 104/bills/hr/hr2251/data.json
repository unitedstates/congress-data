Prohibits the contract from being terminable for nonuse of water before December 31, 2001, and thereafter, only in accordance with the terms of the contract as amended pursuant to this Act. Grants authorization to join the United States as a party to any suit brought to enforce the Secretary's obligations to perform the provisions of this Act. Waives any claim by the United States to sovereign immunity from such suit."
