(Sec. 102) Retains State investigation and enforcement authority with respect to: (1) securities fraud or deceit; and (2) certain notice filings and fee requirements. Allows continued State collection of filing and registration fees as in effect before enactment of this Act, until State law or regulation adopted after enactment of this Act provides otherwise. Provides a three-year period after enactment of this Act during which a State securities commission may require the registration of securities whose issuer refuses to pay such fees. Directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to study and report to the Congress on the extent to which uniformity of State regulatory requirements for securities has been achieved for non-covered securities. (Sec. 103) Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to preempt State law with respect to capital, margin, recordkeeping, bonding, and reporting requirements. (Sec. 104) Exempts certain national securities exchange members, brokers, and dealers from Federal margin requirements. Repeals the borrowing and lending restrictions imposed upon members, brokers, and dealers of a national securities exchange. (Sec. 105) Amends the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to grant the SEC general exemptive authority regarding registration requirements (but not authority to exempt persons, securities, transactions, or classes of these, from government securities or government securities broker, dealer, and associated person requirements, rules, and regulations). (Sec. 106) Amends specified securities laws to direct the SEC to consider whether an action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation whenever it is required to consider the impact of an action upon investor protection pursuant to a rulemaking function. (Sec. 107) Prescribes guidelines for the SEC to examine and report to the Congress on proposals for the privatization of the EDGAR system. (Sec. 108) Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to mandate that the SEC and certain self-regulatory organizations (\"examining authorities\") coordinate their examination functions according to prescribed guidelines in order to eliminate duplication in the examination process. Prescribes general requirements for confidentiality of information as well as appropriate disclosure to the Congress or a Federal agency, or in compliance with a Federal court order. (Sec. 109) Directs the SEC to adopt rules under the Securities Act of 1933 concerning the registration status of foreign press conferences and foreign press releases by persons engaged in securities transactions. Title II: Investment Company Act Amendments - Investment Company Act Amendments of 1996 - Amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to exempt from certain acquisition prohibitions the securities of a registered open-end investment company (or a registered unit investment trust) acquired by another such company belonging to the same group of investment companies if specified circumstances apply. (Sec. 203) Revises requirements for the amendment of registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933 relating to securities issued by face-amount certificate companies, open-end management companies, or unit investment trusts. Repeals provisions for an increase in the number of securities specified in a registration, and deems any such registration to be for an indefinite number of securities. Prescribes formulae for the determination of registration fees, including interest due on late payments. (Sec. 204) Directs the SEC to permit the use of a prospectus containing substantive information not included in the prospectus specified in the Securities Act, but which shall be deemed permitted under such Act. (Sec. 205) Prescribes guidelines for the sale of variable insurance contracts. (Sec. 206) Repeals the requirement that a registered investment company file quarterly or semi-annual reports with the SEC. Requires the SEC to take specified steps to avoid unnecessary reporting and minimize the compliance burdens upon registered investment companies and their affiliated persons when exercising its authority to require the filing of information on a basis more frequently than semi-annually, and in the maintenance and preservation of requisite records. (Sec. 207) Revises the guidelines for: (1) the maintenance and preservation of investment company records for the SEC; and (2) annual reports to the SEC and shareholders.

Declares that no offsetting collection fees shall be collected for any fiscal year except to the extent provided in advance in appropriations Acts. States that any such fees collected during any fiscal year, except in excess of certain levels, shall be deposited and credited as offsetting collections to the account providing appropriations to the SEC. States that, if on the first day of a fiscal year a regular appropriation to the SEC has not been enacted, the SEC shall continue to collect fees for off-exchange-trades of last-sale-reported securities (as offsetting collections) at the preceding fiscal year rate, until such regular appropriation is enacted. Sets forth annual due dates for all fees. Requires annual publication of fee rates in the Federal Register.
