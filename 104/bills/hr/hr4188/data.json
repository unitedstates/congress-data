Directs the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with the Fort Peck Tribal Executive Board with respect to all phases of the System. Provides construction requirements. Prohibits the obligation of construction funds until: (1) certain environmental mitigation requirements have been met; and (2) a final engineering report has been approved by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to issue a public notice finding that plans for the System include prudent and responsible water conservation measures which are economically and financially feasible. Requires the System to utilize power for its operation from the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program. Authorizes appropriations for planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the System."
