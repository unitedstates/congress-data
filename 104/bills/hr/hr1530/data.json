Amends the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (OFPPA) to require public notice of solicitations for Federal contracts for property or services expected to exceed $10,000 but not to exceed $25,000.

Outlines actions required of procurement officers when contacted by offerors of a contract in which the officer is a substantial participant. Outlines provisions prohibiting a former employee of a Federal agency from accepting compensation from a contractor for a period of one year after such employee has completed work on a contract that was awarded to such contractor.
