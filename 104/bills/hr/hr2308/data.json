Makes available, in lieu of the Official Mail Allowance with respect to Members of the House, amounts for official mail under the Member's Representational Allowance, as allocated by the House Committee on House Oversight. Establishes a spending allowance for official mail with respect to House officers and employees. Makes such allowances available in the same manner and to the same extent as the Official Mail Allowance, except that they shall be used to purchase approved forms of postage rather than to pay for franked mail. Directs the Chief Administrative Officer of the House to take necessary actions to provide for use of postage meters to record the cost and volume of official mail under this Act."
