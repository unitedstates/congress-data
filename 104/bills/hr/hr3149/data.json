Declares that it is not illegal for a health care practitioner to administer a drug or device approved under this Act to a terminally ill patient if the practitioner has notified the patient that the drug or device is not FDA-approved and is experimental and if the practitioner has received written approval from the patient or the patient's representative. Requires a practitioner to report acute harm done by such a drug or device. Requires the Secretary to give public notice of the benefits and harm caused by such a drug or device."
