Requires that risk assessments conducted under the Act: (1) provide scientifically objective and unbiased estimates and characterizations which neither minimize nor exaggerate the nature and magnitude of risks to human health and the environment; (2) distinguish scientific findings from other considerations; and (3) be based on relevant and current scientific, technical, and exposure-related information, including epidemiological data, data on bioavailability, and site-specific information. Requires the President to publish guidelines which, among other requirements, define the use of probabilistic modeling, population risk estimates, and approaches for addressing cumulative potential risks posed by multiple contaminants or multiple exposure pathways. Requires further that the guidelines provide methodology for establishing protective exposure levels that are set, to the extent feasible and scientifically appropriate, at the final 90th percentile of exposure probability distribution. Directs the President to conduct a review and assessment of the health effects values and toxicological profiles of 25 specified hazardous substances considered to be carcinogens. Requires publication of the finalized assessment with explanations of assumptions, inferences, models, and other factors.
