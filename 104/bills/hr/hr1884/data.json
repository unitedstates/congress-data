    "text": "School Bus Safety Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe Federal proficiency standards for school bus drivers who are required to possess a commercial driver's license to operate a school bus. Requires the Secretary, in prescribing such standards, to authorize States to establish their own proficiency standards in lieu of the Federal standards if the Secretary determines they are as rigorous as the Federal standards. Requires bus drivers to demonstrate their proficiency in operating a school bus in accordance with either the Federal or State standards. (Sec. 4) Directs the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to develop and disseminate guidelines on the safe transportation in school buses of children under the age of five. (Sec. 5) Amends Federal transportation law to require the Secretary to issue regulations making Federal commercial motor carrier safety regulations applicable to all interstate school operations by local educational agencies. Directs the Secretary to develop an education program informing all local educational agencies that they must comply with such regulations when providing interstate transportation on a school bus to and from school-sanctioned and school-related activities. (Sec. 6) Amends the Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems Act of 1991 to require the Secretary, in deciding which projects to fund under such Act, to ensure that one or more operational tests advance the use and reduce the cost of intelligent vehicle-highway system technologies (including hazard warning systems or sensors) that alert school bus drivers of pedestrians or vehicles in, or approaching, the path of a school bus. (Sec. 7) Requires the Secretary to ensure that each State receiving Federal aid to conduct highway safety programs utilizes a portion of it (at least $1 million per fiscal year) to conduct traffic engineering activities to improve the safe operation of school buses. (Sec. 8) Requires the Secretary to begin a rulemaking process to determine the feasibility of certain safety and access requirements for school buses. (Sec. 9) Requires the Secretary, in carrying out highway safety research and development projects, to provide for the dissemination of information on school bus safety. (Sec. 10) Prohibits a local educational agency, and any contractor providing transportation services to such agency, from employing a person as a school bus driver before the completion of a background check of the person in the national criminal history background check system. Requires State criminal background check procedures to meet the guidelines set forth in the National Child Protection Act of 1993. Declares that no local educational agency or contractor providing it with transportation services shall be liable in an action for damages on the basis of a criminal conviction of a person employed as a school bus driver if a criminal background check was conducted but the conviction was not disclosed. (Sec. 11) Requires the Secretary to study and report to specified congressional committees on school bus safety. (Sec. 12) Requires the Secretary to: (1) issue a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to minimum reporting criteria on traffic-related deaths and injuries under State highway safety programs; and (2) issue a final rule establishing such criteria. (Sec. 13) Authorizes appropriations."
