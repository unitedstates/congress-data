Outlines provisions for determining the annual surplus of the trust funds. Prohibits disinvestment of trust fund amounts from public debt obligations, any refraining from making such investments, or any delay in making normal deposits in such trust funds for public debt limit-related purposes. Authorizes the sale of trust fund public debt obligations for the payment of cash benefits and administrative expenses, with conditions, including notification to each House of Congress and the Comptroller General at least three days in advance of such sale."
