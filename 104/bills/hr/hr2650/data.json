Modifies the definition of an \"eligible prisoner\" to mean a prisoner who is determined by the Bureau of Prisons to have a substance abuse problem and who is within 24 months of the date of release or is otherwise designated by the Bureau for participation in a residential substance abuse treatment program (currently, who is willing to participate in such a program)."
