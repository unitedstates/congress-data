    "text": "Trinity River Basin Fish and Wildlife Management Reauthorization Act of 1995 - Amends the Trinity River Basin Fish and Wildlife Management Act of 1984 (as named by this Act) to revise and extend the management program for restoration of fish and wildlife in the Trinity River Basin. (Sec. 2) Provides that Trinity Basin fisheries restoration is to be measured not only by returning adult anadromous fish spawners, but by the ability of dependent tribal, commercial, and sport fisheries to participate fully, through enhanced in-river and ocean harvest opportunities, in the benefits of restoration. Declares that the Secretary of the Interior requires additional authority to implement a management program, in conjunction with other agencies, to achieve the long-term goals of restoring fish and wildlife populations in the Trinity River Basin, and to the extent these restored populations will contribute to ocean populations of adult salmon, steelhead, and other anadromous fish, such management program will aid in the resumption of commercial, including ocean harvest, and recreational fishing activities. (Sec. 3) Revises such management program to require the Secretary to consult with the Secretary of Commerce on certain matters, where appropriate. Declares that such program is intended, to the extent these restored populations will contribute to ocean populations of adult salmon, steelhead, and other anadromous fish, to aid in the resumption of commercial, including ocean harvest, and recreational fishing activities. Revises the management program to include ocean fish levels and fish habitats in the Klamath River. Provides that modernization of the Trinity River Fish Hatchery is to mitigate fish habitat loss above Lewiston Dam while not impairing efforts to restore and maintain naturally reproducing fish stocks within the basin. (Sec. 4) Revises provisions for the Trinity River Basin Fish and Wildlife Task Force. Adds five members (to the current 14) and provides that such new members represent: (1) the Yurok Tribe; (2) the Karuk Tribe; (3) commercial fishing interests; (4) sport fishing interests; and (5) the timber industry. Directs the Secretary to appoint a designated representative to ensure coordination of actions and management and the exchange of information between such Trinity River Task Force and the Klamath River Basin Fisheries Task Force and the Klamath Fishery Management Council. Allows reimbursement of members of the Task Force who are not full-time officers or employees of the United States, the State of California (or a political subdivision thereof), or an Indian tribe. (Sec. 5) Extends for three years the period of availability of the authorization of appropriations for the management program for restoration of fish and wildlife in the Trinity River Basin. Authorizes the Secretary to accept in-kind services as payment for specified obligations incurred under the Act. Limits to 20 percent the portion of management program funds which may be used for overhead and indirect costs. Requires the Secretary to: (1) submit annual financial reports to specified congressional committees; and (2) conduct periodic programmatic audits of the in-river fishery monitoring and enforcement programs under the Act. Authorizes the Secretary, beginning in the fiscal year immediately following completion of the restoration effort, to seek appropriations to monitor, evaluate, and maintain program investments and fish and wildlife populations in the Trinity River Basin for the purpose of achieving long-term fish and wildlife restoration goals. (Sec. 6) Provides that nothing in the Act shall be construed as establishing or affecting any past, present, or future rights of any Indian or Indian tribe or any other individual or entity."
