Provides reimbursement for specified types of relocation expenses which are currently not reimbursable. Title II: Miscellaneous Provisions - Repeals the long-distance telephone call certification requirement. (Sec. 202) Authorizes the Administrator of General Services to require that Federal employees use the travel charge card established pursuant to the United States Travel and Transportation Payment and Expense Control System or any Federal contractor-issued travel card issued for all payments of expenses of official Government travel. Allows the Administrator to exempt payments from any requirement established under the preceding sentence in certain cases. Amends the Right to Privacy Act of 1978 to permit the disclosure of any financial record or information to a Government authority in conjunction with a Federal contractor-issued travel charge card issued for official Government travel. (Sec. 203) Revises provisions concerning the responsibilities and potential liabilities of disbursing and certifying officials with respect to transportation expenses. (Sec. 204) Provides for the reimbursement of Federal, State, and local income taxes incurred by a Federal employee on money received for travel expenses."
