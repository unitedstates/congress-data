Eliminates the requirement, with respect to such services performed by a nurse practitioner, that they be performed in a skilled nursing facility or other specified nursing facility. Covers, in addition, other services and supplies incidental to such services. Revises the formula for payment from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for such services (thereby increasing such payment). Repeals the rural area restriction on services performed by nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists for which direct payment may be made. Requires a ten percent bonus payment from the Fund for services of a nurse practitioner or clinical nurse specialist furnished in a health professional shortage area."
