Authorizes the Secretary to submit proposals for legislation authorizing such a nomination. Requires the Secretary to object to the inclusion of any property in the United States on the list of World Heritage in Danger (established under the Convention) unless the Secretary: (1) has submitted to specified congressional officials a report describing the necessity for such inclusion; and (2) is specifically authorized to assent to the inclusion by a joint resolution of the Congress enacted after the report is submitted. Requires the Secretary to report annually to the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of specified congressional committees on each World Heritage Site within the United States regarding: (1) an accounting of all money expended to manage the Site; (2) a summary of Federal full time equivalent hours related to its management; (3) a list and explanation of all nongovernmental organizations contributing to such management; and (4) a summary and account of the disposition of complaints received by the Secretary related to it. (Sec. 4) Amends the National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 1980 to prohibit Federal officials from nominating lands in the United States for designation as a Biosphere Reserve under the Man and Biosphere Program of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. Provides that such designation of an area in the United States shall not have, and shall not be given, any force or effect, unless the Biosphere Reserve: (1) is specifically authorized by a law enacted before December 31, 1999; (2) consists solely of federally-owned lands; and (3) is subject to a management plan that specifically ensures that the use of intermixed or adjacent non-Federal property is not limited or restricted as a result of that designation. Requires the Secretary of State to report annually to the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of specified congressional committees on each Biosphere Reserve within the United States regarding: (1) an accounting of all money expended to manage the Reserve; (2) a summary of Federal full time equivalent hours related to its management; (3) a list and explanation of all nongovernmental organizations contributing to such management; and (4) a summary and account of the disposition of complaints received by the Secretary related to it. (Sec. 5) Prohibits, under any international agreement, the nomination, classification, or designation of: (1) federally-owned lands located within the United States for a special or restricted use unless authorized by law; (2) State or local government lands unless authorized by State or local law; or (3) privately owned lands without the owner's consent. Provides that such prohibition shall not apply to: (1) sites nominated under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat (popularly known as the Ramsar Convention); (2) agreements established under the North American Wetlands Conservation Act; and (3) conventions referred to in the Fish and Wildlife Improvement Act of 1978."
