Authorizes the guidance to be incorporated into State implementation plans. Requires States, within two years of the promulgation of regulations relating to emission control diagnostics, to submit revisions to programs to meet prescribed requirements. Provides that the rule regarding vehicle inspection and maintenance programs published in the Federal Register on November 5, 1992, shall cease to be effective. Authorizes States with implementation plans that contain provisions for enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance programs to submit, revise, or amend such plans within one year of publication of the Administrator's guidance. Amends the Clean Air Act to authorize (currently, requires) States to comply with the Administrator's guidance for enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance programs in Serious, Severe, and Extreme nonattainment areas. Permits (currently, requires) specified minimum elements to be included in such programs."
