    "text": "Unified Intra-State Gaming Rules Act - Amends the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to revise conditions for regulation of certain types of gaming activities on Indian lands. Revises such conditions with respect to the regulation of Class II and Class III gaming activities to specify that these shall be limited to the specific forms of, and methods of play for, those gaming activities expressly authorized by the law of the State. Excludes video bingo from the definition of class II gaming. Includes video bingo, and any other forms of electronic video games or devices, as well as slot machines, within the definition of class III gaming. Shifts the burden of proof from a State to an Indian tribe in a compact negotiation-related action initiated by a tribe. Increases the membership of the National Indian Gaming Commission. Includes, under provisions for determining whether gaming activities on newly acquired Indian lands are to be allowed, consideration of communities across State borders that would be seriously affected, as well as consultation with officials of such communities."
