    "text": "Runaway and Homeless Youth Amendments of 1996 - Renames the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act the Comprehensive Runaway and Homeless Youth Services Act (the Act). Revises findings of the Act, including by specifying that services for runaway and homeless youth are needed in urban, suburban, and rural areas. Modifies the Act to require: (1) the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to entities to establish and operate comprehensive local runaway and homeless youth services programs and, in selecting among grant applicants, to ensure that at least 20 percent of the total amount available for such grants for each fiscal year be used for long-term residential care for older homeless youth through the provision of transitional living services; and (2) an applicant, to be eligible for such assistance, to propose to establish, strengthen, or fund an existing or proposed locally controlled comprehensive runaway and homeless youth services program that meets specified requirements. Permits a program eligible for assistance to be located in any urban, suburban, or rural area where a need for runaway and homeless youth is demonstrated. Specifies that youth eligible to receive services from such programs are individuals age 21 or younger. Modifies general plan requirements to require that applicants, to be eligible for assistance, provide or make referrals regarding: (1) alcohol and drug abuse prevention and education activities and services; and (2) appropriate medical, educational, social, recreational, and transportation services. Sets forth or modifies provisions concerning plan requirements for programs providing short-term emergency shelter and long-term residential services, approval of applications by the Secretary, evaluation authority, reporting requirements, and the authorization of appropriations. Directs the Secretary to develop and implement a system that provides information on the quality and quantity of services being provided by comprehensive runaway and homeless youth services programs. Requires grant recipients to cooperate with Federal data collection efforts and with triennial on-site monitoring activities. Repeals provisions regarding: (1) authority under the Act for street-based and home-based services; (2) temporary demonstration projects to provide services to youth in rural areas; (3) specified requirements regarding informational assistance to potential grantees; and (4) annual program priorities."
