Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) consideration of health effects that may be experienced by groups within the general population, such as infants and travelers, that are potentially at greater risk; (2) the conduct of research in consultation with interested States and based on the best available, peer-reviewed science and supporting studies; and (3) notice, time, and rulemaking requirements for promulgating such standard."
