Modifies the area within which the use of motorboats with motors no greater than 25 horsepower is permitted to include Pipestone Bay of Basswood and that portion of Jackfish Bay of Basswood generally south of the narrows at the north end of Jackfish Bay. Repeals a provision specifying that nothing in such law shall be construed to limit mechanical portages or the horsepower of motors used on motorboats on Loon Lake, Saint Louis County, and that portion of the Lac La Croix, Saint Louis County, south of Snow Bay and east of Wilkins Bay. Makes the provisions of an executive order establishing an airspace reservation over certain areas of the Superior National Forest, Minnesota, applicable to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Title II: The Voyageurs National Park Preservation Act - Designates the Voyageurs National Park Wilderness. Directs that such Wilderness, subject to valid existing rights, be administered by the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with applicable provisions of the Wilderness Act. Requires the Secretary to continue to provide for the use of existing safety portages for snowmobiles."
