    "text": "Federal Communications Commission Authorization Act of 1995 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 (the Act) to authorize appropriations for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for FY 1996. Derives a portion of the sum of such appropriations in each fiscal year from an amount determined by the establishment and adjustment of application and regulatory fees under the Act. Directs the FCC to submit to the appropriate congressional committees and publish in the Federal Register semiannual reports specifying the reimbursements which the FCC has accepted from non-Federal sources for travel and related expenses of FCC employees. Amends the Federal Communications Commission Authorization Act of 1988 to authorize the FCC during FY 1996 to make grants to, or enter into cooperative agreements with, private nonprofit organizations designated under the Older Americans Act. Directs the FCC to modify, for FY 1996 and thereafter, the application fees so that total collections for the fiscal year equal $40 million plus the amount of necessary expenses for costs related to application processing which exceeds $40 million. Directs the FCC to notify the Congress of any proposed and adopted modifications. Requires $40 million from FCC application fees to be deposited into the Treasury and used for application processing and related expenses of the FCC. Revises the schedule of application fees for personal communications services and amateur vanity call signs under the Act. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) use of such moneys; (2) recovery of executive and legal costs incurred by the FCC; (3) establishment and adjustment of fees; (4) regulatory fees for satellite television operations; and (5) governmental entities use for common carrier purposes. Directs the FCC to: (1) develop accounting systems for making adjustments authorized by this Act; and (2) annually prepare and submit to the Congress an analysis of such systems and afford interested persons the opportunity to submit comments concerning the allocation of costs, as well as the application and regulatory fee adjustments. Authorizes the FCC to: (1) designate an entity to make inspections of ship radio stations; and (2) require such inspections annually, with an authorized waiver under limited circumstances. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) expedited Instructional Television Fixed Service processing; (2) tariff rejection authority; (3) refund authority; (4) licensing of aviation, maritime, and personal radio services by rule; (5) forfeitures for violations imperiling safety of life; (6) the use of experts and consultants; and (7) the statute of limitations for forfeiture proceedings against common carriers. Directs the FCC to report to the Congress on the existing and future use of the FM band to facilitate the use of auditory assistive devices for individuals with hearing impairments."
