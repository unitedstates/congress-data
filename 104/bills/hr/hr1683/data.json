    "text": "Public Employee Pension Plan Liability Act of 1995 - Permits a participant or beneficiary under a public employee pension plan to bring a civil action against the plan to: (1) recover benefits due him or her under the plan's terms, to enforce his or her rights, or to clarify his or her rights to future benefits; (2) enjoin any act or practice which violates the plan's terms; or (3) obtain other appropriate equitable relief to enforce such terms or redress violations of them. Allows a plaintiff, in most instances, to prevail in such an action by proving the case by a preponderance of the evidence. Requires proof by clear and convincing evidence, however, if the action involves a plan under which changes in employer contributions are subject to review by a qualified review board. Grants State courts and U.S. district courts concurrent jurisdiction of such actions. Precribes the general requirements for a qualified review board. States that in general this Act applies to any public employee pension plan, with specified exceptions."
