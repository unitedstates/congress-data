(Sec. 104) Subjects FSHCs and certain foreign bank operations to the same restrictions on affiliate transactions that are imposed upon Federal Reserve member banks. Authorizes the appropriate Federal regulatory agency (the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Reserve Board, the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), or the Federal Home Loan Bank Board) to adopt rules and regulations to prevent an insured depository institution that is controlled by an FSHC from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices. Authorizes the appropriate Federal banking agency, with the concurrence of the national Financial Services Committee, to exempt any FSHC-controlled depository institution from any Federal Reserve Act requirement. Requires an FSHC-controlled depository institution (except certain foreign-controlled banks) to obtain the authorization of the National Financial Services Committee before entering into certain credit, indemnity, guarantee, or insurance activities on behalf of any affiliate that is neither a financial services institution nor primarily engaged in financial activities. (Sec. 105) Requires that each insured depository institution that is controlled by an FSHC be well capitalized. Requires any FSHC controlling an undercapitalized insured depository institution to: (1) enter into an agreement with the appropriate Federal regulatory agency to return the institution to being well capitalized; or (2) divest control of such bank or institution. Prohibits the appropriate Federal banking agency from imposing any requirements pertaining to the capitalization of an FSHC. (Sec. 106) Subjects interstate acquisitions of an insured bank by an FSHC to the same restrictions as are applicable to bank holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. (Sec. 107) Prohibits Federal and State regulatory agencies from enacting laws that discriminate against FSHCs or their affiliates. Preempts any Federal or State provision inconsistent with the purposes of this Act. (Sec. 108) Subjects FSHCs to the tying provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 and to the insider lending prohibitions of the Federal Reserve Act. Subjects an FSHC and its nonbanking subsidiaries to certain limitations on tie-in arrangements imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board upon bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries with respect to extending credit, leasing or selling property, providing any service, or fixing or varying the consideration for any such transaction. (Sec. 109) Sets forth reporting, examination and enforcement guidelines, including guidelines for divestiture and criminal penalties in the event the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that a depository institution has engaged in a continuing course of conduct involving its FSHC which may affect the safety and soundness of such institution. (Sec. 110) Provides for administrative (including divestiture), criminal, and civil penalties for specified violations of this Act, as well as judicial review of adverse administrative orders. (Sec. 114) Establishes a National Financial Services Committee to: (1) establish uniform principles and standards for the examination and supervision of financial services institutions and FSHCs; and (2) to recommend to the Congress uniformity in other supervisory matters, as well as additional measures to strengthen the separation of insured banks and institutions controlled by FSHCs from the activities of their affiliates. Prescribes notice procedure guidelines for determining new financial services institutions and new financial activities. Subtitle B: Securities Activities of Financial Services Holding Companies - Prescribes guidelines under which an FSHC with a securities affiliate may not permit a depository institution under its control to engage in underwriting securities (except those expressly authorized by Federal law as permissible for a national bank). (Sec. 122) Prohibits a depository institution with a securities affiliate, except in certain circumstances, from extending credit to the affiliate (or purchasing its financial assets), to enhance the marketability of securities underwritten by the securities affiliate. Prohibits an FSHC, with certain exceptions, from extending or arranging for the extension of credit secured by or for the purpose of purchasing a security (or making payments on principal) that is the subject of a distribution in which an affiliate of the FSHC participates as underwriter or member of a selling group. Prohibits an FSHC with a securities affiliate, with certain exceptions, from extending credit to an issuer of securities underwritten by such securities affiliate for the purpose of making payments on those securities. Requires the appropriate Federal banking agency to prescribe circumstances under which directors and senior executive officers of a securities affiliate may serve simultaneously as directors or senior executive officers of an affiliated depository institution. Exempts small FSHCs (with total assets under $500 million) and certain foreign affiliates from such regulations. Prescribes public disclosure requirements for securities affiliates and insured depository institutions. Prohibits a securities affiliate from underwriting securities secured by or representing an interest in mortgages or other obligations originated or purchased by an affiliated depository institution, unless one of four specified requirements is met. Proscribes certain reciprocal arrangements between FSHCs. Allocates Federal oversight responsibilities among the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the appropriate Federal banking agencies. Prescribes circumstances in which a branch, agency, or commercial lending company that is operated by a foreign bank that is a financial services holding company is not subject to specified limitations placed upon securities activities of depository institutions with securities affiliates. Exempts a wholesale financial institution and transactions between it and its securities affiliates, from the requirements of this section, except those providing for additional safeguards and certain compliance programs. Applies this same exemption to a national market lending institution controlled by an FSHC. States that Federal prescriptions governing the FSHCs are subject to the approval of the National Financial Services Committee (NFSC). (Sec. 123) States that the NFSC shall prescribe standards applicable to any FSHC affiliated-depository institution that is not an SEC-registered broker, but effects retail securities transactions.

(Sec. 304) Exempts loans made by a member bank (or any other person that has entered into a certain kind of agreement with the Federal Reserve Board) to a broker or dealer from Board-prescribed margin requirements if the loan proceeds are to be used in the ordinary course of business (other than for the purpose of funding securities purchases for the account of such broker or dealer). Subtitle B: Investment Company Provisions - Amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to permit: (1) custody of investment company assets by an affiliated bank (or an affiliated person of such bank); and (2) a unit investment trust to designate an affiliated bank as trustee (currently a prohibited practice). (Sec. 311) Permits the SEC to bring a civil action for breach of fiduciary duty involving personal misconduct against an FSHC- affiliated custodian of a registered investment company. (Sec. 312) States that an affiliate of an investment company for a bank must comply with SEC rules when lending money to an investment company. (Sec. 313) Modifies the definition of \"interested person\" with respect to an investment company to include any FSHC-affiliated person that, during the preceding six months, has executed one or more transactions of a specified kind. Prohibits a registered investment company from having a majority of its board of directors consisting of personnel or senior officers of any one FSHC-affiliated bank, or of any single FSHC (and its affiliates and subsidiaries). (Sec. 314) Modifies the guidelines pertaining to unlawful misrepresentation of guarantees and the deceptive use of names. (Sec. 315) Modifies the definition of \"broker\" to state that it does not include any person solely by reason of the fact that such person is an underwriter for one or more investment companies.

Amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to revise such exclusion guidelines for certain bank common trust funds.

Title V: Merger of Bank and Thrift Charters, Regulators, and Insurance Funds - Subtitle A: Conversion of Thrift Charters - Thrift Charter Conversion Act of 1996 - Prescribes procedural guidelines for the termination of Federal savings association charters and their conversion into national bank charters or State depository institution charters. Prohibits the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision from granting any charter for a Federal savings association.

Includes as State banks any cooperative bank or other unincorporated bank whose deposits were insured by the FDIC on the day before enactment of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 but excludes from State bank treatment any such banks whose deposits were not FDIC-insured before such date.

(Sec. 503) Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHCA) to permit continuation of grandfathered bank holding company activities and affiliations. Prohibits certain insured depository institutions from identifying themselves as national banks, but shields them from any liability for fraudulent misrepresentation for not representing themselves as a national bank. (Sec. 504) Sets forth transition provisions for: (1) activities of savings associations and mutual savings associations which have converted into or become treated as banks; and (2) registration of bank holding companies resulting from conversions of savings associations to banks, or treatment of savings associations as banks.
