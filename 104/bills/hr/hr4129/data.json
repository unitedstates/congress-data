    "text": "Freedom of Religious Expression Act of 1996 - States that students in public schools: (1) have the same right to engage in individual or group prayer and religious discussions in or connected with school as they do to engage in other comparable activity; (2) may express their beliefs about religion in the form of homework, artwork, and other written and oral assignments free from discrimination based on the religious content of their submissions; (3) have a right to distribute religious literature to their schoolmates on the same terms as they are permitted to distribute other literature that is unrelated to school curriculum or activities; and (4) may display or otherwise communicate religious messages, including on items of clothing, to the same extent they are permitted to display or communicate other messages. Allows a person aggrieved by a violation of this Act to obtain appropriate relief in a civil action against a governmental entity or any person engaging in the violation. Directs the Attorney General to establish a toll-free number to provide timely and accurate information and respond to questions regarding the rights protected by this Act. Reduces funds available for certain administrative expenses under the Higher Education Act for FY 1997 by a specified amount."
