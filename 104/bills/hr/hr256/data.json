    "text": "Fort Carson-Pinon Canyon Military Lands Withdrawal Act - Withdraws from appropriation under public land, mining, mineral, geothermal leasing, and mineral materials disposal laws, and reserves for military use by the Army, specified lands at the Fort Carson Military Reservation and Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site (both in Colorado). Requires the Secretary of the Army to manage such lands for military purposes covered by this Act and to authorize their use by other U.S. military agencies. Directs the Secretary, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior, to develop a management plan for such reserved and withdrawn lands. Terminates such land withdrawals and reservations 15 years after enactment of this Act. Requires the Secretary of the Army to: (1) decontaminate relinquished lands (but authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to refuse to accept lands if such decontamination is not practicable or economically feasible, if the lands cannot be decontaminated sufficiently to allow them to be opened to the operation of the public land laws, or if insufficient funds are appropriated for the purpose of decontaminating the lands); (2) if the Secretary of the Interior declines to accept jurisdiction of lands proposed for relinquishment under such provision or determines that some of the lands withdrawn by this Act are contaminated to an extent that prevents opening the contaminated lands to operation of the public land laws, warn the public of risks of entry, conduct only decontamination activities on such lands after the expiration of the withdrawal, and make a status report to the Secretary of the Interior and to the Congress; and (3) maintain a program of decontamination of the lands withdrawn by this Act at least at the level of effort carried out during FY 1992, subject to specified limitations. Directs that the United States be held harmless and not liable for any injuries or damages to persons or property suffered in the course of any mining, mineral activity, or geothermal leasing activity conducted on lands comprising the Fort Carson Reservation or Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site, including liabilities to non-Federal entities under specified provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 or the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Authorizes appropriations."
