Requires the focus of such negotiations to be to: (1) expedite the transfer of aliens unlawfully in the United States who are incarcerated in U.S. prisons; (2) ensure that a transferred prisoner serves the balance of the sentence imposed by the U.S. courts; and (3) eliminate any requirement of prisoner consent to such a transfer. Directs the President to certify whether each prisoner transfer treaty is effective in returning aliens unlawfully in the United States who are incarcerated in the United States to their country of citizenship. Requires the President, subject to such a certification, to direct the Border Patrol and Customs Service Academies to enroll foreign law enforcement personnel for training to enhance the following U.S. law enforcement goals: (1) drug interdiction and cross-border criminal activity; (2) the prevention of illegal immigration; and (3) the prevention of illegal entry of goods into the United States."
