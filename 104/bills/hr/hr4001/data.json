Imposes certain visa, economic, and defense export sanctions against such countries. Authorizes the President to waive such sanctions if such countries halt their assistance to Liberian factions, or such measures would not be in the U.S. national interest. Urges the President to take certain measures to bring Liberian war criminals to justice. Directs the President to instruct all U.S. Government officials engaged in official contacts with the governments of Cote d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, and Guinea to raise on a regular basis the issue of extraditing to the United States all persons in such countries sought by the Department of Justice for crimes committed in the United States. Expresses the sense of the Congress with respect to the institution of democracy in Liberia."
