    "text": "Water Quality Public Right-To-Know Act of 1996 - Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to require each community water system, at least annually, to publish in one or more local newspapers and mail to each such customer a report on the level of contaminants in the drinking water (consumer confidence report). Allows a local government to determine not to apply the mailing requirement to a system serving fewer than 3,300 persons if such system: (1) so informs its customers; (2) makes information available upon request to the public regarding water quality; and (3) publishes the public notice as required by this Act. Authorizes a State exercising primary enforcement responsibility to establish alternative requirements with respect to the form and content of the report."
