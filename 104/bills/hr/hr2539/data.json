Subjects local governmental authorities providing transportation services to Federal laws governing: (1) safety; (2) representation of employees for collective bargaining; and (3) employment retirement, annuity, and unemployment systems. Requires the Board to exempt a person, class of persons, or a transaction or service from its jurisdiction whenever: (1) application of this Act is not necessary to carry out U.S. rail transportation policy; and (2) either the transaction or service is of limited scope, or jurisdiction is not needed to protect shippers from the abuse of market power. Requires rail carriers subject to the jurisdiction of the Board to establish rates, classifications, through routes, rules and practices for rail transportation that are reasonable and that do not unreasonably discriminate against a participating carrier. Authorizes the Board to prescribe maximum rates, classifications, rules, practices, through routes, joint classifications, joint rates, and division of joint rates when it decides that: (1) the ones proposed by a rail carrier violate this Act; or (2) it is in the public interest. Requires the Board to establish procedures to ensure the expeditious handling of challenges to the reasonableness of railroad rates. Revises rail carrier provisions to provide for: (1) Board approval of rail carrier rate agreements; (2) Board market dominance determinations in rail rate proceedings; (3) rail carrier service contracts; (4) reduced rail rates for Government transportation; (5) prohibitions against unreasonable discrimination by rail carriers; (6) shipper's liability for payment of transportation rates; (7) designation of travel routes by shippers; (8) the licensing of persons for the construction and operation of railroad lines; (9) rail carrier procedures for the abandonment or discontinuance of railroad lines or railroad transportation; (10) the sale of railroad lines as required by public convenience and necessity; (11) requirements regarding the provision of rail carrier service and the use of terminal facilities; (12) a uniform accounting system, including depreciation charges; (13) records inspections; (14) special reports by rail carriers; (15) railroad cost accounting; (16) filing of equipment trusts and security interests with the Board; (17) Board approval over certain rail carrier transactions, including consolidations, mergers, and acquisitions; (18) certain restrictions on Board officers and directors; and (19) Board enforcement, including civil and criminal penalties for violations committed under this Act by rail carriers.

Grants the Secretary of Transportation (currently, the ICC) and the Board jurisdiction over motor carriers, water carriers, and freight forwarders, with specified exceptions.

(Sec. 104) Amends the Secretary's authority to approve State plans under which the State agrees to assume responsibility for enforcing Federal and compatible State commercial motor vehicle safety regulations to add the requirement that such a plan, among other things, ensure that the State will cooperate in the enforcement of certain motor carrier registration and insurance requirements.

Declares that the Board has jurisdiction over interstate transportation by pipeline, or by pipeline and railroad or water, when transporting a commodity other than water, gas, or oil. Requires the Board to exempt a person, class of persons, or a transaction or service from its jurisdiction whenever: (1) application of this Act is not necessary to carry out U.S. pipeline transportation policy; and (2) either the transaction or service is of limited scope, or application of this Act is not needed to protect shippers from the abuse of market power. Requires pipeline carriers subject to the jurisdiction of the Board to establish rates, classifications, through routes, rules, and practices for pipeline transportation that are reasonable and that do not unreasonably discriminate against a connecting line of any other pipeline, rail, or water carrier or line in the distribution of traffic that is not routed specifically by the shipper. Authorizes the Board to prescribe rates, classifications, rules, and practices when it decides that those proposed by a pipeline carrier violate this Act. Authorizes a pipeline carrier to provide without charge or at a reduced rate pipeline transportation or service to the U.S. Government. Sets forth administrative provisions with respect to: (1) general operation requirements with respect to pipeline carriers; (2) inspection of records of pipeline carriers and lessors; (3) enforcement, investigations, rights, and remedies; and (4) civil and criminal penalties. Title II: Surface Transportation Board - Amends Federal transportation law to establish the Surface Transportation Board within the Department of Transportation. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1996 through 1998. Establishes the Railroad-Shipper Transportation Advisory Council. Title III: Conforming Amendments - Amends or repeals specified Federal laws to conform them to this Act. Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions - Declares the licensing of a launch vehicle or launch site operator shall not be considered a major Federal action requiring an environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 if certain conditions exist. (Sec. 402) Amends Federal criminal law to impose penalties for destruction of a motor vehicle or train that carries radioactive waste. (Sec. 403) Amends Federal transportation law to direct the Secretary to establish sanctions and penalties for violations of laws regarding railroad-highway grade crossings by persons operating commercial vehicles.

(Sec. 406) Requires the Secretary to issue a final rule authorizing the continued use of fiber drum packaging with a removable head for the transportation of liquid hazardous materials if certain conditions are met. Requires the Secretary to study whether other standards with respect to fiber drum packaging will provide equal or greater safety for the transportation of liquid hazardous materials. (Sec. 407) Directs the Secretary to transmit to specified congressional committees a study that analyzes each of the noncontiguous domestic trades.
