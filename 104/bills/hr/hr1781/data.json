Declares the overall objective of the center to be to promote sustainable economic development throughout California by engaging in specified functions, including: (1) developing an ongoing program of applied environmental research, education, and outreach that the Federal, State, and local governments and the private sector can use; (2) fostering of public-private partnerships to find solutions to environmental problems of California; (3) bringing together university and college researchers to focus on California's most important environmental problems; (4) supporting activities such as the coordination and funding of research activities for the collection and evaluation of data, the conduct of seminars and educational programs, the conduct of a national conference, and the development of bachelors and masters degree programs to prepare individuals for employment as environmental professionals; and (5) working with other university research centers provided funds by EPA to help establish a National Environmental Outreach Program to assist governments and the private sector in programs to promote environmentally sound economic development. Authorizes the Center to provide undergraduate scholarships for individuals studying in environmental fields, assistantships and fellowships for graduate students to encourage study in fields related to sustainable economic development, and research grants to faculty at universities and colleges.
