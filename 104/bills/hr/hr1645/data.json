Requires the Program to be under the general supervision of a National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice and Firearms Safety, which shall replace the current National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice. Limits Program expenditures for any fiscal year to $5 million. Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to reserve for the Program all remaining M-1 Garand rifles and ammunition. Requires participants in Program activities to sign an affidavit that they: (1) have never been convicted of a firearms violation under Federal or State law; and (2) are not members of any organization which advocates the violent overthrow of the U.S. Government. Authorizes the commander of a major command of the armed forces (currently, either the President or the Secretary of the Army) to detail certain military officers and enlisted personnel to duty as instructors at rifle ranges for training civilians in the safe use of military arms. Authorizes the payment of travel and per diem costs for such personnel."
