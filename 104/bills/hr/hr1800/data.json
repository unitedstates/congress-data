Amends the Act to include Guam and American Samoa within the meaning of \"State\" and \"United States.\" Extends by two additional business days the current requirement that certain funds be available for withdrawal not later than one business day after receipt for deposit, if the deposit was made: (1) in an account at a depository institution located in Guam or American Samoa; and (2) by a check drawn on a originating depository institution which is not located in the same State as the receiving depository institution."
