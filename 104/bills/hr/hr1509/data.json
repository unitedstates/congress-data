Provides that any resolutions authorizing the issuance of obligations by such agency may provide for: (1) the payment of such an obligation from available revenues, including assets, property, or designated fees and taxes; and (2) the securing of such an obligation by the mortgage of real property or the creation of any security interest in available revenues. Provides that prohibitions against a District officer or employee obligating or expending any amount that has not been approved by an Act of Congress shall not apply to proceeds of, payments on, or amounts expended to secure such obligations. Provides that revenue bonds or other obligations issued by an agency may create a security interest in certain District revenues, including designated taxes or fees, as additional security for payment. Provides that such obligations shall not constitute general obligations of the District, a pledge of the faith and credit or taxing power of the District, a debt of the District, or lending of the public credit for private undertakings."
