Merges into the MRA the Clerk Hire Allowance, the Official Expenses Allowance, and the Official Mail Allowance. Makes such changes effective as of September 1, 1995. (Sec. 102) Authorizes the Committee on House Oversight to fix and adjust the MRA (currently, all allowances of the House) for Members and various House leadership. (Sec. 103) Allows the adjustment of MRAs for reasons other than those currently specified (price or technological changes or increases in the General Schedule) only by House resolution. (Sec. 104) Allows each House Member to employ under the MRA no more than 18 permanent clerks and four additional clerk hire employees in specified categories. Excludes interns and temporary employees from the operation of certain Federal employment provisions and requirements. (Sec. 105) Prohibits any payments from being made from applicable House accounts unless sanctioned by the Oversight Committee. (Sec. 106) Directs the Chief Administrative Officer of the House to submit semiannually to the House a detailed, itemized report of the disbursements for House operations. Outlines information required in such reports, with an exception in the case of vouchers of payments to individuals for attendance as witnesses before a congressional committee in executive session. (Sec. 107) Directs the Clerk of the House, at the request of a Member, to furnish to such Member for official use only one set of a privately published annotated version of the United States Code, including appropriate supplements and pocket parts. (Sec. 108) Authorizes the Chief of the Capitol Police to designate a member of such Police to be responsible for citation release with respect to bonds for persons arrested on Capitol grounds. Provides appropriate authority for D.C.'s Superior and U.S. District courts with respect to bond or collateral proceedings after such arrests. Title II: Technical and Conforming Amendments and Repeals Relating to Administrative Reforms in the House of Representatives - Makes various technical and conforming amendments and appropriate repeals to specified Federal provisions as necessitated by administrative reforms adopted in the House, including provisions concerning: (1) the election of Representatives; (2) congressional organization; (3) Member compensation and allowances; (4) House officers and employees; (5) membership on the Joint Committee of Congress on the Library under the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946; (6) congressional and committee procedure and investigations; (7) the classification of employees; (8) payroll administration; (9) contested elections; (10) the Joint Committee on Congressional Operations; (11) the Congressional Budget Office; (12) Federal Government organization and employees; (13) commerce and trade, foreign relations and intercourse, money and finance, and the postal service; (14) public buildings and related property and public works; (15) public health and welfare; (16) public printing and documents; (17) territories and insular possessions; and (18) miscellaneous uncodified provisions relating to the House. Replaces in many cases functions and duties of: (1) the Committee on House Administration with the Committee on House Oversight; and (2) the Doorkeeper or Sergeant-at-Arms with the Chief Administrative Officer."
