Permits courts to order the forfeiture of substitute assets if the property subject to forfeiture under this Act: (1) cannot be located; (2) has been transferred to a third party; (3) has been placed beyond the jurisdiction of the court; (4) has been substantially diminished in value; or (5) has been commingled with other property. Sets forth: (1) procedures for the seizure of property subject to forfeiture; and (2) procedures and rules for the disposition of forfeited property (first making due provision for the rights of any innocent persons)."
