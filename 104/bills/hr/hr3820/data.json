Sets forth penalties for exceeding contribution limitations. (Sec. 102) Decreases allowable contribution amounts for multicandidate political action committees in Federal elections. Limits political party committee contributions. (Sec. 103) Modifies the limitations on contributions for an opposition candidate when a candidate spends or contributes amounts exceeding personal fund spending limitations. Requires the principal campaign committee of a House candidate to submit certain notifications of expenditures or contributions of such personal funds. (Sec. 105) Prohibits a candidate for Federal office or an individual holding Federal office from establishing or controlling a political committee, other than a principal campaign committee. (Sec. 106) Prohibits bundling of contributions to candidates for Federal office by political action committees and lobbyists. (Sec. 107) Redefines the term \"independent expenditure.\" (Sec. 108) Sets forth requirements for the use of payroll deductions for campaign contributions. Title II: Strengthening Political Parties - Modifies contribution limits with respect to contributions made by an individual to a political party or a political party committee. Limits contributions made by individuals to State political parties. (Sec. 202) Allows political parties to offset funds carried over from previous elections. (Sec. 203) Set forth limitations on the use of funds not subject to the limitations of the Act. (Sec. 204) Permits national and State political party committees (including any subordinate committee of a State committee) to exclude from expenditure limits any amounts expended by the committee for communications with party members. Prohibits such exclusion when the communication expressly advocates the election or defeat of a specific candidate for election to Federal office and other conditions are met. (Sec. 205) Excludes from the definition of \"contribution\" State or local political party committee payments for specified volunteer and grassroots activities. Requires that all State and local party committees allocate their expenses for mixed activities based on a specified ballot composition method. Title III: Disclosure and Enforcement - Modifies political committee reporting requirements, including requiring: (1) certain reports to be made available within 24 hours; (2) making reports available on the Internet; (3) certain reporting by secondary campaign committees; (4) additional post election reporting; and (5) certain information on aggregate contributions.
