    "text": "Voyageurs National Park Revitalization Act of 1995 - Requires the Secretary of the Interior to permit access and use of motorboats, aircraft, hiking, and skiing on all major lakes and bays within Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota, and at least the following interior lakes: (1) Beast; (2) Cruiser; (3) Oslo; (4) Locator; (5) War Club; (6) Quill; (7) Loiten; (8) Shoepack; (9) Little Trout; and (10) Mukooda. Permits use of snowmobiles on and recreational fishing within such major and interior lakes. Requires the Secretary to: (1) study and report to the Congress on the cost of constructing and maintaining additional cross-country ski routes, snowmobile trails, hiking trails, camp sites, and overnight ski huts to allow access to, and use of, the lakes; (2) authorize at least 200 houseboats to operate within the Park; (3) submit to the Congress a management plan for the Park; (4) study and report to the Congress on a comparison of the recreational developments and beneficial economic impacts that were expected to those that occurred following the establishment of the Park. Authorizes appropriations. Repeals Federal law requiring the Secretary to study and report to the President on the suitability or nonsuitability of designating any area within the Park as wilderness."
