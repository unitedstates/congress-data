Lists among such infrastructure assets roads, bridges, electricity supply facilities, airports, water supply and delivery facilities, recycling and wastewater treatment facilities, housing, schools, prisons, and hospitals, as well as other specified facilities. Declares that no State or local government shall be obligated to repay Federal grant monies received in connection with assets being privatized. Authorizes State and local governments to: (1) use asset privatization proceeds as permitted under grant assurances; and (2) recover capital investment, an amount equal to unreimbursed asset operating expenses in any infrastructure asset, and a reasonable rate of return."
