Authorizes the President to rescind all or part of any budget authority if the President determines that such rescission: (1) would help balance the Federal budget, reduce the Federal budget deficit, or reduce the public debt; (2) will not impair any essential Government functions; (3) will not harm the national interest; and (4) will directly contribute to the purpose of this Act of limiting discretionary spending in FY 1996 or 1997. Requires the President to notify the Congress of such a rescission by special message after enactment of appropriations legislation for FY 1996 or 1997. Makes such a rescission effective unless the Congress enacts a rescission disapproval bill. Describes: (1) information to be included in the President's message; and (2) procedures to govern consideration of rescission disapproval legislation in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
