    "text": "American Samoa Economic Development Act of 1995 - Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of the Interior for the Government of American Samoa for FY 1996 through 2005 to be used for: (1) construction, maintenance, and repair of American Samoa's capital assets; (2) operations of the Government of American Samoa; and (3) reduction of unbudgeted debt incurred by the Government of American Samoa in fiscal years prior to 1996. Requires amounts appropriated to be placed in a trust administered by a nongovernmental entity. Prohibits the release of funds for the construction of capital assets for FY 1997 and following years until: (1) the Government of American Samoa submits to the trustee a master plan of capital needs that ranks projects in order of priority for at least five years; and (2) such Government submits to the trustee a maintenance plan covering the anticipated life of the project and the project is initially funded. Approves the release of funds only for construction projects for specified public purposes. Prohibits the release of such funds, beginning in FY 1997, in the areas of communications, electrical power, public health, transportation, water, and wastewater until semiautonomous government agencies of the Government of American Samoa are established by local law. Requires funding provided to reduce the unbudgeted debt and for maintenance or repair of capital assets to be matched by non-Federal sources. Prohibits funds appropriated pursuant to this Act from being transferred to other accounts, loaned to other accounts or agencies, or used as collateral for loans made by the local government. Sets forth conditions on the release of trust funds to be used for construction of capital assets, debt reduction, and maintenance or repair. Requires the Government of American Samoa to obtain and submit an annual audit of its financial position to specified congressional committees. Withholds funds for government operations until a qualifying audit is received and reported. Authorizes the Comptroller General and the Inspector General to conduct audits of all funds of branches and semiautonomous authorities of the Government of American Samoa."
