Directs Federal agencies to work with State agencies to identify areas of extreme fire risk and take action to reduce natural fuels. Authorizes the use of emergency fire suppression funds to reduce natural fuels in such areas, provided that reductions in the Sierra forests are consistent with the fuels management guidelines of the California Spotted Owl EA or subsequent EIS and that fuels reduction activities in roadless areas preserve such area's unique characteristics. Directs the Forest Service to prepare a budget request declaring an emergency in areas identified as requiring additional treatments due to drought or pest infestation on national forest lands. Directs Federal agencies to prepare and submit to the Congress a strategic fire plan and annual budget."
