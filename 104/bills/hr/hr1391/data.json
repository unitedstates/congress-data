Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) conduct a study that compares the health care costs, quality of care, and access to services under Medicare select policies with those under other Medicare supplemental policies; and (2) determine during 1999 whether the amendments made by this Act shall remain in effect beyond such extended period. Declares that such amendments shall remain in effect beyond the extended period unless the Secretary determines, based on the study, that as a result of such amendments: (1) there have been no savings in premium costs to select enrollees as compared to their enrollment in Medicare supplemental policies with comparable coverage which are not Medicare select policies; (2) there have been significant additional expenditures under the Medicare program; or (3) access to and quality of care have been significantly diminished."
