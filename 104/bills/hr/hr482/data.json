Amends SSA title XVI (Supplementary Security Income)(SSI), the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980, and the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to make similar amendments with respect to the receipt of Federal SSI, assisted housing, and food stamp benefits by aliens and, in certain cases, phase-out such benefits entirely."
