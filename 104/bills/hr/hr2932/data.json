Declares that the reprints shall not be regulated as advertising or labeling. Prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from preventing advertising or labeling regarding an approved indication for a new drug, and for any pharmacoeconomic information relating to a drug, unless the Secretary determines in writing that the advertising or labeling is likely to cause unsafe or ineffective misuse."
