Instructs the FAA Administrator to: (1) develop and publish a plan to reduce aircraft-generated noise in New Jersey by six decibels for at least 80 percent of the people residing within 18 nautical miles of Newark International Airport; (2) investigate and test southbound departure procedures from Newark International Airport runway 22 that will result in a minimum 25 percent decrease in aircraft noise on the ground in northwestern Staten Island; (3) investigate a straight-out southbound departure from runway 22; and (4) undertake remediation efforts to mitigate aircraft noise within a specified sound level contour. Confers standing in Federal district court upon the New Jersey Citizens for Environmental Research (and a group to be designated by the Staten Island Borough President) to compel the Administrator to comply with this Act. Sets deadlines for FAA implementation of this Act."
