    "text": "Deep Water Outfall Treatment Systems Act of 1996 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to authorize an eligible State to initiate, expand, or continue a study of the marine environment of coastal areas to determine the feasibility of constructing a deep water outfall for any publicly owned treatment work (POTW) that uses primary treatments and is not exempt from specified effluent limitations. Provides that such study may recommend one or more technically feasible locations for a deep water outfall that would have beneficial effects on the marine environment. Sets forth provisions regarding applications for: (1) modification of secondary treatment requirements for certain POTWs by the owner in an eligible State at a location recommended in such a study; and (2) initial and final determinations regarding and effective periods of such modifications. Specifies that such requirements shall not apply to the POTW owner or operator in an eligible State that has submitted an application for a modification during the period beginning on the date of submission of the application and ending on the date of a final determination."
