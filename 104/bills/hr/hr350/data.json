Prohibits any U.S. justice or judge who is in regular active service or who has retired and is receiving the salary of the office and who has been convicted of a State or Federal felony from receiving his or her salary beginning on the date of the conviction. Reinstates and provides reimbursement for such salary if the conviction is subsequently overturned or reversed."
