Requires the OIRA Director to establish an Interagency Council on Statistical Policy. Requires each Federal agency to: (1) establish a process, independent of program responsibility, to evaluate proposed collections of information; and (2) ensure that the public has timely, equal, and equitable access to information products and services. Prohibits agencies, except where specifically authorized by statute, from: (1) establishing exclusive, restricted, or other distribution arrangements that interfere with timely and equitable public availability; (2) restricting or regulating the use, resale, or redissemination of public information by the public; (3) charging fees or royalties for resale or redissemination of public information; or (4) establishing user fees that exceed the cost of dissemination. Specifies actions agencies must take with respect to information technology. Replaces the Federal Information Locator System with an agency-based electronic Government Information Locator Service to identify the major information systems, holdings, and dissemination products of each agency. Reauthorizes appropriations for OIRA."
