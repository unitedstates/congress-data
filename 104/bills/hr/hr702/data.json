Directs the Secretary of Labor to use amounts appropriated from the Fund for: (1) job retraining assistance under the Job Training Partnership Act; and (2) job creation activities under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965. Appropriates to the Fund all cost savings realized by the Secretary under this Act. Provides for Fund management. Requires an annual report from the Secretary of the Treasury to the Congress on the financial condition and operations of the Fund during the preceding fiscal year and those expected for the next five fiscal years."
