Allows the Secretary, subject to the availability of appropriations, to make funds available to facilitate the participation of individuals from the private sector on such Boards to ensure public input into the designation of such areas or Refuges. Requires the Board to: (1) monitor and periodically report to the Secretary on progress made in the conservation and recovery of species for which the critical habitat or Refuge was designated; and (2) periodically review and report to the Secretary regarding the continued accuracy and sufficiency of the scientific findings that were the basis of such designation."
