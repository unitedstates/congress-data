Prohibits any Federal agency from expending Federal funds for the development or dissemination of model or national content standards, national student performance standards, or national opportunity-to-learn standards. Eliminates the requirement that the National Education Goals Panel review and approve such standards and criteria. Terminates funding for: (1) the Council; (2) opportunity-to-learn development grants; and (3) assessment development and evaluation grants. Makes technical and conforming amendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the General Education Provisions Act, and the Education Amendments of 1978."
