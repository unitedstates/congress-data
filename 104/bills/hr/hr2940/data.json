    "text": "Deepwater Port Modernization Act - Amends the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 to revise the term \"deepwater port\" to include a fixed or floating manmade structure (other than a vessel) located beyond the territorial sea and off the U.S. coast which is used as a port or terminal for the transportation of oil from the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf. Eliminates: (1) certain utilization and transfer restrictions on deepwater ports; and (2) a certain antitrust precondition with respect to the licensing of such ports. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to exempt an applicant for a deepwater port license from certain informational filing requirements, provided such exemption will not limit public review of the deepwater port project. Repeals the restriction on the issuance of a deepwater port license requiring that the Secretary first receive opinions from the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission as to whether such action would adversely affect competition, restrain trade, promote monopolization, or otherwise contravene the antitrust laws. Requires a deepwater port, among other things, to accept, transport, or convey without discrimination all oil delivered to it. Directs the Secretary to prescribe and enforce procedures with respect to the environment and navigational safety as they relate to deepwater ports either by regulation (for basic standards and conditions), or by the licensee's operations manual."
