Requires: (1) the terms of the transfer to include a commitment by the District to continue to use and operate the facility for the existing purposes following the transfer; and (2) the District to comply with all applicable laws or regulations governing changes in operations or uses. Declares that such sale and water rights conveyance are consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 without additional environmental review and, consequently, no new environmental documentation is required. Requires the District to continue to make payments into the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund for 35 years after enactment of this Act. Exempts the District from the Reclamation Act of 1902 upon conveyance of the Unit."
