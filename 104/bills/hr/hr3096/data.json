Requires a professional sports league to make instant replay available to the head referee or the designate. Vests power in the Federal Trade Commission: (1) to examine and investigate a professional sports league to determine whether such league has been or is engaged in any act or practice prohibited by this Act; and (2) if the league is found to be in violation, to take action against it by the issuance of a cease and desist order as if the league were in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act."
