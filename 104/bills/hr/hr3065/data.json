Allows the indications for which a radiopharmaceutical intended for diagnostic purposes is approved to refer to processes, processes common to or present in one or more disease states, or a diagnostic procedure used in the diagnosis of one or more diseases. Requires that, if a radiopharmaceutical is the primary mode of action in a combination of drugs, the persons charged with premarket review of radiopharmaceutical products have primary regulatory jurisdiction."
