    "text": "Neighborhood Infrastructure Improvement and Inner City Job Creation Act - Directs the Secretary of Labor to make grants to eligible administrative entities for programs to provide employment opportunities to unemployed individuals through payments for labor and related costs associated with repair and renovation of essential community facilities. Makes an area eligible for such a program if it has a poverty rate above 30 percent and is: (1) a local government with a population of 50,000 or more; or (2) a Native American Indian tribe, band or group located on a Federal or State reservation, the Oklahoma Indians, and any Alaska Native village or group, having a governing body. Gives grant priority to administrative entities that assure giving priority to low-skilled workers as program participants. Requires eligible participants to have been unemployed for at least 15 weeks and have sought employment during that period. Makes secondary school-age individuals (16 to 20 years old) eligible only if they have not attended a secondary school at any time during the previous six months. Gives priority to individuals who have exhausted or are not eligible for unemployment insurance benefits, particularly those who have been unemployed for the longest periods. Authorizes appropriations."
