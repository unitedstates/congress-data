    "text": "Veterans' Training and Employment Bill of Rights Act of 1996 - Entitles the following covered persons to priority of services under any federally-funded workforce preparation, development, or delivery program or service, as long as such person otherwise meets participation eligibility requirements: (1) veterans who have a service-connected disability or who served on active duty in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized; (2) the spouse of any person who died of a service-connected disability or who has a total permanent disability resulting from a service-connected disability; (3) the spouse of any member serving on active duty who is listed as missing in action, captured in the line of duty by a hostile force, or forcibly detained or interned by a foreign government or power; and (4) the spouse of a veteran who died while a permanent service-connected disability was in existence. Requires State and local entities performing such programs or services to inform covered individuals of the availability of such services. Directs the Secretary of Labor to report annually to the congressional veterans' committees concerning an evaluation of such priority program and its level of services. (Sec. 3) Requires Federal contracts or grants of $100,000 or more for the procurement of personal property and non-personal services to contain a provision under which the party receiving the contract or grant agrees to take affirmative action to employ and advance qualified veterans who: (1) are disabled; (2) served on active duty in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized; or (3) while serving on active duty, participated in a U.S. military operation for which an armed forces service medal was awarded. Directs the President to implement promulgating regulations which require the contractee or grantee to list employment openings with local employment agencies and to give priority to qualifying veterans. (Sec. 4) Requires veterans qualifying under this Act to be given appropriate recruitment (currently, readjustment) appointments within the Federal Government. (Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary to provide specified veterans' employment rights and benefits assistance to veterans qualifying under this Act. Provides for the filing, investigation, and determination of claims by qualifying individuals that an entity has failed to comply with the hiring requirements provided under this Act. (Sec. 6) Authorizes the Secretary to allocate an additional ten full-time equivalent positions from the Employment and Training Administration of the Department of Labor to the Veterans' Employment and Training Service to carry out work training and employment services for qualifying individuals."
