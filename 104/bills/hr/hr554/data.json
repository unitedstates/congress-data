    "text": "Stop Turning Out Prisoners Act - Revises provisions of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 regarding judicial remedies with respect to prison conditions. Specifies that prospective relief in a civil action with respect to prison conditions shall extend no further than necessary to remove the conditions that are causing the deprivation of the Federal rights of individual plaintiffs in that action. Prohibits the court from granting or approving any prospective relief unless it finds that the relief is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to remedy the violation of the Federal right. Directs the court, in determining the intrusiveness of the relief, to give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the relief. Prohibits the court, in any such action, from granting or approving any relief whose purpose or effect is to reduce or limit the prison population unless the plaintiff proves that crowding is the primary cause of the deprivation of the Federal right and no other relief will remedy that deprivation. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) termination of relief (including provision for the automatic termination of prospective relief after a two-year period); (2) procedure for motions affecting prospective relief; (3) standing (grants standing to specified Federal, State, or local officials to oppose the imposition or continuation in effect of relief the purpose or effect of which is to reduce or limit the prison population and to intervene in any proceeding relating to that relief); (4) special masters; and (5) attorney's fees."
