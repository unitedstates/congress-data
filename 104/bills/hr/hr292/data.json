Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish on such basis recommended adequate inventory levels for home heating fuel, natural gas, and automotive fuel. Requires the Secretary to: (1) notify the Congress, the President, and State energy offices before October 1 of each year whether such inventory levels will be met for the winter heating season; and (2) recommend legislative and administrative actions necessary to restore inadequate inventories if they fall below recommended levels. Requires the Secretary to study and report on the effect of interruptible natural gas contracts on the demand and supply of home heating fuel during the 1989-1990 winter heating season."
