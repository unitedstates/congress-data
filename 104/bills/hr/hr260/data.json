Provides that the Plan shall be deemed approved unless the Congress enacts a joint resolution modifying or rejecting it within 180 days. Directs the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register and transmit to the Committees, within 45 days after transmittal of the Plan, the proposed and final criteria to be used by the Department of the Interior in reviewing existing System units. Provides that such criteria shall be the final criteria to be used unless disapproved by a joint resolution of the Congress enacted within 30 legislative days after its receipt. Allows the Secretary to amend such criteria but prohibits the amendments from becoming effective until they have been published in the Federal Register, opened to public comment for at least 30 days, and transmitted to such Committees in final form. Requires the Secretary to: (1) review the existing System to determine whether any units do not conform to the Plan and, if so, to determine whether there are more appropriate alternatives for managing them; and (2) develop a report that contains a list of units where National Park Service management should be modified or terminated (which may not include any area Congress has designated as a national park). Establishes a National Park System Review Commission: (1) to review such report or to develop it if the Secretary fails to develop and transmit it; and (2) within two years after its establishment, to transmit to the Committees a report recommending System units where NPS management should be terminated or modified. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed as modifying or terminating any System unit without a subsequent Act of the Congress. Prohibits this limitation from limiting any existing authority of the Secretary. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Secretary to report on the procedures that have been instituted to report to the U.S. Attorney or other appropriate law enforcement officials any intimidation, threats, or acts of violence against Service employees related to their duties. Title II: New Area Establishment - Removes certain reporting requirements concerning additional areas for the National Park System. Directs the Secretary to submit to the Committees an annual list of areas recommended for study for potential inclusion in the System. Bars the initiation of any study of the potential of an area for inclusion in the System after this Act's enactment, except by specific authorization by an Act of the Congress. Requires studies to be completed within three fiscal years of the enactment date of legislation providing for a study. Specifies factors to be considered in such studies and requires such studies to be completed in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a single office to prepare all new area studies and to implement other functions of this title; and (2) submit with the annual budget submission a list of areas which have been studied previously which contain primarily historical resources and areas which contain primarily natural resources in numerical order of priority for addition to the System."
