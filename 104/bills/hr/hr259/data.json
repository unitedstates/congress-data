    "text": "Amends Federal transportation law to repeal specified authorities with respect to the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (AMTRAK), eliminating intercity rail passenger transportation (while retaining AMTRAK commuter services). (Sec. 3) Repeals a provision which provides for the judicial review of the discontinuance of a route, a train, or transportation, or the reduction in the frequency of transportation by AMTRAK. (Sec. 4) Authorizes appropriations in decreasing amounts over four fiscal years. (Sec. 5) Repeals specified laws that apply to AMTRAK operations, abolishing the Board of Directors. Declares that the United States relinquishes all rights held in any stock, note of indebtedness, or mortgage issued by or entered into with AMTRAK. (Sec. 6) Repeals: (1) certain provisions which require AMTRAK to make an agreement to avoid duplicating employee functions; (2) all authority for operation of the AMTRAK route system; and (3) all authority for the Northeast Corridor improvement program. (Sec. 8) Prohibits a rail carrier employee whose employment is terminated as a result of a discontinuance of intercity rail passenger service from receiving any wage continuation or severance benefit in excess of six months pay. Authorizes a rail carrier to require an employee whose position is eliminated as a result of such discontinuance to transfer to any vacant position for which he or she can be made qualified on any part of the rail carrier's system. (Sec. 9) Amends the Federal Employers' Liability Act (or Employers' Liability Act) to declare that it shall not apply to common carriers to the extent they provide rail passenger transportation."
