Directs the Commission to submit a report to the Congress concerning offenses involving child pornography and other sex offenses against children, including: (1) an analysis of the sentences imposed for specified sex offenses and recommendations as to any modifications to the sentencing guidelines; (2) an analysis (and recommendations regarding modification) of the sentences for other specified offenses where the victim was under age 18; (3) an analysis of the type of substantial assistance that courts have recognized as warranting a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines for specified child pornography offenses; and (4) a survey of the recidivism rate for offenders convicted of committing sexual crimes against children, an analysis of the impact on recidivism of sexual abuse treatment provided during or after incarceration, and an analysis of whether increased penalties would reduce recidivism for those crimes."
