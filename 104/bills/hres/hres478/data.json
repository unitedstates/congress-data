Provides an exception for the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Requires the Clerk of the House of Representatives to: (1) establish a central electronic data base of official documents to which committees may have access; (2) establish universal data elements respecting such official documents; and (3) implement standards established by the Committee on House Oversight with respect to the content of such data bases. Directs the Committee to establish standards to provide guidance to the Clerk and committees respecting electronic data bases which may be accessed by committees to effectuate the electronic document reform necessary to enable committees to carry out amendments to the Rules of the House pursuant to this Act. Encourages the Committee to develop such standards in consultation with the Senate so that identical standards can be implemented in both Chambers."
