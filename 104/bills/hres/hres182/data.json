Prohibits the reductions in suballocations from being reallocated by the Committee on Appropriations to any other subcommittee. Requires, upon the reporting of revised suballocations to the House by the Committee on Appropriations, the chairman of the Committee on the Budget to: (1) make appropriate revisions in the allocations to the Committee on Appropriations to reflect the revised suballocations; and (2) report those revisions to the House. Deems, in the House, such revised suballocations and revised allocations as suballocations and allocations made under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974."
