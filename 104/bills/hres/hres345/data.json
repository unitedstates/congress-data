Supports efforts by the United States to provide assistance to Cambodia to broaden democratic civil society, to strengthen the rule of law, and to ensure that future elections in Cambodia are free and fair. Calls for the United States to raise human rights concerns at the June 1996 Donor's Consultative Meeting for Cambodia and during consideration of projects in Cambodia to be financed by international financial institutions."
