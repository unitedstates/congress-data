    "text": "Amends the Rules of the House of Representatives to require each standing committee (other than the Appropriations and Budget Committees) to either establish oversight committees or designate at least three staff members to be solely responsible for oversight. Directs the Committee on House Oversight to: (1) modify its committee funding policies to allow committees to use General Accounting Office and executive branch detailees; and (2) develop an electronic program such that Members may track and categorize their casework requests and report their findings to a central House unit. Expresses the sense of the House that: (1) the Oversight Committee should provide committees with sufficient investigative resources; (2) the General Counsel should provide more timely, proactive, and strategic advice to committees respecting the issuance of subpoenas and the lack of compliance by officials; and (3) committees should better utilize the Corrections Day process. (Sec. 2) Directs the Committee to make resources available to the Chief Administrative Officer to perform management and technology audits of committees. (Sec. 3) Directs the Parliamentarian to: (1) establish a comprehensive program to train selected committee staff to serve as parliamentary advisors; and (2) commence to recodify the Rules at the beginning of the 105th Congress. (Sec. 5) Allows Members to participate in committee hearings through audiovisual contact under specified circumstances. Authorizes each committee to not apply the five-minute rule in the interrogation of witnesses in a hearing to the extent that the rules of that committee so permit. Expresses the sense of the House encouraging committees to utilize alternative hearing formats. (Sec. 6) Provides that no point of order shall lie against any committee report for failing to comply with certain voting requirements on reporting measures if the report is in substantial compliance. Repeals a requirement regarding inflationary impact statements. Directs that specified reports contain a statement of performance goals. Provides that if two or more committees jointly study or investigate any matter, such committees may file a joint report. (Sec. 7) Limits the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight to six, and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to five, subcommittees. Repeals: (1) an exception for the Appropriations Committee from the requirement that whenever any entity is to be granted authorization for the payment of its expenses, such authorization initially shall be procured by one primary expense resolution reported by the Oversight Committee; and (2) a limitation on committees' sittings during the five-minute rule. Expresses the sense of the House that the respective party caucus and conference should enforce subcommittee assignment limits. (Sec. 8) Requires the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to determine whether any complaint against a Member, officer, or employee of the House is properly filed and, if so, whether a preliminary investigation is warranted. Sets forth: (1) further requirements regarding preliminary investigations and limits on participation on the Committee or an investigative panel; and (2) provisions regarding the handling of frivolous complaints."
