Provides that Vietnamese asylum seekers: (1) who, on appeal to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, have been designated as refugees should be protected from repatriation and interviewed for resettlement in the United States; (2) in the refugee camps in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand who have a relationship with the United States and those who apparently quality as refugees under specified criteria should be given access to U.S. immigration officials for resettlement interviews; (3) who are accepted for resettlement in the United States should be admitted under the FY 1997 immigration ceiling for Vietnamese nationals; (4) previously repatriated to Vietnam who have volunteered for the Program should be immediately interviewed for resettlement in the United States under such criteria; and (5) repatriated to Vietnam before having an opportunity to sign up for the Program should be provided with the regulations and application forms for the Program."
