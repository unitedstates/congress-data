Provides that the defendant shall be subject to the death penalty if death results from the violent felony. (Sec. 102) Provides that any individual who is convicted of a Federal or State crime of violence shall, at the discretion of the court, be ineligible for any or all Federal benefits for up to five years upon a first conviction, up to ten years upon a second conviction, and permanently upon a third conviction. (Sec. 103) Amends the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 to eliminate judicial discretion in the denial of Federal benefits in cases of certain drug offenses. (Sec. 104) Provides for an enhanced penalty for the discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime. (Sec. 105) Amends the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to provide for mandatory minimum prison sentences for those who sell illegal drugs to minors or who use minors in drug trafficking activities. (Sec. 106) Amends the Federal criminal code to require: (1) the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to establish a program of drug testing of criminal defendants on post-conviction release; and (2) the chief probation officer in each district to arrange for the drug testing of such defendants. Requires, as an explicit condition of probation, parole, or supervised release for a felony or a specified violent or drug offense, that the defendant refrain from any unlawful use of a controlled substance and submit to periodic drug tests. (Sec. 107) Amends the Armed Career Criminal Act to include within the definition of \"serious drug offense\" an offense under State law which, if it had been prosecuted as a CSA violation at the time of the offense and because of the type and quantity of the controlled substance involved, would have been punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more. (Sec. 108) Sets mandatory penalties for firearms possession by persons previously convicted of a violent felony or a serious drug offense, and a mandatory minimum sentence for unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, fugitive from justice, or transferor or receiver of a stolen firearm. (Sec. 110) Increases: (1) the general penalty for violation of Federal firearms laws; and (2) enhanced penalties for possession of a firearm in connection with a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime. (Sec. 112) Sets penalties for smuggling firearms in aid of drug trafficking or violent crime. (Sec. 116) Establishes: (1) a temporary prohibition against possession of a firearm by, or transfer of a firearm to, persons convicted of a drug crime; and (2) enhanced penalties for possession of a firearm during a drug crime. Subtitle B: Capital Offenses - Amends the Federal criminal code to establish criteria for imposition of the death penalty for Federal crimes. Requires: (1) the Government, for any offense punishable by death, to serve notice upon the defendant that it intends to seek the death penalty and the aggravating factors upon which it will rely; and (2) the court to conduct a separate sentencing hearing before a jury, or the court along upon motion by the defendant with the approval of the attorney for the Government, when the defendant is found guilty or pleads guilty to an offense punishable by death and the attorney for the Government has met the notice requirements. Allows the defendant and the Government to present any information relevant to sentencing, but permits evidence to be excluded where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury. Permits the Government to present information concerning the effect of the offense on the victim and the victim's family. Specifies mitigating and aggravating factors. Sets forth special aggravating factors for: (1) treason, espionage, homicide, and the attempted murder of the President; and (2) drug offenses punishable by the death penalty (such factors include previous serious drug felony convictions, use of a firearm in committing or furthering certain continuing criminal enterprises, use of minors in trafficking, and lethal adulteration of controlled substances). States that no person who was under age 18 at the time of the offense may be sentenced to death. Requires the court to instruct the jury not to be influenced by prejudice or bias relating to the race, color, religion, national origin, or sex of the defendant or any victim in considering whether to recommend a sentence of death. Sets forth procedures regarding imposition of, appeal from, and implementation of, a sentence of death. Prohibits: (1) a sentence of death from being carried out upon a person who lacks the mental capacity to understand the death penalty and why it was imposed on that person, or upon a woman while she is pregnant; and (2) requiring any employee of a State department of corrections, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Marshals Service, or any person providing services to that department, bureau, or service under contract to be in attendance or to participate in any execution if such participation is contrary to such person's moral or religious convictions. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) appointment of counsel; (2) deadlines for collateral attacks on judgments imposing a sentence of death; and (3) stays of execution. Limits the circumstances under which a person subject to the criminal jurisdiction of an Indian tribal government may be executed under this subtitle. (Sec. 122) Declares that the death penalty and all other penalties shall be administered by the United States and by every State without regard to the race or color of the defendant or victim, and that neither the United States nor any State shall prescribe any racial quota or statistical test for the imposition or execution of the death penalty or any other penalty. (Sec. 123) Specifies that, in a prosecution for an offense against the United States for which a sentence of death is authorized, the fact that the killing of the victim was motivated by racial prejudice or bias shall be deemed an aggravating factor whose existence permits consideration of the death penalty, in addition to any other aggravating factors that may be specified by law as permitting consideration of the death penalty. (Sec. 124) Extends the protection of civil rights provisions regarding conspiracy against rights and deprivation of rights under color of law to cover persons in (currently, limited to inhabitants of) any State, territory, or district.
