Tolls such period while the petitioner pursues State post-conviction remedies, unless the petitioner fails to initiate post-conviction review within 270 days in capital cases or 180 days in non-capital cases. Provides for a one-time 60-day extension of the period upon a showing of good cause.

Requires State to have at least 80 percent currency of crime cases in their systems within three years. Directs the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to begin a study of child abusers' criminal records. (Sec. 806) Amends the Omnibus Act to provide for the use of drug control and system improvement grants for the improvement of State record systems and the sharing of records of child abuse crime information to implement this subtitle. Subtitle C: Crimes Against Children Registration - Directs the Attorney General to establish guidelines for State programs requiring any person convicted of a criminal offense against a victim who is a minor to register a current address with a designated State LEA for ten yeas after release from prison, or being placed on parole or supervised release. Subjects to criminal penalties a person required to register under a State program who knowingly fails to register and keep such registration current. (Sec. 808) Specifies that the allocation of BJA grant funds (under the Omnibus Act) received by a State not complying with provisions of this Act three years after its enactment shall be reduced by ten percent, with the unallocated funds to be reallocated to the States in compliance with this Act.
