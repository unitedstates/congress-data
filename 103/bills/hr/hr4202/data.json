(Sec. 102) Requires such a plan to provide for all medically necessary acute medical care (including physician services; inpatient, outpatient, and emergency hospital services and appropriate alternatives to hospitalization; and inpatient and outpatient prescription drugs), to not exclude coverage for selected illnesses or selected treatments if consistent with medically accepted practices, and to meet applicable cost-sharing requirements of this Act. Requires that such plan, in the case of a high deductible umbrella insurance plan, provide a deductible amount for benefits provided in any plan year which is at least $1,500 (but not to exceed $3,000) for items and services furnished to a family (composed of one or more individuals) enrolled under the plan in a year. Specifies that a health insurance plan may not require the payment of any copayment or coinsurance for an item or service for which coverage is required after an individual or a family has incurred out-of-pocket expenses equal to a specified limit for a plan year. (Sec. 103) Requires that such a plan provide: (1) for a variation in premium rates only on the basis of age, sex, geography, and family enrollment, individual and group coverage, and in the case of group coverage, on the basis of the number of individuals covered within the group; (2) for a charge of the same premium rates to new applicants and existing policyholders with the same age, sex, geographic characteristics, and family enrollment; and (3) that the highest premium for the plan for a particular class of family enrollment and geographic characteristics may not exceed four times the lowest premium for such plan for the same enrollment and geographic characteristics. Permits incentive discounts of not more than ten percent for participating in an approved program to promote healthy behavior, prevent or delay the onset of illness, or provide for screening or early detection of illness. (Sec. 104) Requires that such plan: (1) provide guaranteed issue at standard rates to all applicants; and (2) not exclude from coverage, or limit coverage for, any preexisting condition, with exceptions. (Sec. 105) Requires that such plan provide the policyholder with a contractual right to renew the coverage which stipulates that the insurer cannot cancel or refuse to renew the coverage except for cases of nonpayment of premiums, or fraud or misrepresentation, by the policyholder. (Sec. 106) Sets forth restrictions on agent compensation and broker activities. Part 2: Certification of High Deductible Umbrella Insurance Plans and Managed Care Health Plans - Requires each State to submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services a report on steps the State is taking to implement and enforce a regulatory program with respect to high deductible umbrella insurance plans and managed care health plans by a specified deadline. Directs the Secretary, upon determining that a State has failed to submit a report by the deadline or that the State has not implemented and provided adequate enforcement of the regulatory program, to give the State 60 days to submit such report or implement and enforce such program. Sets forth procedures for Federal enforcement if such failure has not been corrected. (Sec. 112) Directs the Secretary to develop State regulatory program standards, in the form of model Acts and model regulations, which include: (1) procedures for certifying that the requirements of part 1 of this subtitle have been met by a health insurance plan applying for certification as a high deductible umbrella insurance plan or a managed care health plan; (2) specified requirements regarding marketing practices and reinsurance or allocation of risk mechanisms with respect to such a plan; (3) requirements regarding solvency standards and guaranty funds for carriers of such plans; and (4) reporting requirements under which carriers report to the Internal Revenue Service regarding the acquisition and termination by individuals of coverage under such plans. Directs the Secretary to: (1) request the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to develop models for reinsurance or allocation of risk mechanisms for high deductible umbrella insurance plans and managed care health plans made available to individuals for whom an insurer is at risk of incurring high costs under the plan; and (2) review such models to determine if they provide for an effective reinsurance or allocation of risk mechanism. Requires each State to establish one or more reinsurance or allocation of risk mechanisms consistent with such a model. Permits a State to establish and maintain such a mechanism jointly with other States. Directs the Secretary to establish and maintain a reinsurance or allocation of risk mechanism if a State has failed to establish or maintain such a mechanism. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a tax on the providing of any high deductible umbrella insurance plan or managed care health plan which covers any individual in a Federal reinsurance State. Directs that the tax imposed equal the applicable percentage of the amount received by the insurer for providing such plan in such Federal reinsurance State. Makes the insurer liable for payment of the tax. Subtitle B: Promoting Development of Voluntary Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives - Directs the Secretary to establish standards relating to the establishment of health plan purchasing cooperatives (HPPCs), qualifications for qualified health carriers, and the roles of States under this subtitle. Sets forth provisions regarding deadlines, revision of standards, application of standards through States, the Federal role, and implementation of the standards. (Sec. 122) Requires each State to establish boundaries for HPPC areas in the State. (Sec. 123) Authorizes the establishment of one or more State-chartered, nonprofit private corporations to serve as an HPPC for each HPPC area for the benefit of small employers and eligible individuals in the area. Specifies that a carrier may not form, underwrite, or possess a majority vote of an HPPC, but may administer an HPPC. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the establishment by each HPPC of bylaws; (2) the election of members of its board of directors; (3) limitation of liability for good faith actions taken by any member of the board, its employees, or agent in the performance of duties of HPPCs; (4) appointment of officers and an executive director; (5) reporting, recordkeeping, and audit requirements; and (6) general authorities and limits on the authority of HPPCs. (Sec. 124) Requires each HPPC to: (1) enter into contracts and hold policies with qualified health carriers which elect to offer HPPC plans to members; (2) provide for the enrollment of eligible employees of small employers and eligible individuals in HPPC plans of qualified health carriers offered by the HPPC; (3) provide to its members and eligible employees of small employer members comparison sheets with clear standardized information on each qualified health carrier and each HPPC plan offered by a qualified health carrier; (4) establish requirements for participation of small employers and eligible individuals as HPPC members consistent with any standards established by the Secretary and to maintain eligibility records; and (5) establish dispute resolution procedures to resolve disputes between the HPPC and its members or qualified health carriers.
