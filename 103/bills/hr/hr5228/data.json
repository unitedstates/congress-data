(Sec. 1001) Exempts federally qualified health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and HMOs or managed care organizations recognized by State laws from the requirement to provide high-deductible coverage. Prohibits the offer of high-deductible coverage unless the carrier also makes standard coverage available with identical benefits and the individual or employee demonstrates that they have available assets equal to at least the deductible amount under the high-deductible coverage. Requires carriers to provide for coverage of benefits for items and services furnished throughout the fair rating area. Prohibits carriers from limiting coverage to portions of interstate metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), requiring them to provide coverage throughout the entire MSA.

Permits carriers to deny coverage if they do not have the necessary financial reserves.

Incorporates such model into a rule that specifies risk adjustment mechanisms. Requires each State to develop systems that conform with the Federal model.
