Allows the defendant and the Government to present any information relevant to sentencing, but permits evidence to be excluded where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury. Sets forth: (1) mitigating and aggravating factors; and (2) special aggravating factors for espionage, treason, homicide, attempted murder of the President, and drug offenses punishable by the death penalty (including previous serious drug felony convictions, use of a firearm in committing or furthering certain continuing criminal enterprises, use of minors in trafficking, and lethal adulteration of controlled substances).

Title III: Exclusionary Rule - States that the Constitution does not require the exclusion from a criminal trial of evidence: (1) obtained in reasonable reliance on a search warrant issued by a detached and neutral magistrate who is not misled, even though the warrant is ultimately determined to be invalid; (2) the legal discovery of which was inevitable, even though the evidence was in fact discovered through constitutionally invalid means; or (3) for which a source exists that is independent of the source through which the evidence was in fact discovered through constitutionally invalid means. Title IV: Firearms - Subtitle A: Firearms and Related Amendments - Amends the Federal criminal code to provide for enhanced penalties for: (1) the use of a semiautomatic firearm during a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense, with exceptions; and (2) possession of a firearm or explosive during the commission of such offenses.

(Sec. 804) Requires: (1) the judge in a Federal capital case before a jury to instruct the jury not to be influenced by prejudice or bias relating to the race or color of the defendant or victim in considering whether a sentence of death is justified; and (2) the jury, upon the return of a recommendation of a sentence of death, to return a certificate, signed by each juror, that the juror's individual decision was not affected by prejudice or bias relating to the race or color of the defendant or victim and that the individual juror would have made the same recommendation regardless of the race or color of the defendant or victim. Makes the fact that the killing of a victim was motivated by racial prejudice or bias an aggravating factor whose existence permits consideration of the death penalty, in a prosecution for an offense against the United States for which a sentence of death is authorized.

(Sec. 805) Amends: (1) the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize drug control and system improvement grants to States to provide in all appropriate cases, particularly in collateral and other post-conviction proceedings, adequate resources and expertise to ensure that the death penalty is expeditiously carried out; and (2) specified civil rights provisions to cover conspiracy against rights, and deprivation of rights under color of law, of any person (currently, inhabitant of) a State, territory, or district. Title IX: Victims' Rights - Authorizes the court: (1) to require the defendant to reimburse the victim for necessary child care, transportation, and other expenses related to participation in the investigation or prosecution of, or attendance or proceedings related to, the offense; and (2) if the defendant is delinquent in making restitution pursuant to an established payment schedule, after a hearing, to suspend the defendant's eligibility for all Federal benefits until such time as the defendant demonstrates to the court good-faith efforts to return to such schedule. (Sec. 902) Amends the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to authorize the court: (1) before imposing sentence for a crime of violence or sexual abuse, to address the victim personally if the victim is present at the sentencing hearing and determine if the victim wishes to make a statement and present any information in relation to the sentence; and (2) upon a motion that is filed jointly by the defendant and the attorney for the Government, to hear in camera such a statement by the victim."
