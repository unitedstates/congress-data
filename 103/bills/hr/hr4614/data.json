Requires the Administrator, in awarding such grants, to give priority consideration to projects that provide for the transfer of technologies to other areas of the United States. Sets the maximum Federal share of project costs at: (1) 100 percent of the cost of a feasibility study; (2) 80 percent of the cost of engineering and design; and (3) 80 percent of the cost of construction. Authorizes appropriations."
