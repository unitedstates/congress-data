Makes any U.S. vessel eligible to receive such a license unless the vessel was previously authorized to be used for fishing on the high seas by a foreign nation and such nation suspended or, within the last three years preceding application for a license, withdrew such authorization because the vessel undermined the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures. (Sec. 104) Makes such restriction inapplicable in cases where the Secretary of Commerce determines that issuing a license would not subvert the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas. Sets forth application and fee provisions. (Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary to maintain a record of high seas fishing vessels issued licenses under this Act and to notify the flag State if a foreign fishing vessel has engaged in activities undermining the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures. (Sec. 106) Sets forth enforcement and penalty provisions. Title II: Implementation of Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries - Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Convention Act of 1994 - Provides for the implementation of the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries, including regarding: (1) appointment of U.S. representatives and alternate representatives as Commissioners and on the Scientific Council; (2) handling of requests for scientific advice; (3) the authorities of the Secretary of State; and (4) cooperation between various agencies, private institutions, and organizations. (Sec. 207) Makes certain actions unlawful, including: (1) violating any regulation issued under this Act or any measure legally binding on the United States under the Convention; (2) resisting, impeding, intimidating, or interfering with certain actions; and (3) transporting, selling, or possessing fish taken in violation of these provisions. Provides for: (1) civil and criminal penalties, permit sanctions, and forfeiture of vessels, cargo, and fish; (2) enforcement by the Coast Guard; and (3) U.S. district court exclusive jurisdiction. (Sec. 208) Directs the Secretaries of State and Commerce to jointly establish a consultative committee on issues related to the Convention and the agreement with Canada. (Sec. 211) Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Governing International Fishery Agreement - Approves the governing international fishery agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the government of the Republic of Lithuania. Title IV: Atlantic Tunas Convention Act - Atlantic Tunas Convention Authorization Act of 1994 - Amends the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975 (the Act) to mandate a comprehensive research program to support the conservation and management of Atlantic bluefin tuna and other highly migratory species, including identifying and defining the range of stocks. Amends Federal law to remove a provision authorizing appropriations for a currently-mandated biennial report on bluefin tuna. (Sec. 403) Regulates operational matters for the advisory committee established by the Act, including regarding quorums, a chairman, meetings, and administrative and technical support. (Sec. 404) Prohibits the promulgation of regulations to increase or decrease fishery mortality levels. (Sec. 405) Makes the civil penalty and permit sanctions of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act applicable to violations of this Act. (Sec. 406) Authorizes appropriations to carry out the Act. (Sec. 407) Directs the Secretary of Commerce to submit a report annually to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries that: (1) details for the previous ten-year period the catches and exports to the United States of highly migratory species from nations fishing on Atlantic stocks that are subject to management by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas; (2) identifies those fishing nations whose harvests are inconsistent with the conservation and management recommendations of the Commission; (3) describes reporting requirements to ensure that imported fish are in compliance with international management measures; and (4) describes actions taken to certify to the President if vessels of any nation are harvesting fish in a manner which would tend to diminish the effectiveness of the recommendations of the Commission. (Sec. 408) Declares the sense of the Congress regarding measures to be taken to promote the conservation and management of Atlantic bluefin tuna throughout the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Title V: Fishermen's Protective Act - Amends the Fisherman's Protective Act of 1967 to direct the Secretary of State to reimburse vessel owners for fees paid to a foreign government to navigate in its waters if such a fee is regarded by the United States as being inconsistent with international law. (Sec. 502) Directs the President, if a nation imposes conditions on the operation or transit of U.S. fishing vessels that are inconsistent with international law or agreement, to impose similar conditions on the vessels of that nation. (Sec. 503) Repeals the statutory formula used to fix the related fees collected by the Secretary of State. Extends the termination date of the Fisherman's Protective Act from October 1, 1993, to October 1, 2000. Title VI: Fisheries Enforcement in Central Sea of Okhotsk - Sea of Okhotsk Fisheries Enforcement Act of 1994 - Amends the Central Bering Sea Fisheries Enforcement Act of 1992 to prohibit U.S. vessels and nationals from fishing in the Central Sea of Okhotsk except in accordance with an international fishery agreement to which the United States and the Russian Federation are parties.

(Sec. 702) Authorizes: (1) an end-of-year strength for active duty personnel of 39,000 as of September 30, 1995; (2) specified military training student loads for FY 1995; and (3) appropriations to the Secretary of Transportation (Transportation) for operation and maintenance expenses of Coast Guard drug interdiction activities for FY 1995. Title VIII: Coast Guard Personnel Management Improvement - Makes provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 1993 regarding homeowners assistance for certain individuals affected by Hurricane Andrew applicable to the military personnel of the Coast Guard who were assigned to, or employed at or in connection with, any Federal facility or installation in the vicinity of Homestead Air Force Base, Florida, subject to specified limitations. (Sec. 802) Repeals a requirement that, upon approval by the President, the names of officers selected by a board for continuation on active duty shall be promptly disseminated to the Coast Guard at large. (Sec. 803) Specifies that reserve members ordered to active duty for emergency augmentation of regular forces shall not be counted in computing the authorized strength of members on active duty or members in grade under any law. (Sec. 804) Authorizes the Commandant of the Coast Guard to: (1) make child development services available to members and civilian employees of the Coast Guard, and, as remaining space is available, to members of the armed forces and Federal civilian employees; (2) require that fees for such services at Coast Guard child development centers be used only for compensation of center employees directly involved in providing child care, with exceptions; (3) use Department of Defense or other training programs to insure that all child development services providers meet minimum standards; and (4) provide assistance to members and civilian employees of the Coast Guard for obtaining services of qualified family home child development services providers. Title IX: Navigation Safety and Waterway Services Management - Repeals a provision requiring the head of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to collect and pay to the Treasury the same fees for the inspection of foreign vessels carrying passengers from the United States that a foreign country charges U.S. vessels trading to the ports of that country. (Sec. 902) Increases civil penalties for violations of provisions regarding documentation of vessels. Revises Federal provisions to make a vessel and its equipment liable to seizure by, and forfeiture to, the U.S. Government if: (1) the owner of the vessel or a representative or agent of the owner knowingly falsifies or conceals a material fact or makes a false statement or representation about the documentation or in applying for documentation of the vessel; (2) a certificate of documentation is knowingly and fraudulently used for the vessel; (3) the vessel is operated after its endorsement has been denied or revoked; (4) the vessel is employed in a trade without an appropriate trade endorsement; or (5) in the case of a documented vessel with only a recreational endorsement, the vessel is operated other than for pleasure. Removes specified limitations on the operation of recreational vessels. (Sec. 904) Amends the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1991 to terminate the Houston-Galveston Navigation Safety Advisory Committee and the Lower Mississippi River Waterway Advisory Committee on October 1, 1999. Title X: Miscellaneous Provisions - Allows the retention of an officer with at least 18 years of active service until such officer completes 20 years of service.
