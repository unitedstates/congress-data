Permits such right to be exercised by a parent or guardian if the victim is under 18, or by one or more family members if the victim is deceased or incapacitated. Subtitle B: Crime Victims' Fund - Amends the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 to revise the formula for allocation of sums in the Crime Victims Fund for costs and grants. Requires the retention of any portion of the Fund that was deposited during a fiscal year that is in excess of 110 percent of the total amount deposited in the Fund during the preceding fiscal year as a reserve for use in a year in which the Fund falls below the amount available in the previous year. Limits such reserve to $20,000,000. Allows any sums awarded as part of a grant that remains unspent at the end of a fiscal year in which the grant is made to be expended for grant purposes at any time during the succeeding two fiscal years, at the end of which year any remaining unobligated funds shall be returned to the Fund. (Sec. 112) Provides that if the compensation paid by an eligible crime victim compensation program would cover costs that a Federal, or a federally financed State or local, program would otherwise pay: (1) such victim compensation program shall not pay such compensation; and (2) the other program shall make its payments without regard to the existence of the crime victim compensation program. (Sec. 113) Limits to five percent of: (1) a grant the amount that may be used for the administration of the State crime victim compensation program receiving the grant; and (2) sums received for the State crime victim assistance program for the administration of such program. (Sec. 114) Authorizes grants for demonstration projects. (Sec. 116) Requires each entity receiving sums made available under the Act for administrative purposes to certify that such sums will not be used to supplant State or local funds, but to increase the amount of such funds that would, in the absence of Federal funds, be made available for such purposes. Subtitle C: Report on Battered Women's Syndrome - Directs the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to report to specified congressional committees on the medical and psychological basis of \"battered women's syndrome\" and the extent to which evidence of the syndrome has been considered in a criminal trial. Title II: Applicability of Mandatory Minimum Penalties in Certain Cases - Amends the Federal criminal code to require the court, with respect to specified drug-related offenses, to impose a sentence pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Commission guidelines, without regard to any statutory minimum sentence, if the court finds at sentencing that: (1) the defendant does not have more than one criminal history point under the Commission's Guidelines Manual; (2) the defendant did not use violence or credible threats of violence, or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce another participant to do so), in connection with the offense; (3) the offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury to any person; (4) the defendant was not an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others (as determined under the Manual) in the offense; and (5) no later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has provided to the Government all information the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan (without regard to whether the defendant has relevant or useful information). Authorizes the Commission to: (1) make such amendments as deemed necessary to harmonize the sentencing guidelines and policy statements with, and the amendment made by, such provisions; and (2) promulgate policy statements to assist in the application of such provisions and such amendment. (Sec. 202) Directs the Commission to promulgate or amend existing sentencing guidelines with respect to cases where statutory minimum sentences would apply but for such provisions to carry out the purposes of such provisions, so that the lowest sentence in the guideline range is not less than two years in those cases where a five-year minimum would otherwise apply. (Sec. 203) Specifies that, with respect to a prisoner the court determines has demonstrated good behavior while in prison, the changes in sentencing made as a result of this Act shall be deemed to be changes in the sentencing ranges by the Commission pursuant to provisions of the Federal judicial code regarding revision of the sentencing guidelines. Title III: Assaults Against Children - Increases penalties for simple assault. Sets penalties for assault resulting in substantial bodily injury. Removes dollar limitations on various types of assaults. Includes assaults against individuals under age 16 committed in Indian country among offenses which are subject to the same law and penalties as all other persons committing such offenses within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. Title IV: Consumer Protection - Sets penalties for insurance industry crimes, including embezzling from insurance companies, making false entries in insurance company books with intent to deceive, and corruptly influencing or obstructing proceedings before State insurance regulatory agencies or insurance examiners. Prohibits persons convicted of criminal felonies involving dishonesty or breach of trust from engaging in the insurance business without the written consent of an insurance regulatory official authorized to regulate the insurer. Title V: Mandatory Life Imprisonment for Persons Convicted of Certain Felonies - Requires that a person convicted in a court of the United States of a serious violent felony be sentenced to life imprisonment if: (1) the person has been convicted (and those convictions have become final) on two or more prior occasions in a court of the United States or of a State of serious violent felonies or serious drug offenses, or any combination thereof; and (2) each serious violent felony or serious drug offense used as a basis for sentencing under such provision, other than the first, was committed after the defendant's conviction of the preceding serious violent felony or serious drug offense.
