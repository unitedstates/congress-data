Requires that the program inventory be revised at the end of each session of the Congress and that such revisions be reported to each House. Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office and the Comptroller General to include in certain reports to the Congress an assessment of the adequacy of functional and subfunctional categories for grouping programs of like missions or objectives.
