Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to appoint a National Child Support Guideline Advisory Board to assist in the bill's development. Subtitle B: Improved Procedures for Establishing Support Orders - Amends SSA title IV part D to revise provisions for State procedures increasing the effectiveness of child support enforcement, with changes made concerning: (1) expedited administrative processes; and (2) enforcement of the national subpoena developed below. Subtitle C: Child Support Registries - Makes changes concerning the establishment of a central State child support order registry (registry) of all child support orders issued or modified in the State and transmittal of registry abstracts to the Division of the National Registry of Child Support Orders (National Registry) established below. (Sec. 112) Requires the SOU to draft and distribute a national subpoena duces tecum for use by child support litigants in obtaining relevant income information. (Sec. 113) Amends the Consumer Credit Protection Act to allow State agency use of consumer report information relevant to the setting of a child support award without a court order. Title II: Collections and Enforcement - Creates a new system requiring employees to report child support information on W-4 forms to their employers, who shall: (1) provide a copy of such form to the National Registry for comparison against registry abstracts; (2) deduct and withhold from employee wages the appropriate amount owed; and (3) send the amount to the appropriate registry for proper disbursement. (Sec. 202) Requires States to adopt procedures suspending the issuance and renewal of occupational, professional, and business licenses, as well as driver's licenses and vehicle registrations, of certain noncustodial parents delinquent in child support payments or subject to an outstanding warrant for failure to appear at a child support proceeding. Modifies other procedures for reporting delinquent parents to consumer reporting agencies. (Sec. 204) Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to qualify as a medical child support order one issued by an administrative adjudicator with the force and effect of law under applicable State law. (Sec. 205) Requires State to have in effect laws adopting the officially approved version of the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act. Title III: Interstate Child Support Enforcement - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish within the Internal Revenue Service an Office of the Assistant Commissioner for Interstate Child Support Enforcement which shall establish the National Registry and a Division of Enforcement to perform specified duties. (Sec. 304) Adds additional requirements for State part D plans, including a requirement that the State child support enforcement agency refer to the Division certain matters involving delinquent parties residing in different States. Title IV: Financing State Child Support Enforcement Activities - Amends SSA title IV part D to repeal provisions on incentive payments to States and provide for a greater share of Federal financial participation with regard to State child support enforcement activities. (Sec. 402) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a Child Support Audit Advisory Committee to assist the Secretary in preparing revised audit criteria for evaluating part D programs. Modifies and shifts to SSA title IV part D payment provisions under part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) providing for a reduction in part A payments as a result of the State's part D program's substantial noncompliance with the requirements of such part. Title V: Effective Dates - Provides effective dates for this Act."
