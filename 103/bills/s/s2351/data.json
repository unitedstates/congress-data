Title I: Health Insurance and Delivery Systems Reform - Subtitle A: Federal Standards for State Regulatory Programs - Amends the Social Security Act (SSA) to add a new title XXI under which States are required to establish accreditation, certification, enforcement, and information programs for certifying all health plans and long-term care policies (except multistate self-insured health plans which will be certified by the Secretary of Labor) issued, sold, offered for sale, or operated in the State that meet certain standards incorporating specified requirements, such as those pertaining to community rating, preexisting conditions, and a patient's right to self-determination in health care services, as certified standard, nonstandard, or supplemental health plans or certified long-term care policies in order to participate in Medicaid. (Sec. 101) Requires establishment of such programs also for: (1) enforcing applicable standards for such plans and policies; (2) providing consumers in the State with comparative value information on the performance of all health plans in each community rating area established in the State; (3) designating State health plan service areas for purposes of access to essential community providers, delivery of benefits, and improved access to underserved areas; (4) providing for reinsurance, risk adjustment, and cost-sharing adjustment programs; (5) specifying an annual general enrollment period; (6) providing for a premium approval process for long-term care policies; (7) providing for the certification of workplace wellness programs; (8) enforcing employer responsibilities with regard to employee access to standard plans; (9) oversight of purchasing cooperatives; (10) supporting quality assurances for measuring access to and appropriateness of health care services provided to consumers; (11) supporting development of community health networks and plans; (12) supporting development of community health networks and plans; (13) providing coordination between health plans and automobile medical liability policies; (14) developing remedy and enforcement mechanisms (including early resolution programs) as described for dealing with complaints involving health plans, collecting any civil monetary penalties assessed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) under such program, and for handling civil actions brought to invalidate any provision of this Act; and (15) conforming State laws and procedures to the rules regarding fraud and medical malpractice under SSA title XI. Directs the Secretary to initially determine and approve the compliance of such State programs with the Federal guidelines under this new title and periodically review such State programs to determine if they continue to comply with such guidelines. Provides funding for such programs. Sets forth requirements relating to: (1) possessions of the United States; (2) State single-payer systems; and (3) treatment of certain State laws. Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop certification criteria for workplace wellness programs; and (2) certify certain private accreditation entities. Describes the various benefit packages and the categories of items and services included in them (such as mental illness and substance abuse services as well as family planning services and services for pregnant women). Prescribes general cost-sharing under the standard benefits package. Creates in HHS a National Health Benefits Board to: (1) establish cost-sharing schedules to be provided by standard packages; and (2) define the standards to be used by a health plan in determining whether an item or service under certain categories of health care items and services is medically necessary or appropriate for an enrollee in the plan. Outlines the process for congressional consideration of any Board recommendations to modify standard benefit packages and cost-sharing assistance. Authorizes appropriations. Sets forth special provisions relating to abortion and religious beliefs, providing that nothing under this new title shall be construed to require the creation or maintenance of abortion clinics or other abortion providers within a State or any region of a State. Details general employer responsibilities pertaining to payroll deductions and other specified matters in enrolling their employees in certified standard health plans. Lists specific duties of purchasing cooperatives, which include making enrollment information available, enrolling community-rated individuals in certified standard health plans, and collecting and forwarding plan premiums to the plan, as well as specific requirements governing the organization and operation of purchasing cooperatives. Provides for access to standard health benefit plan coverage through qualified association plans. Sets forth special rules for church and multiemployer plans. Requires the Secretary to direct the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research and the Health Care Financing Administration to support and conduct research on the effects of health care reform on health care delivery systems and methods for risk adjustment. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Secretary to award grants to States or community-based, independent, not-for-profit organizations that have submitted applications to establish demonstration projects that provide certified standard health plans with the technical assistance to implement the results of quality improvement research into medical practice. Directs the Secretary to submit an annual report to the Congress which: (1) reviews the results of the quality improvement research grants; (2) evaluates consumer information programs established by participating States; (3) tracks the evolution of national performance measures and other research; and (4) evaluates State, regional, and national trends on quality of health care. Allows the Secretary to make grants to and enter into contracts with: (1) eligible public or private non-profit consortia for the development of community health groups (i.e. certified community health plans or community health networks); and (2) community health groups for their operation. Authorizes the Secretary to make certain types of financial assistance available to a community health group or isolated rural facility applying for capital assistance. Directs the Secretary to: (1) award grants to eligible entities to establish demonstration projects to promote telemedicine and other uses of the telecommunications network in rural areas; and (2) establish the Interagency Task Force on Rural Telemedicine to, among other things, identify specific uses for telemedicine that have proven to be effective and review the policy of the Health Care Financing Administration relating to reimbursement for telemedicine services. Subtitle B: Coordination With Other Provisions of Law - Eliminates immunity from antitrust suits under provisions commonly known as the McCarran-Ferguson Act with respect to health insurance. (Sec. 112) Elevates the position of the Director of the Office of Rural Health to the position of the Assistant Secretary for Rural Health and expands that official's duties. (Sec. 113) Permits the Secretary of Labor to issue special reporting and disclosure rules for employer group health plans and make other conforming amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Repeals ERISA provisions on multiple employer welfare arrangements. Title II: Coverage - Amends SSA to add a new title XXII under which is established the National Health Care Commission to monitor and respond to: (1) trends in health insurance coverage; and (2) changes in per-capita premiums and other indicators of health care inflation. Requires the Commission to report to the Congress biennially on the status of health insurance coverage in the nation and the national goal of universal coverage. Authorizes appropriations. Provides that if 95 percent of the resident population is not covered by 2002, the Commission shall submit to the Congress an implementing bill which such statutory provisions as the Commission determines are necessary or appropriate to implement recommendations developed by it to achieve that target. Title III: Premium and Cost-Sharing Assistance - Amends SSA title XIX (Medicaid) to require State Medicaid plans to provide for a State program furnishing premium and cost-sharing assistance in accordance with a new Medicaid part B (State Programs for Premium and Cost-Sharing Assistance), which includes a grant program for providing cost-sharing assistance for certain individuals with incomes above 100 percent of the poverty line.
