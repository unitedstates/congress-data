Grants priority to agencies located in communities adversely affected by recent military base or facility closings. Sets limits on diminishing the size of the police force during the term of such agreements. Authorizes appropriations. Chapter 2: Cops on the Street - Cops on the Street Act of 1993 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Omnibus Act) to authorize the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) to make between 50 and 100 grants to units of local government for the purpose of increasing police presence in the community. Authorizes appropriations. Chapter 3: Police Corps Program - Establishes in the Department of Justice an Office of the Police Corps, headed by a Director. Sets forth: (1) provisions regarding the designation of a lead agency and submission of State plans, scholarship assistance, selection of participants, and service obligation (four years); and (2) State plan requirements. Authorizes appropriations. Chapter 4: Community Policing Grants - Amends the Omnibus Act to authorize the Director of the BJA to make grants to units of local government and community groups to establish or expand cooperative efforts between police and a community for the purpose of increasing police presence in the community. Requires the Director to develop a written model that informs community members regarding identification of the existence of a drug or gang house, civil remedies (such as public nuisance violations and civil suits in small claims court), and mediation techniques. Authorizes appropriations. Chapter 5: Improved Training and Technical Automation - Directs the Attorney General to: (1) make grants to units of State and local law enforcement to improve law enforcement agency efficiency through computerized automation and technological improvements; and (2) expand and improve investigative and managerial training courses for State and local law enforcement agencies, including improvements of the training facilities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Academy at Quantico, Virginia. Authorizes appropriations. Subtitle B: Prisons - Chapter 1: Regional Prisons for Violent Criminals and Violent Criminal Aliens - Directs the Attorney General to construct a minimum of ten regional prisons, situated throughout the United States, each containing space for at least 2,500 inmates. Specifies that at least 50 percent of the overall capacity of such prisons in the aggregate shall be dedicated to qualifying prisoners from qualifying States. Authorizes appropriations. Chapter 2: Federal Grants for State Prison Construction and Operation - Authorizes the Attorney General to enter into agreements with qualifying States to provide construction grants or operating grants for new prisons. (Defines a \"new prison\" as a prison: (1) or city or county detention facility, including an addition to an existing prison or city or county detention facility, certified by the State and approved by the Attorney General as providing additional prison capacity beyond that which the State previously had available or had already planned to construct; and (2) that is principally dedicated to housing repeat violent offenders and sex offenders.) Authorizes the Attorney General to pay up to half of construction and operating costs. Sets forth provisions regarding the canceling and distribution of grants. Authorizes appropriations. Chapter 3: Judicial Remedies for Prison Crowding - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit a Federal court from: (1) holding prison or jail crowding unconstitutional under the eighth amendment except to the extent that an individual plaintiff inmate proves that the crowding causes the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment of that inmate, and limit relief to that necessary to remove the conditions causing such punishment of such inmate; and (2) placing a ceiling on the inmate population of any Federal, State, or local detention facility as an equitable remedial measure for conditions that violate the eighth amendment unless crowding is inflicting cruel and unusual punishment on particular identified prisoners. Requires that each Federal court order seeking to remedy an eighth amendment violation be reopened at the behest of a defendant for recommended modification at a minimum of two-year intervals. Chapter 4: Sentences to Account for Costs to the Government of Imprisonment, Release, and Probation - Amends the Federal criminal and judicial codes, respectively, to: (1) require the court, in determining whether to impose a fine, to consider the expected costs to the Government of any imprisonment, supervised release, or probation component of the sentence; and (2) authorize the U.S. Sentencing Commission to include, as a component of a fine, the expected costs to the Government of any imprisonment, supervised release, or probation sentence that is ordered. Title II: Safe Schools - Establishes an America's Safe Schools Program under which the Secretary of Education may enter into agreements with local educational agencies (LEAs) to pay, and may pay, for a six-year period, the salaries of former members of the armed forces who are hired as teachers assigned to public elementary and secondary schools. Sets limits on diminishing the number of teachers in such schools in the school district served by the LEA during the term of agreement. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 203) Authorizes: (1) a school district to elect to qualify as a Federal safe school district by decision of an LEA or by referendum of the voters in a school district served by an LEA; and (2) the Attorney General to make a grant to an LEA serving a Federal safe school district or to a local law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the school district, as appropriate, to pay for enhanced school security measures. Provides for enhanced mandatory penalties for carrying a firearm into a public or private elementary or secondary school, or possessing a firearm within such a school, that is located within a school district that has elected to qualify as a Federal safe school district. Directs the Sentencing Commission to increase offense levels for such activity. Requires the U.S. Attorney for the judicial district in which the school district is located to prosecute as an adult any juvenile 16 years of age or older who uses or carries a firearm in or within 1,000 feet of a public or private elementary or secondary school. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Criminal Aliens and Alien Smuggling - Subtitle A: Deportation of Criminal Aliens - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to authorize the Attorney General to issue a final order of deportation against any alien who was not lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or who had permanent resident status on a conditional basis, whom the Attorney General determines to be deportable under provisions relating to conviction of an aggravated felony. Limits judicial review of such determinations. Provides for deportation of permanent resident aliens under specified circumstances. Conclusively presumes an alien convicted of an aggravated felony to be deportable from the United States. (Sec. 302) Grants a U.S. district court jurisdiction to enter a judicial order of deportation at the time of sentencing against an alien whose criminal conviction causes such alien to be deportable under provisions relating to conviction of an aggravated felony, if such an order has been requested prior to sentencing by the U.S. Attorney, subject to specified requirements.
