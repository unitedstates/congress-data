Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 102) Prohibits any provision of the Uruguay Round Agreements that is inconsistent with any U.S. law from having any effect. Sets forth provisions governing the Agreements and their effect on State laws and private remedies. Subtitle B: Tariff Modifications - Grants the President, in addition to his other powers to enter into trade agreements regarding trade barriers, the authority to proclaim other modifications of any duty, staged rate reduction, or additional duties as may be necessary to carry out Schedule XX (United States annexed to the Marrakesh Protocol to GATT). (Sec. 112) Amends the Customs and Trade Act of 1990 to declare that the duty on foreign repairs made to U.S.-flag vessels shall not apply to the cost of equipment or spare parts for repairs made to certain U.S.-flag LASH (Lighter Aboard Ship) barges or cargo vessels that enter the United States on or after the date the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement enters into force. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to declare that such duty shall not apply to the cost of spare parts necessarily installed on such vessels before they first enter the United States, but only if a duty is paid under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States upon first entry into the United States on each spare part purchased in, or imported from, a foreign country. (Sec. 113) Directs the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) to liquidate or reliquidate and refund any duties that were paid on: (1) certain agglomerated stone tiles entered into the United States on or after January 1, 1989, and before October 1, 1990; and (2) clomiphene citrate entered into the United States after December 31, 1988, and before January 1, 1993. (Sec. 114) Amends the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to grant duty-free treatment to: (1) unimproved wool and other wool not finer than 46s; (2) octadecyl isocyanate; and (3) 5-chloro-2-(2,4- dichlorophenoxy)phenol. (Sec. 115) Sets forth consultation and layover requirements for actions proclaimed by the President. Subtitle C: Uruguay Round Implementation and Dispute Settlement - Sets forth provisions governing: (1) implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements; (2) WTO dispute settlement panels; (3) review of WTO operations; (4) increased transparency of the costs and benefits of trade policy actions; and (5) access to the WTO dispute settlement process. (Sec. 128) Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to revise the composition of the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations to include representatives from nongovernmental environmental and conservation organizations. Subtitle D: Related Provisions - Directs the President to seek the establishment in the GATT 1947 (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, dated October 30, 1947) and in the WTO of a working party to examine internationally recognized worker rights as they relate to the articles, objectives, and related instruments of such agreement and organization. (Sec. 133) Expresses the sense of the Congress that the United States Trade Representative (USTR) should oppose the admission for membership into the WTO of any country that supports the boycotting of another country. (Sec. 134) Urges the President to develop a comprehensive trade and development policy for African countries. (Sec. 135) Declares that the principal U.S. negotiating objective in the extended negotiations on financial services to be conducted under the auspices of the WTO is to seek to secure commitments from developed and developing countries to reduce or eliminate barriers to the supply of financial services as the condition for the United States: (1) offering commitments to provide national treatment and market access in each of the financial services subsectors; and (2) making such commitments on a most-favored-nation basis. Declares that the principal U.S. negotiating objective in the extended negotiations on basic telecommunications services is to obtain the opening on a nondiscriminatory basis of foreign markets for basic telecommunications services through facilities-based competition or through the resale of services on existing networks. Declares the principal U.S. negotiating objectives in the extended negotiations on trade in civil aircraft are, among other things, to obtain: (1) competitive opportunities for U.S. exports in foreign markets equivalent to those afforded to foreign products in the United States; (2) the reduction or elimination of tariff and nontariff barriers, including through expanded membership in the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft and in the US-EC bilateral agreement for large civil aircraft; and (3) increased transparency with respect to foreign subsidy programs in the civil aircraft sector, maintaining vigorous and effective disciplines on subsidies practices under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (Subsidies Agreement). (Sec. 136) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to repeal the tax on imported perfumes that contain distilled spirits. Grants a drawback (refund) of tax paid on distilled spirits used in the manufacture of imported perfumes. (Sec. 137) Requires unliquidated imported nonrubber footwear from Brazil which is subject to Treasury Decision 74-233, dated September 9, 1974, and which was entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or before October 28, 1981, to be assessed countervailing duties at rates equal to the amount of the cash deposit of the estimated countervailing duties required on such footwear at the time of entry or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption. Title II: Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Provisions - Subtitle A: General Provisions - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require the administering authority, upon receipt of a petition filed requesting a countervailing duty or antidumping duty proceeding, to: (1) notify the exporting country named in the petition by delivering a public version of the petition; and (2) with respect to a countervailing duty proceeding, provide any exporting country named in the petition that is a Subsidies Agreement country an opportunity for consultations. (Sec. 212) Revises provisions regarding countervailing duty and antidumping duty petition determinations with respect to: (1) whether the petition has been filed by or on behalf of an industry; (2) extension of time for filing a petition; (3) polling to determine industry support; (4) comments by interested parties; and (5) termination of a petition where imports of the subject merchandise have been determined negligible. Reduces from 85 days to 65 days after a countervailing duty investigation is initiated the deadline by which the administering authority must determine, based on available information, whether a subsidy is being provided with respect to merchandise which is the subject of such investigation. Reduces the time period on other countervailing duty and antidumping duty determinations. (Sec. 213) Requires the administering authority, whenever making a preliminary or final antidumping duty determination with respect to imported merchandise, to disregard any weighted average dumping margin that is de minimis (less than two percent ad valorem or the equivalent specific rate for such merchandise). (Sec. 214) Requires the International Trade Commission (ITC), whenever there is an affirmative countervailing or antidumping duty finding, to include in its final determination a finding as to whether the subject imports are likely to seriously undermine the remedial affect of the countervailing or antidumping duty order. Revises provisions regarding critical circumstances determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings to require the administering authority to base its determinations on: (1) available information; and (2) in antidumping duty cases, whether there is a history of dumping and material injury by reason of dumped imports in the United States and elsewhere of the subject merchandise. (Sec. 216) Requires the administering authority with respect to countervailing and antidumping duty cases to provide exporters who would have been subject to agreements to eliminate the injurious effect of, or subsidies provided on, their exports, the reasons for not accepting such agreements and an opportunity for them to submit comments. (Sec. 217) Authorizes the administering authority and the ITC to use records compiled in a previously filed and withdrawn countervailing or antidumping duty petition in any subsequent investigation initiated pursuant to any new petitions filed within three months after such withdrawal. (Sec. 218) Sets forth special rules for: (1) countervailing and antidumping duty investigations with respect to agreements to eliminate the injurious effect of, or subsidies provided on, exports that are sold in a regional industry (domestic producers within a region who are treated as a separate industry); and (2) assessment of countervailing or antidumping duties on specific exporters in affirmative regional industry determinations. (Sec. 219) Requires the administering authority, whenever an affirmative antidumping determination is made, to make a preliminary and final determination of: (1) the estimated weighted average dumping margin for each exporter individually investigated; and (2) the estimated all-others rate for all exporters not individually investigated. Requires the administering authority to order the posting of bond for the subject merchandise based on the estimates above. (Sec. 220) Sets forth provisions with respect to: (1) the periodic review of countervailing or antidumping duty orders or notice of suspension of a countervailing or antidumping duty investigation; (2) determinations of antidumping or countervailing duties; (3) revocation of countervailing or antidumping duty orders; (4) termination of suspended countervailing or antidumping duty investigations; (5) administering authority determinations of whether revocation of an order, or termination of a suspended investigation, would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury to an industry, or a countervailable subsidy, or of dumping; (6) revised factors to be considered in threat of injury determinations; (7) negligible imports; (8) cumulation for determining material injury and threat of material injury to an industry; (9) consideration of post-petition information in countervailing or antidumping duty investigations; (10) determination of the normal value of subject merchandise; (11) opportunity for industrial users and consumers of subject merchandise to comment; (12) publication of countervailing or antidumping duty determinations; (13) conduct of countervailing or antidumping duty investigations and the administrative review of such investigations; and (14) antidumping duty petitions by WTO member countries. Subtitle B: Subsidies Provisions - Part 1: Countervailable Subsidies - Defines the term \"countervailable subsidy\" as a financial contribution, any form of income or price support, or any direct or indirect payment by the government of a country or any public entity within a country's territory to a person or a funding mechanism to provide a financial contribution to a person, thereby conferring a benefit. Part 2: Repeal of Section 303 and Conforming Amendments - Repeals a provision of the Tariff Act of 1930 concerning countervailing duties. (Sec. 262) Authorizes the imposition of a countervailing duty (equal to the amount of the net countervailable subsidy) on subject imported merchandise if: (1) the administering authority determines that a foreign country provides a countervailable subsidy with respect to such merchandise; and (2) in the case of merchandise imported from a Subsidies Agreement country, the ITC determines that a U.S. industry is materially injured or is threatened with material injury, or the establishment of a U.S. industry is materially retarded by reasons of such imported merchandise. (Sec. 263) Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) de minimis countervailable subsidies; (2) determination of countervailable, all-others, and country-wide subsidy rates; and (3) the definition of \"developing and least-developed countries\". Part 3: Section 303 Injury Investigations - Requires the ITC, upon a request from an interested party for an injury investigation with respect to a countervailing duty order which applies to merchandise that is a product of a Subsidies Agreement country, to initiate an investigation to determine whether a U.S. industry is likely to be materially injured by such merchandise if such order is revoked. Part 4: Enforcement of United States Rights Under the Subsidies Agreement - Requires the administering authority to provide information to the public upon request, and, to the extent feasible, assistance and advice to interested parties concerning remedies and procedures under the Subsidies Agreement.
