(Sec. 1003) Revises certain qualifying circumstances for the award of contracts between $100,000 and $1 million under noncompetitive procedures. (Sec. 1004) Repeals expiring authority for the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) to enter into master agreements and issue task orders. Creates new authority for the head of a subject agency to: (1) enter into task order contracts for advisory and assistance services; and (2) appoint a task order ombudsman for reviewing complaints involving multiple contracts. (Sec. 1005) Provides for procurement of expert services for court or administrative proceedings. (Sec. 1012) Relocates provisions concerning purchase option evaluation. (Sec. 1013) Requires notice to all offerors not awarded a contract as soon as practicable after the contract is awarded.

(Sec. 1021) Eliminates: (1) certain restrictions on cost and incentive contracts; and (2) annual reports by DOD advocates for competition.

(Sec. 2102) Repeals standby profit controls for use during national emergencies.
