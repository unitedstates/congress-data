Makes individuals aged 16 or older eligible to participate in such program only if they are unemployed at the time of eligibility determination and for at least 15 of the 20 weeks prior to such determination, with specified exceptions. Limits wages for eligible individuals to 52 weeks in a two-year period. Requires that priority be given to those who have exhausted or are otherwise not eligible for unemployment insurance benefits, particularly: (1) those who have been unemployed for the longest periods immediately preceding selection; and (2) those residing in families in which no other member is employed on a full-time basis. Requires that special consideration in selecting participants for employment under this Act in employment counseling and other services for veterans should be given to veterans who otherwise meet participant eligibility requirements. Allows, upon certain determinations, up to ten percent of eligible participants selected by a recipient for subsidized employment from funds under this Act to be individuals unemployed for less than 15 weeks. Makes the State employment service agency, in certifying eligible participants and in referring them for employment under title II or III, responsible for ensuring equal employment opportunities and the full participation of traditionally underrepresented groups. Makes each recipient of funds under title II or III responsible for ensuring such opportunities and such participation in the selection of eligible participants for such employment. Requires that not less than 75 percent of title II and III funds be used to provide wages and employment benefits to eligible participants for work which the recipient certifies has been performed in one or more authorized activities. Permits up to 15 percent of funds provided to a title II or III recipient to be used for the cost of administration and up to ten percent for the acquisition of supplies, tools, equipment, and other materials. Permits payment of such costs from non-Federal sources or Federal sources other than this Act. Requires recipients, to the extent feasible, to ensure that supplies, tools, equipment, or other materials purchased or procured have been manufactured, mined, or produced in the United States. Permits title II funds to be used for costs associated with training and related support for a number of participants, if: (1) employers are committed to fill an equal number of unsubsidized jobs with participants who have successfully completed such training; (2) the recipient has an agreement with a qualified public or private nonprofit provider of such training services; and (3) costs of training and support do not exceed, on a weekly basis, the maximum wage payable with funds under this Act. Limits the rate of salaries or wages paid to administrative or supervisory employees from funds available for administrative costs. Establishes a career preparation demonstration program.

Directs the Secretary of Labor, using the Office of the Job Corps, to establish in each of the Federal regions four career preparation demonstration centers (equitably distributed between rural and urban areas) for combined written, audiovisual, and computer-based materials within the basic instructional format developed by the Job Corps to train eligible participants. Imposes certain requirements on such Centers.

Permits projects which are to be carried out under provisions for public lands conservation, rehabilitation, and improvement to involve lands other than public or Indian lands only when such projects will provide a documented public benefit and when the recipient will be reimbursed for that portion of the total costs of the project which does not provide a public benefit.
