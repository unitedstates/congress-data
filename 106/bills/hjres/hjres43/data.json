Makes the requirement to withhold U.S. assistance and to vote against multilateral development bank assistance contained in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 inapplicable with respect to Mexico until March 1, 2000, if at any time after the date of this Act's enactment the President submits to Congress a determination and certification consistent with that Act that the vital national interests of the United States require that the assistance be provided for Mexico and that the United States not vote against multilateral development bank assistance for Mexico. Deems this Act to have been enacted within 30 calendar days after February 26, 1999, for purposes of certification provisions."
