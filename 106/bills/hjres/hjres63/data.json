    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Declares that a provision of a treaty which denies or abridges: (1) any right enumerated in the Constitution shall have no force or effect; or (2) legislative authority of the several States shall have no force or effect unless ratified by three-fourths of the State legislatures within five years of such treaty's ratification by the Senate. Prohibits: (1) any treaty from authorizing or permitting any foreign power or any international organization to supervise, control, or adjudicate rights of U.S. citizens enumerated in the Constitution or other matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the United States or the several States; and (2) any decision of any international body purporting to interpret treaties to which the United States is a party from being given any precedential effect by Federal or State courts in any proceeding concerning such matters. Requires the enactment of appropriate legislation by the Congress before a treaty becomes effective as internal law in the United States. Declares that any agreement with another nation that has any binding effect on the United States is a treaty subject to the Constitution. Requires the President to transmit to the Senate for ratification the text of a treaty no later than 21 days after that treaty is signed on behalf of the United States."
