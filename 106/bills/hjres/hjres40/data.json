Prohibits the receipts and disbursements of such programs, including program revenues, from being included in either the President's or Congress' budget. States that Congress may make no law authorizing the use of such trust funds (social security as well as hospital insurance trust funds) for any purpose other than for providing for the prompt and effective payment of benefits, administrative expenses, and such amounts as may be necessary and appropriate to correct prior incorrect payments. Bars any agency or instrumentality of the United States, or any officer or employee thereof, from using or authorizing the use of such trust funds for any purpose other than as congressionally authorized in accordance with this constitutional amendment."
