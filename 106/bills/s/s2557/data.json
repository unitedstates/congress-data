Extends the expiration date for authorities related to domestic supply availability from March 31, 2000, to December 31, 2003.(Sec. 202) Extends from FY 1997 through 2003 the authorization of appropriations for the interagency working group that coordinates Federal programs affecting exports of renewable energy and energy efficiency products and services. Extends the expiration date for standby energy authorities from March 31, 2000, to December 31, 2003.(Sec. 203) Instructs the President to establish immediately an Interagency Panel on the Strategic Petroleum Study to study and report to the President and Congress regarding oil markets and estimated future fluctuations in the price, supply, and demand for crude oil, and to determine appropriate SPR capacity and use.Title III: Provisions to Protect Consumers and Low Income Families and Encourage Energy Efficiencies - Amends the Energy Conservation and Production Act to repeal: (1) the requirement that participating States share 25 percent of the cost of weatherization programs as a condition for receiving assistance grants; and (2) the mandate that forty percent of weatherization program funds be spent for weatherization program materials. Instructs the Secretary to establish energy audit procedures and techniques. Increases the financial assistance for labor and weatherization materials expenditures per dwelling unit. Includes among such weatherization materials heating and cooling modification costs, including replacement.(Sec. 301) Repeals the mandate for the Secretary to establish, pursuant to State application, a separate average per dwelling unit limitation.(Sec. 302) Amends the EPCA to direct the Secretary, upon State request, to provide information, technical assistance, and funding for specified actions (summer fill programs) to avoid severe seasonal price increases and supply shortages of kerosene, propane, and heating oil during summer months.(Sec. 303) Authorizes appropriations for an Energy Efficiency Science Initiative, managed by the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, for grants for energy efficiency research.(Sec. 304) Authorizes the Secretary to establish, maintain, and operate a Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (Reserve) (containing no more than two million barrels of petroleum distillate) in the Northeast.
