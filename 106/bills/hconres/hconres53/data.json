    "text": "Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the United States should reaffirm its commitment to the Taiwan Relations Act and the specific guarantees of provision of legitimate defense arrangements to Taiwan contained therein; and (2) Congress has grave concerns over the People's Republic of China's growing arsenal of nuclear and conventionally armed ballistic missiles, the movement of those missiles into a closer geographic proximity to Taiwan, and the effect that buildup may have on stability in the Taiwan Strait. Calls on the President to: (1) direct all appropriate officials to raise with Chinese officials such concerns; (2) seek from Chinese leaders a public renunciation of any use of (or threat to use) force against Taiwan; and (3) provide an annual report detailing the military balance on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, and encourage progress in the cross-strait dialogue. Calls for the Secretary of Defense to inform the appropriate congressional committees when officials from Taiwan seek to purchase defense articles for self-defense. Declares that: (1) the U.S. Government should encourage a high-level dialogue with officials from Taiwan and other U.S. allies in East Asia; and (2) it should be U.S. policy to publicly support Taiwan's admission to the World Trade Organization and encourage others to adopt similar policies."
