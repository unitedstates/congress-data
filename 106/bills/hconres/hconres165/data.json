Calls for such Government to continue to implement programs that may qualify the Slovak Republic for entrance into the European Union and NATO.Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should support efforts for the eventual integration of the Slovak Republic into pan-European and trans-Atlantic institutions, and should view such integration as an important factor in consolidating democratic government and economic stability in the Slovak Republic."
