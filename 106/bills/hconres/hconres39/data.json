Condemns the continued threat to international peace and stability posed by the regime of Saddam Hussein and its refusal to abide by the conditions of UN Security Council Resolutions 686 and 687. Supports the U.S. armed forces who are carrying out their missions in the Persian Gulf. Reaffirms that U.S. policy should support efforts to remove Hussein from power and promote emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime. Encourages the Department of State to find alternative mechanisms to provide humanitarian relief to the Iraqi people."
