Urges both countries to exercise restraint.Calls for the immediate restoration of a civilian, democratically-elected government in Pakistan and the restoration of democracy and the rule of law.Urges the armed forces of Pakistan to respect the human rights of all Pakistani citizens, including those members of the national government who are currently being illegally detained in violation of their constitutional and human rights.Calls on the President not to consider exercising the waiver authority which would be granted to him by the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2000 (presented by Congress on October 14, 1999, for the President's approval), to allow the sale of any military equipment or services to Pakistan, or reinstatement of Pakistan's eligibility for international military education and training, until a civilian, democratically-elected government is returned to power."
