Urges the President not to delay, diminish, or cancel the amounts and kinds of assistance: (1) otherwise appropriate to the people of certain regions in Somalia because conditions may not be propitious for such assistance in other Somali regions; and (2) directed toward any region in Somalia waiting for a permanent resolution of the efforts now underway to forge a new government for Somalia. Calls upon all Somali parties to continue to work toward a permanent end to the civil strife there and the adoption of a permanent governmental structure most conducive to the well-being and basic human rights of all Somali people. Calls on the President to: (1) work with the international community to help bring an end to the suffering of the Somali people and work toward a negotiated settlement of the Somali conflict; (2) increase the levels of humanitarian assistance provided to Somalia; (3) provide funding for demobilization and demining efforts in Somalia; (4) provide assistance in the health and education sectors of Somalia; and (5) work with other donor groups to assist the Somali people in reconstruction and development."
