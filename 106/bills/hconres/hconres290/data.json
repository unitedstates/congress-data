Defines \"directed scorekeeping\" as the act of directing the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) or the Office of Management and Budget how to estimate any provision providing discretionary new budget authority in a bill or joint resolution making general appropriations for a fiscal year for budgetary enforcement purposes.Provides a point of order against consideration in the House of any reported legislation (or amendment or conference report) that would cause the total level of discretionary advance appropriations provided for fiscal years after 2001 to exceed $23.5 billion (the total level of advance appropriations for FY 2001).Terminates this section on January 1, 2001.(Sec. 204) Provides a point of order in the Senate against consideration of legislation or motions that provide an appropriation of new budget authority for any fiscal year: (1) after the budget year that exceeds $23.5 billion; and (2) subsequent to the year after the budget year.Makes a point of order in the Senate against consideration of legislation (excepting defense or recurrent appropriations) or motions that contain an appropriation of new budget authority for any fiscal year which does not become available upon the later of enactment of such legislation or the first day of that fiscal year.Waives or suspends such points of order only by an affirmative three-fifths majority vote. Requires the same majority to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair.Authorizes the Senate Budget Committee chairman to instruct the Senate Finance Committee to report legislation to reduce debt held by the public in an amount consistent with that provided under section 103 of this resolution.Terminates this section on October 1, 2002.(Sec. 205) Provides that the criteria to be considered in determining whether a proposed expenditure or tax change is an emergency requirement in legislation are whether it is: (1) necessary, essential, or vital; (2) sudden, quickly coming into being, and not building up over time; (3) an urgent, pressing, and compelling need requiring immediate action; (4) unforeseen, unpredictable, and unanticipated; and (5) not permanent, temporary in nature. Requires a committee report or the statement of managers to justify why a requirement should be accorded emergency status if it does not meet such criteria.Strikes emergency requirements in legislation under consideration in the Senate when a point of order is sustained against such requirements. Waives or suspends such point of order only by an by an affirmative three-fifths majority vote. Requires the same majority to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair. Makes such point of order inapplicable to any emergency designation for a provision making discretionary appropriations in the defense category.(Sec. 206) Requires the House or Senate Budget Committee chairman, if legislation becomes law that increases the discretionary spending limit for FY 2001 set out in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act), to increase a specified allocation called for in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to the appropriate Appropriations Committee and to adjust all other budgetary aggregates and levels contained in this resolution. Prohibits such allocation from exceeding the total budget authority and outlays set forth under such Act.(Sec. 207) Provides a point of order in the Senate against consideration of legislation that exceeds certain discretionary spending limits in the defense and nondefense categories for FY 2001.
