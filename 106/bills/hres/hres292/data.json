Recognizes the expression of the people of East Timor in favor of independence from Indonesia. Condemns the violent efforts of East Timor militias and elements of the Indonesian military to overturn the results of the vote and notes the failure of the Government of Indonesia to guarantee the security of the people of East Timor. Calls upon such Government to: (1) recognize its responsibilities to cooperate with appropriate UN authorities in the restoration of order in, and the safe return of refugees and other displaced persons to, East Timor; and (2) allow unrestricted access to refugees and displaced persons in West Timor and elsewhere and to guarantee their safety. Urges the international community to investigate the human rights abuses and atrocities which occurred with respect to the situation in East Timor subsequent to August 30 and calls upon the Indonesian Government to hold those responsible accountable. Expresses approval of: (1) the U.S. decision to suspend military relations with, and the sale of military weapons or equipment to, the Indonesian Government until the Indonesian military has effectively cooperated with the international community in facilitating East Timor's transition to independence; (2) Indonesia's belated decision to allow the UN Security Council-endorsed multi-national force into East Timor; and (3) U.S. logistical and other technical support for deployment of such force. Expresses support for a rapid and effective deployment (but declares that this shall not constitute a waiver, or be construed as authority, under the War Powers Act), commends Australia for its willingness to lead the force and for rapidly deploying its initial contingent, and welcomes and commends other specified nations that will participate in this force. Urges: (1) the United States to consider additional measures, including the suspension of bilateral and international financial assistance to the Indonesian Government should it curtail or suspend cooperation with the multi-national force in East Timor, interfere with the full deployment of the multi-national force, hinder the operation of UNAMET, hinder the safe return of refugees and displaced persons to East Timor, or otherwise interfere with the restoration of order and respect for human rights in East Timor; and (2) the Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly to expeditiously ratify the August 30 vote and to otherwise speed the transition to full independence for East Timor. Recognizes that an effective U.S. policy for the region requires both an effective near-term response to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in, and progress toward independence for, East Timor and a long-term strategy for supporting stability, security, and democracy in Indonesia and East Timor."
