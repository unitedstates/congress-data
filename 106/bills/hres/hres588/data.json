Expresses concern about the adoption of laws and regulations by Participating States of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) that discriminate against minority or so-called \"non-traditional\" religions or beliefs and that limit the freedom of individuals to profess and practice religion or belief.Calls upon the President and the Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom to: (1) raise violations of the freedom of thought, conscience, religion, or belief, at every appropriate level with representatives of countries that have failed to implement their international commitments and obligations in this regard; (2) ensure that the United States makes full use of existing meetings and structures of international organizations to raise violations of Participating States' freely undertaken international commitments in this regard; and (3) support the inclusion of experts on religious liberty on U.S. delegations to appropriate meetings of international organizations, including the OSCE."
