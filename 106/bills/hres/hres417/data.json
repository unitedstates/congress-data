Expresses regret and dismay that the FPO under Haider's leadership will play a major role in the new Austrian Government. Commends the leaders of the European Union (EU), the 14 other member states of the EU, Canada, Norway, and other countries which have expressed their serious concerns regarding the participation of the FPO in such Government.Calls upon: (1) the President, the Secretary of State, and other U.S. Government officials and agencies to emphasize to Austrian Government officials the dissatisfaction with the inclusion of the FPO in the Government by not promoting or accepting any official contacts at a political level with officials of that Government which includes the FPO, by giving no support to Austrian candidates seeking positions in international organizations, and by receiving Austrian ambassadors only at a technical level; (2) Members of Congress to refuse to meet with ministers and other political leaders of the Austrian Government and to refuse to meet with members of the Austrian Parliament who are members of the parties participating in the governing coalition; and (3) the American people and others to show their strong disapproval of FPO participation in the Austrian governing coalition by refusing to travel to Austria, use Austrian products and services (including Austrian airlines), or invest in Austrian businesses."
