Urges the President to engage the UN as an intermediary in negotiations between NATO and Slobodan Milosevic to: (1) bring an end to the NATO bombing in Yugoslavia; (2) end the intimidation and expulsion of the Kosovo civilian population; (3) cease all activities of the Yugoslav military and paramilitary forces in Kosovo and to withdraw those forces; (4) facilitate the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes; and (5) deploy an international peacekeeping force to ensure a secure environment for the refugees and humanitarian aid."
