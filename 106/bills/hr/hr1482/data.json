Includes among such revisions the following major changes: (1) extending and reauthorizing the Welfare-to-Work (WtW) program through FY 2000 at reduced levels; (2) changing State mandates to options to expend funds for hard-to-employ recipients and noncustodial parents for whom separate expanded categories of eligibility criteria for WtW services have been created; (3) authorizing WtW services for children aging out of the foster care system; (4) establishing a new minimum level of State expenditures for noncustodial parents for FY 2000; (5) requiring additional specified elements for the State's plan for consideration of the State as a WtW State; (6) replacing requirements for the reversion of unallotted formula funds to the General Fund of the Treasury with requirements for the transfer of unallotted formula funds for use in FY 2000 or 2001 for awarding competitive grants; (7) adding requirements for eligible service providers; (8) modifying requirements for performance bonuses, including set-aside provisions; (9) increasing the reserve for WtW grants for Indian tribes for FY 2000; (10) establishing a reserve for funding technical assistance for entities carrying out WtW projects and modifying the current funding reserves for WtW and abstinence education evaluations; and (11) including job skills training, vocational educational training, and basic education as allowable WtW activities to move individuals into and keep them in lasting unsubsidized employment. Revises requirements for reports to Congress on evaluation of WtW programs. Directs the Secretary of Labor to establish reporting requirements for the collection and maintenance of financial and WtW program participant information."
