Defines such a voucher as a voucher which: (1) is received from a governmental unit in exchange for the performance, by such an individual, of volunteer services for the benefit of such governmental unit; and (2) may be used to satisfy such individual's real property tax liability to such governmental unit. Prohibits a deduction for any real property tax paid using such a voucher to the extent that the amount of such voucher is excluded from gross income."
