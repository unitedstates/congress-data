Allows emergency grants to be used when a student's demonstrated need is not fully funded by the postsecondary institution.Requires organizations to provide outreach support to each participating school's guidance or career counseling staff and provide workshops relating to college admissions, college funding, and financial aid form completion to the general population of each participating school or other interested schools. Requires an organization to provide, at each project site, at least workshops in participating and surrounding school districts.Requires the students selected for program assistance to be nominated by the staffs of the participating high schools. Bases selection primarily on their being college-eligible, first- generation, low-income students. Makes ineligible for program assistance students served by TRIO or GEAR UP programs. Requires students in each State to be selected for program assistance. Requires individual services to begin not later than the end of the tenth grade and continue until completion of college.Requires an applicant organization, in order to qualify for a part L grant, to: (1) be a tax-exempt not-for-profit organization, not affiliated with a public or private educational institution, and not a seller of any kind of financial product; (2) demonstrate experience in the college admissions and college funding arenas, familiarity with Federal outreach programs, prior experience with the public secondary school sector, and a demand by schools and school districts for its program; and (3) provide plans for orderly shift of the funding component from the public to the private sector, for public awareness of the program, the participants, and the outcomes, for counseling services for participants from entry into the program until completion of college, for quantifiable evaluation, and for program implementation.Authorizes appropriations."
