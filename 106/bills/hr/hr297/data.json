Makes the portions of the water supply project constructed with assistance under this title eligible to receive firm power from the program for operation during such period of each year, for as long as the water supply system operates on a not-for-profit basis.(Sec. 106) Provides that this Act shall not: (1) limit the authorization for water projects in South Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota; or (2) preempt State water rights. Specifies the Federal and non-Federal share of the cost. Requires the Secretary to provide funds for the city of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, equal to 50 percent of the incremental cost of its participation in the project.(Sec. 109) Authorizes the Secretary, at the request of the water supply system, to allow the Bureau of Reclamation to provide project construction oversight to the water supply project.(Sec. 110) Specifies that the water supply system shall retain title to all project facilities during and after construction and shall be responsible for all operation, maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation costs.(Sec. 111) Authorizes appropriations.Title II: Sly Park Unit Conveyance - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to convey the Sly Park Dam and Reservoir, the Camp Creek Diversion Dam and Tunnel, and conduits and canals as authorized under the American River Act (Sly Park Unit) to the El Dorado Irrigation District, California.Authorizes the Secretary to receive specified amounts from the District to relieve payment obligations and extinguish debts associated with specified contracts. Provides that upon such payment: (1) the amounts paid shall be credited toward repayment of capital costs of the Central Valley Project in an amount equal to the associated undiscounted obligation; and (2) the Unit shall no longer be a Federal reclamation project or a unit of the Central Valley Project and the District shall not be entitled to receive any further reclamation benefits.Title III: Treatment of Project Costs for Sly Park Unit - Authorizes the Secretary, to the extent costs associated with the Sly Park Unit are included as a reimbursable cost of the Central Valley Project, to exclude such costs in excess of those repaid by Unit beneficiaries from the pooled reimbursable costs of the Project until such time as the facility is operationally integrated into the water supply yield of the Project.Title IV: City of Roseville Pumping Plant Facilities - Directs the Secretary to credit up to a specified amount to the unpaid capital obligation of the city of Roseville, California, as such obligation is calculated in accordance with applicable Federal reclamation law and Central Valley Project rate setting policy, in recognition of future benefits to be accrued by the United States as a result of the city's purchase and funding of the installation of additional pumping plant facilities in accordance with a specified letter of agreement with the United States. Requires: (1) the Secretary to simultaneously add an equivalent amount of costs to the capital costs of the Central Valley Project; and (2) such added costs to be reimbursed in accordance with reclamation law and policy. Provides for the credited amount to take effect upon the date on which: (1) the city and the Secretary have agreed that the installation of the facilities has been completed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the letter of agreement; and (2) the Secretary has issued a determination that such facilities are fully operative as intended."
