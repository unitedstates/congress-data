    "text": "National Small Business Regulatory Assistance Act of 1999 - Amends the Small Business Act to require each participating Federal agency (the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Department of Labor), the Office of Small Business Development Centers (Office) of the Small Business Administration, and representatives of an association representing a majority of small business development centers (SBDCs) to agree to a small business regulatory compliance assistance plan. Requires each participating agency to ensure the nonduplication of compliance assistance efforts.Requires the Office, with the agreement of the association, to develop and publish guidelines for the establishment by SBDCs or by consortia of SBDCs of a system of small business voluntary regulatory compliance (system), with specified guideline requirements. Outlines the assistance to be provided to participating small businesses.Requires annual reports from the Office to the President and the congressional small business committees concerning the assistance provided under this Act, the level of outreach to small businesses achieved by SBDCs and consortia, and recommendations for improvements in the regulation of small businesses participating in the system. Requires the Office to provide for an independent third-party evaluation of the system, to be submitted to the President and the small business committees.Provides funding to assist the Office and participating agencies in fostering, promoting, developing, and carrying out the system, including funds for the implementation and administration of worker safety and health compliance assistance plans and regulatory compliance assistance plans for FY 2000 through 2003. Provides funds to each participating SBDC under a population-based funding formula. Exempts such funds from matching requirements.Prohibits the Office from providing any funds to an SBDC or consortia after September 30, 2000, unless such SBDC or consortia have been approved for funding under a certification requirement."
