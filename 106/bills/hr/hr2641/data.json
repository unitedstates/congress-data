Extends the mandate for such reimbursements through December 31, 2007. Repeals the alternative circumstance that costs be placed into escrow no later than December 31, 2002, and replaces it with the requirement for a plan for subsequent decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, and other remedial action in the case of costs incurred by a licensee after December 31, 2007.Extends from 2005 to 2008 the dateline by which the Secretary must determine whether certain authorized appropriations exceed amounts reimbursable to licensees."
