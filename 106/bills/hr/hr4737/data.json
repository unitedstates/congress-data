Requires each such individual to undergo a polygraph examination within one year after having access to any such vault, in particular within 30 days after first access (or within 120 days after enactment of this Act, if first access occurred on or before enactment).Requires the Administrator for Nuclear Security to ensure that the combination of each lock to each laboratory vault containing Restricted Data is changed not later than 30 days after enactment of this Act."
