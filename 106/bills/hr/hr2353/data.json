Provides that, if the President makes a negative determination with respect to a country, then: (1) the President shall reserve the right of the United States to withhold extension of the application of the WTO Agreement between the United States and the country; and (2) the WTO Agreement shall not apply between the United States and such country until either the President certifies to Congress that the country is fulfilling its obligations under the New York Convention, or a bill submitted to Congress approving the extension of the application of the WTO Agreement between the United States and the country is enacted into law."
