Provides for planning grants to organizations other than qualified organ procurement organizations for the purpose of increasing the supply of transplantable organs. Reassigns from the Secretary to the Network the responsibility for an annual report to specified congressional committees on the scientific and clinical status of organ transplantation.(Sec. 4) Requires a qualified organ procurement organization to be certified or recertified by the Secretary as meeting the performance standards to be such an organization through a process which: (1) granted certification or recertification within the previous four years with such certification in effect as of October 1, 1999, and remaining in effect through the earlier of January 1, 2002, or the date that recertification is completed; or (2) is defined through regulations promulgated by the Secretary by January 1, 2002. Requires such regulations to: (1) require recertifications of qualified organ procurement organizations at most once every four years; (2) rely on performance measures based on empirical evidence of organ donor potential and other related factors in each organization service area; (3) provide for the filing and approval of a corrective action plan by an organization that fails to meet the performance standards, and a grace period of at least three years during which such organization can implement the corrective action plan without risk of decertification; and (4) provide for an organization to appeal a decertification to the Secretary on substantive and procedural grounds.(Sec. 5) Authorizes the Secretary to award grants or contracts for: (1) payment of travel and subsistence expenses incurred toward living organ donation; (2) organ donation studies and demonstration projects; and (3) State outreach activities and programs designed to increase the number of organ donors within the State.
