(8) require one-percent employer contributions under the alternative method of meeting nondiscrimination requirements for IRC 401(k) plans; (9) redefine the term highly compensated employee; (10) revise multiemployer plan provisions with respect to the special limitation rule, the exemption for survivor and disability benefits, the full funding limitation, valuation, and partial termination rules; (11) allow rollovers from and to IRC section 403(b) plans; (12) set forth requirements relating to rollover contributions from deferred compensation plans of State and local governments; (13) permit specified rollovers and make other revisions concerning portability; (14) exclude from gross income, for certain IRC purposes, amounts involved in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to a defined benefit governmental plan, if such transfer is for purchase of service credit under such plan a specified type of repayment; (15) modify requirements for joint and survivor annuities to provide for an alternative joint and 75 percent survivor annuity payable while both the participant and the spouse are alive; (16) treat periods of family and medical leave, under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, as hours of service for purposes of pension participation and vesting."
