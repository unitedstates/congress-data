    "text": "Bounty Hunter Responsibility Act of 1999 - Provides that, for purposes of Acts of Congress providing civil or criminal liability for the deprivation of federally protected rights under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of a State (under color of law), a surety on a bail bond, an agent of such surety, or any bounty hunter seeking to obtain or exercise custody over a person admitted to bail under the laws of a State is acting under color of law.Specifies that, for purposes of such provision, a bounty hunter, if acting as an independent contractor or employee of a surety, is an agent of that surety. Makes an exception where a surety or agent takes all reasonable steps to assure that the bounty hunter is licensed in a State that requires licenses for bounty hunters, or is licensed as a private investigator in a State requiring such licenses.Requires a court, upon finding that a civil action under this section based on the conduct of a bounty hunter is frivolous or has been brought in bad faith, to order the plaintiff to pay the defendant's reasonable attorney's fees and other litigation costs.(Sec. 3) Declares that it shall be the duty of each surety on a bail bond, each agent of such surety, and each bounty hunter, who, in a State, personally seeks to obtain or exercise custody over a person admitted to bail outside that State, before commencing activities in that State, to inform the local law enforcement agency of the presence of such surety, agent, or bounty hunter, and of the intention of that individual to seek to obtain or exercise custody over that person.(Sec. 4) Directs the Attorney General to publish in the Federal Register model guidelines for the State control and regulation of persons employed or applying for employment as bounty hunters. Requires that such guidelines include specified recommendations, such as whether a person seeking employment as a bounty hunter shall be required to obtain adequate liability insurance or to submit to a fingerprint-based criminal background check prior to entering into performance of duties pursuant to employment as a bounty hunter."
