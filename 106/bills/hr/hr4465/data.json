    "text": "Fairness in Textile Trade Act of 2000 - Declares that it shall be U.S. policy to negotiate, within the World Trade Organization (WTO), reciprocal market access in trade in textile and apparel goods, with no concessions in addition to those in effect upon enactment of this Act, unless and until the United States has negotiated substantially similar market access with each WTO member country.Directs the President to determine annually whether each WTO member country allows access in its markets to U.S. textile and apparel goods substantially similar to the access provided in U.S. markets to that country's textile and apparel goods. Requires the President to impose quotas, tariffs, or other measures on the textile and apparel products of any such country whose access allowance for U.S. textile and apparel goods is less favorable than that provided by the United States to that country's textile and apparel goods, in order to make access in the markets of both countries substantially similar.Requires the President to: (1) seek to negotiate agreements with any such country to remove the tariff and nontariff barriers to trade in textile and apparel goods that were the basis of the less favorable access determination; and (2) adjust the measures imposed, if such agreements are reached, to make the reciprocal market access substantially similar.Authorizes civil actions in Federal court by textile and apparel goods producers, distributors, or retailers for damages arising from the fraudulent acts of importers.Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to extend from 26 to 52 weeks the benefit period (including any additional period) for trade readjustment allowances for adversely affected workers enrolled in training programs.Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish a tax credit equal to 50 percent of the amount paid for coverage for the taxpayer and family under qualified health insurance during a period that the taxpayer or spouse is receiving trade adjustment assistance."
