(Retains the current requirement that a recipient must either have received Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) or TANF for 30 months or be within 12 months of losing eligibility because of a time limit.)Prescribes criteria for the provision of project funds to assist certain noncustodial parents to participate in employment or related activities that will enable them to make regular child support payments. Prescribes requirements for such recipients, including an oral or written personal responsibility contract containing certain conditions.Authorizes Welfare-to-Work projects to assist: (1) children between ages 18 and 25 who have received foster care maintenance payments; (2) State TANF recipients with significant barriers to self-sufficiency (as determined according to criteria of the local private industry council); and (3) custodial parents with incomes below 100 percent of the poverty line.Makes vocational educational or job training for up to six months an allowable activity.Permits certain grantees which are not private industry councils or workforce investment boards to provide Welfare-to-Work employment services directly.Repeals the requirement for quarterly State data reports on the Welfare-to-Work program.Reduces the set-aside under provisions for grants for successful performance bonuses.Reduces appropriations for FY 1999."
