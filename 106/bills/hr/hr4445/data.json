    "text": "Reciprocal Compensation Adjustment Act of 2000 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to mandate that no local telecommunications exchange carrier shall be required to make any payment for the transport or termination of telecommunications to the Internet or any provider of Internet access services. Considers such transport or termination as interstate commerce and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission. States that such exemption shall not affect the rights of any parties to interconnection agreements in effect on May 15, 2000. Mandates that a local exchange carrier is not required to offer to any other carrier any reciprocal compensation arrangement that is inconsistent with this Act and that is in an agreement in effect before such date."
