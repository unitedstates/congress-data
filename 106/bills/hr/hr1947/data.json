    "text": "Harbor Services Fund Act of 1999 - Imposes a fee on services provided to commercial vessels for port use based on vessel category and vessel capacity as specified under this Act. Requires that the aggregate amount of such fees in a fiscal year be sufficient to pay the projected total expenditures of the Department of the Army for harbor development, operation, and maintenance for a fiscal year. Requires such fee, with specified exceptions, to be imposed on a voyage basis for such vessels and to be payable by the operator of such a vessel upon entering a U.S. port from a foreign port or at the originating port for domestic voyages. Establishes the Harbor Services Fund into which all fees collected under this Act shall be deposited as offsetting receipts and to which balances in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund shall be transferred. Authorizes amounts in the Fund to be made available for each fiscal year to pay 100 percent of the eligible harbor development costs, the eligible operations and maintenance costs assigned to commercial navigation of all ports within the United States, and the eligible costs of maintaining Federal dredging capability for the Nation. Authorizes, in addition, appropriations of up to $100 million per fiscal year from the Fund for the dredging of berthing areas and construction and maintenance of bulkheads associated with a Federally authorized project and for all or a portion of the non-Federal share of project costs of an eligible non-Federal interest participating in the construction, operation, or maintenance of such a project. Reserves from the balances transferred to the Fund such sums to implement legislation to be enacted to establish the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation as a performance based organization."
