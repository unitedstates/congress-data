Sets forth operating and petitioning procedures. Requires petitions to contain specific evidence establishing certain mandatory criteria, including that: (1) the petitioner has been identified as an American Indian entity on a substantially continuous basis since 1934; (2) a predominant portion of the petitioning group comprises a distinct community and has existed as a community since 1934; (3) the petitioner has maintained political influence or authority over its members as an autonomous entity from 1934 until the present; (4) a governing document or description of membership criteria is submitted; (5) the petitioner's membership consists of individuals who descend from a historical Indian tribe or from tribes which combined and functioned as a single autonomous political entity; and (6) the membership of the petitioning group is composed principally of persons who are not members of any acknowledged North American Indian tribe. Requires the Commission to publish an annual list of recognized Indian tribes. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award petition assistance grants. Authorizes appropriations."
