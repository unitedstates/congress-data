Defines \"qualifying local government\" as a local government whose population of designated emergency response employees has a prevalence of hepatitis C that is not less than 200 percent of the national average for the prevalence of such disease in such populations. Conditions such grants on the local government maintaining confidentiality of information regarding testing or treatment. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on evaluations of such projects and provide recommendations for administrative or legislative initiatives regarding project activities.Authorizes appropriations."
