    "text": "Equity for Temporary Workers Act of 1999 - Prohibits employers from discriminating with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment against any temporary employee. Makes a temporary employee eligible to receive any benefit offered by an employer to other permanent employees after the temporary employee works for the employer for 1,000 hours during a 12-month period, regardless of whether placed by the employer, by a temporary help agency or staffing firm, or under a leasing arrangement by a third party. Requires equal pay for temporary employees. Prohibits employers with employees subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 from discriminating between employees on the basis of employment status by paying wages to temporary employees in the same establishment at a rate less than that at which the employer pays full-time employees for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions. Exempts from such prohibition any such payments made pursuant to: (1) a seniority system; (2) a merit system; (3) a system that measures earning by quantity or quality of production; or (4) a differential based on any other factor other than employment status. Amends the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to require employers to furnish each employee a place free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm. Sets forth enforcement provisions with respect to violations of this Act, including civil actions by employees and administrative and injunctive actions by the Secretary of Labor."
