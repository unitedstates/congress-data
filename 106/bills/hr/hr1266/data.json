Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should: (1) maintain its leadership role within a more effective UN, and continue to seek to lower the long-term costs associated with U.S. participation; (2) continue its efforts to persuade other UN members to support a broad agenda for reform, budgetary discipline, and equitable financial burdensharing; and (3) promptly negotiate a reduction in its assessed contribution for any UN peacekeeping operation to an amount not greater than 25 percent of the total amount of all assessed contributions for such operation."
