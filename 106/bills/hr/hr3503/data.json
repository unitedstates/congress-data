Provides a new termination date for such reports.Amends FIRREA to extend such annual survey to include credit unions.Amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to prohibit the imposition of electronic fund transfer fees upon a consumer by the operator of an electronic terminal (automatic teller machine, or ATM) if: (1) that operator is not the financial institution holding the consumer's account; and (2) the fund transfer utilizes a national or regional communication network to effect the transaction with the financial institution holding the consumer's account."
