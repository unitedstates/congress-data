Recognizes that, because of the Wilderness Area's proximity to the U.S.-Mexican international border, drug interdiction, border operations, and wildland fire management operations need to continue so long as they are conducted in accordance with the Wilderness Act and any conditions the Secretary of the Interior considers appropriate. Declares that such designation is not intended to lead to the creation of protective buffer zones around the Wilderness."
