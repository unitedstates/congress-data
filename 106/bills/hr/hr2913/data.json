Limits the aggregate amount of such grants to a particular unit of local government for a fiscal year to $300,000.Sets forth grant eligibility requirements, including assurances that: (1) the grant will be used only to employ, as part of the juvenile justice system administered by such local governmental unit, one or more qualified juvenile accountability coordinators, subject to specified requirements (including record-keeping requirements); and (2) if a juvenile complies with a diversion accountability plan, such local governmental unit will not adjudicate the offense with respect to which such plan is developed.Sets forth reporting requirements. Authorizes appropriations."
