    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1999-05-10", 
    "text": "National Institute of Standards and Technology Authorization Act of 1999 - Authorizes appropriations for FY 2000 and 2001 to the Secretary of Commerce for: (1) the Scientific and Technical Research and Services laboratory activities of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); (2) the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Program; (3) construction and maintenance of NIST facilities; (4) activities of the Under Secretary for Technology and the Office of Technology Policy; and (5) Industrial Technology Services activities of NIST. Prohibits funds authorized for construction of NIST facilities in FY 2001 from being obligated unless the Secretary of Commerce has certified to the House Science Committee and the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee that the obligation of funds is consistent with a plan for meeting NIST's facility needs that the Secretary has transmitted to those committees. Authorizes appropriations for FY 2000 to the Secretary of Commerce for the National Technical Information Service. Amends the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act with respect to the Advanced Technology Program (ATP), including to: (1) allow the Secretary, acting through the NIST Director (the Director), to participate in industry-led U.S. joint research and development ventures (joint ventures) if such participation is appropriate (current law) and the non-Federal participants in such a joint venture agree to pay at least 60 percent of the total costs during a Federal participation period that shall not exceed five years; (2) eliminate provisions providing that Federal participation by means of grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts may include provision of a minority share of such joint ventures costs for up to five years; (3) require that grant recipients (other than small businesses) provide at least 60 percent of project costs; and (4) require research projects to be of a nature and scope that would not be pursued in a timely manner without Federal assistance. Authorizes the Secretary, acting through the Director, to vest title to tangible personal property in any recipient of financial assistance under the ATP if: (1) the property is purchased with ATP funds; and (2) the vesting of such property furthers NIST's objectives. Vests title to intellectual property arising from ATP assistance in a company or companies incorporated in the United States (current law) or any other participant in a joint venture receiving financial assistance under the ATP, as agreed by the parties. Requires the Director to exclude from consideration for grant agreements made by NIST after FY 1999 any person who received funds (other than due to membership in a class specified by law for which assistance is awarded to class members according to a formula) appropriated for a fiscal year after FY 1999 under a grant agreement from any Federal funding source for a project that was not subjected to a competitive, merit-based award process, except as specifically authorized by this Act. Makes such an exclusion effective for a period of five years after receipt of such Federal funds."
