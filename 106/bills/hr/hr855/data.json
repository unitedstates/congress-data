(Current law requires, in addition to other provisions of law and notwithstanding a specific exclusion of dredged material, that the dumping of dredged material in Long Island Sound from any Federal project (or by Federal authorization) or from a dredging project by a non-Federal applicant over 25,000 cubic yards comply with ocean dumping requirements.)"
