Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to withdraw the United States from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and negotiate an agreement on the method of settling accounts with the IMF. Requires the Secretary to report on alternative ways of addressing the problems that the IMF is designed to address, including reliance on the operation of private capital markets, merging the IMF with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and establishing an institution to address such problems in a different manner than the IMF has addressed such problems."
