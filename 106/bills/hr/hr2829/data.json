(Eliminates the poultry slaughter provision from such definition.) Extends: (1) administrative enforcement authority to live poultry dealers; (2) injunctive or restraining order authority to instances of poultry care; and (3) the Secretary of Agriculture's authority to issue a complaint against a live poultry dealer to any violation of such Act."
