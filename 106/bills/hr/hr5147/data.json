Provides for the waiver of such prohibition.Title II: Certificates of Origin - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to issue regulations requiring diamonds (including products made in whole or in part from diamonds) which enter, or are withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, into the U.S. customs territory to be accompanied by a certificate stating the English name (or unmistakable abbreviation) of the country in which the diamonds were mined. Sets forth both civil and criminal penalties for violations of the requirements of this Act.Title III: International Efforts - Urges the President to: (1) take immediate action to develop and implement an effective international system for controlling trade in rough diamonds, and to direct the appropriate Federal agencies to begin implementation of such a system; and (2) once a global certificate of origin system for rough diamonds is in place, take appropriate steps to fully adhere to such system, and to actively promote international compliance.Title IV: Special Representative on Conflict Diamonds - Directs the President to appoint a Special Representative on Conflict Diamonds to: (1) serve as chairperson of an interagency working group, which the President shall also establish to address issues relating to the use of proceeds from the sale of diamonds mined in certain regions in Africa to support armed conflict there; and (2) represent the United States at international meetings with respect to such issues."
