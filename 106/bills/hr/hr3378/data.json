Requires the Inspector General of the Department of State to monitor and report to Congress on such contract.Requests the Secretary of State to give the highest priority to the negotiation and execution of a new Treaty Minute or a modification of Treaty Minute 283 in order that the other provisions of this Act to address river and ocean pollution in the border region may be implemented as soon as possible. Requests the Secretary to initiate such negotiations with Mexico. Requires the new or modified Treaty Minute to be subject to the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.Authorizes appropriations."
