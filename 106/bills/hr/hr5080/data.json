Repeals the requirement for a reduction in payments for such projects in the extension period so that total Federal expenditures do not exceed what they would have been had the projects not been extended. Adds specified terms and conditions for the conduct of any such demonstration project for the period of October 2000 through December 2001, with specified reduced basic capitation rates for certain project services. Declares that a targeted case management fee shall be paid only for enrollees classified as moderate or at risk through a baseline health assessment. Requires greater uniformity in clinical features among project sites. Requires enrollee satisfaction surveys and reporting on specified quality indicators for the enrolled population.Makes this Act effective as if its amendments were included in the enactment of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999."
