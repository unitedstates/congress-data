    "text": "Clean Power Plant Act of 1999 - Amends the Clean Air Act to require specified emissions limitations on mercury, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units with a nameplate capacity of at least 15 megawatts that use a combustion device primarily to generate electricity for sale. Requires quarterly pollutant-specific emission reports for such pollutants and for carbon dioxide (CO2) by unit owners or operators. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to publish facility-specific emission data.Requires regulations for disclosure of data concerning emissions levels.Directs the Administrator to calculate a generation performance standard for CO2 from covered fossil fuel-fired electric generating units and allocate allowances among such units.Authorizes the carryover and trading of unused allowances and requires surrender to the Administrator of a number of CO2 allowances equal to the total tonnage emitted during the calendar year. Permits the performance standard to be exceeded if the plant has sufficient emissions credits. Imposes an excess emissions penalty and requires units to offset such emissions.Requires regulations concerning transfer of hazards associated with combustion from one medium to another and release of hazardous wastes into the environment.Expresses the sense of Congress concerning crediting permanent CO2 and NOx emissions reductions to the utility sector in any enacted climate change implementation program.Authorizes appropriations for industry and community assistance and development of a carbon sequestration strategy.
