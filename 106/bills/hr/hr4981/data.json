Provides that by January 1, 2005, standard patient assessment instruments established under this section shall be the sole patient assessment instrument utilized by the Secretary with respect to Medicare and Medicaid items and services.(Sec. 216) Directs the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality to develop and make available in electronic format an authoritative, reliable national resource center for serious and disabling chronic illnesses, to be used by patients and their families that include information necessary for patient education and facilitate self-management.Subtitle C: Payment Incentives for Furnishing Quality Services to the Chronically Ill - Creates within the Federal Supplemental Medical Insurance Trust Fund the Performance Bonus Pool Account to consist of amounts attributable to certain reductions in payments to Medicare+Choice organizations.
