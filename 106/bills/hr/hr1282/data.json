States that a discharge in bankruptcy shall not include consumer debts owed to a single creditor and aggregating more than $1,000 for luxury goods or services incurred by a debtor within 90 (currently 60) days before such discharge. Deletes a provision which prohibits an interested party in a bankruptcy proceeding from requesting a dismissal of such action."
