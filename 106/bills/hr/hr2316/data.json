Authorizes the Secretary, acting through the CDC, to expand research relating to: (1) encouraging preconception counseling; (2) identifying critical components of prenatal delivery and postpartum care, outreach and support services for pregnant women, and women who are at high risk for complications; (3) preventing preterm delivery, urinary tract infections, and unnecessary caesarean sections; (4) examining the higher rates of maternal mortality among African American women and the relationship between domestic violence and maternal complications and mortality; and (5) preventing substance abuse during and after pregnancy and infections that cause maternal and infant complications. Authorizes the Secretary, acting through the CDC, to carry out activities to promote safe motherhood, including public education campaigns on healthy pregnancies, education programs for health care providers, and activities to promote community support for pregnant women.
