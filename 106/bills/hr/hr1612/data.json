Prohibits retaliation against employee or other whistleblowers or against a person who refuses to violate a law, rule, or regulation. Applies specified FDCA provisions to this Act for this Act's administration and enforcement.Authorizes the Secretary to impose traceability requirements on a type or class of food when necessary to assure the protection of public health.Allows any person to commence a civil action against: (1) any person who violated any rule, tolerance, order, or other action of the Secretary to ensure food safety; or (2) the Secretary for alleged failure to perform any nondiscretionary act or duty.Title IV: Authorization - Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act."
