    "text": "Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize a State to enforce laws regulating, and collecting fees for, the treatment and disposal within such State of solid waste generated in another State. Exempts specified types of waste from regulation under this Act. Grants congressional approval to agreements or compacts entered into by two or more States for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance for solid waste management. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate regulations exempting waste types or recycling practices from the authority granted to States under this Act if such action promotes the development of an interstate market for recyclable materials or is necessary to promote environmentally sound waste disposal practices."
