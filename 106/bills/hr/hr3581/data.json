Provides that such an appointment shall not affect the member's uniformed service status or pay and allowances.Prohibits taking into account the acceptance of an appointment to a 2000 census position for purposes of applying requirements pertaining to the repayment of a voluntary separation incentive payment by reason of an individual's accepting subsequent reemployment with the Government or any other similar provision of law, rule, or regulation.Prohibits the earning or receipt of compensation for service performed by an individual in a 2000 census position from causing: (1) any individual to become ineligible for any benefits provided under any Federal program or any State, or local program financed with Federal funds; or (2) a reduction in the amount of any such benefits. Declares that nothing in such provision shall be considered to apply with respect to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986."
