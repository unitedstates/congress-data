Requires that such teaching: (1) occur within the ten-year period after they complete the postsecondary education for which the scholarship was awarded; and (2) not exceed six years. Reduces such teaching agreement requirements by one-half in the case of individuals who teach in shortage areas established by the Secretary.Authorizes appropriations."
