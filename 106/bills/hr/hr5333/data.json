    "text": "Federal Employees' Overtime Pay Limitation Amendments Act of 2000 - Amends Federal Civil Service provisions regarding the computation of overtime pay to: (1) require that, for a Federal employee whose basic pay is at a rate which exceeds the minimum rate of basic pay for GS-10, the overtime hourly rate of pay is an amount equal to the greater of one and one-half times the minimum hourly rate of basic pay for such grade or the hourly rate of the employee's basic pay, and all that amount is premium pay; and (2) provide that, for any pay period during which an employee is engaged in work in an emergency (including a wildfire emergency) that involves a direct threat to life or property, including work performed in the aftermath of such an emergency, the overtime hourly rate of pay is an amount equal to one and one-half times the hourly rate of the employee's basic pay, except that such overtime hourly rate of pay may not exceed the greater of one and one-half times the minimum hourly rate of basic pay for GS-12 or the hourly rate of the employee's basic pay, and all that amount is premium pay.Revises provisions regarding limitations on premium pay to: (1) allow an employee to be paid premium pay under certain circumstances only to the extent that the payment does not cause the aggregate of basic pay and such premium pay to exceed the greater of the maximum rate of basic pay payable for GS-15 or the rate payable for level V of the Executive Schedule; (2) provide that such limitation shall not apply to an employee who is paid premium pay by reason of work in connection with an emergency; (3) prohibit such an employee from being paid such pay if, or to the extent that, the aggregate of the basic pay and premium pay would, in any calendar year, exceed the greater of the maximum rate of basic pay payable for GS-15 or the rate payable for level V of the Executive Schedule; (4) authorize the Office of Personnel Management to prescribe regulations governing the applicability of the two preceding amendments to employees who are in receipt of annual premium pay for standby duty or administratively uncontrollable overtime work or availability pay for criminal investigators; and (5) prohibit applying such provisions to certain employees of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Defense."
