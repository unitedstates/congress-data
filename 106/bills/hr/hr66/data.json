Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) enter into cooperative agreements; (2) accept donations of funds, equipment, supplies, and services as appropriate; (3) provide cost-share grants for up to 50 percent of projects for the preservation of the corridor and information about existing cost-share opportunities and technical assistance in the corridor's historic preservation and interpretation; and (4) coordinate, promote, and stimulate research by other persons and entities regarding the corridor. Requires the Secretary: (1) to provide assistance in the preservation of the corridor that is compatible with the idiosyncratic nature of the highway; (2) not to prepare or require an overall management plan, but to cooperate with public and private entities in developing local preservation plans to guide efforts to protect the most important or representative resources of the corridor; (3) to develop a technical assistance program in the preservation and interpretation of the corridor, including guidelines for setting priorities for preservation needs; and (4) to coordinate a program of historic research, curation, preservation strategies, and collection of oral and video histories of events that occurred along the corridor designed for continuing use after the Cultural Resource Programs are terminated.
