Requires that: (1) each team include State and local law enforcement personnel; and (2) investigations, responses, and prosecutions of methamphetamine-related crimes be carried out under the direction of the State or local law enforcement personnel who have criminal jurisdiction.Prohibits such a team from including Federal law enforcement personnel beyond two years after the date of the team's establishment, with an exception.Directs the Attorney General to ensure that any Federal assistance provided with respect to a team is provided in a manner that: (1) maximizes that team's ability to function effectively after Federal assistance has ended; and (2) achieves the equitable distribution of that assistance to rural communities."
