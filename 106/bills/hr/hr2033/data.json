States that a candidate meets the requirements of this Act if: (1) in the case of a television broadcast, the reference is made by the candidate in a personal appearance on the screen; and (2) in the case of a radio broadcast, the reference is made by the candidate in a personal audio statement during which the candidate and the office are identified."
