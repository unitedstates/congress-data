Makes such an election effective as if included in BBA '97.Directs the Secretary to report to Congress and the Comptroller General (CG) on the costs incurred by Medicare home health agencies in complying with the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) patient data collection requirement. Requires the CG to conduct an independent audit of such costs for a report to Congress.Amends SSA title XVIII to eliminate the incremental billing requirement with respect to home health service visits under the Medicare program."
