Provides that whenever the Commissioner of Social Security requests information from a State for the purpose of ascertaining an individual's eligibility for, or correct amount of, OASDI or SSI benefits, the standards of the Commissioner promulgated pursuant to any Federal law for the use, safeguarding, and disclosure of information are deemed to meet any standards of the State that would otherwise apply to the disclosure of information by the State to the Commissioner. Directs the Commissioner to conduct a study and report to specified congressional committees on possible measures to improve fraud prevention with regard to SSA title II disability benefits and administrative processing with regard to SSA title XVI benefits. Amends SSA title VII (Administration) to require inclusion by the Commissioner in the annual Social Security Administration budget of the amounts necessary to combat applicant and beneficiary fraud. Title II: Benefits for Philippino (sic) Veterans of World War II - Amends SSA title XVI to provide for reduced SSI benefits to certain individuals who served in the military forces of the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines while such forces were in the service of U.S. armed forces during World War II who move back to the Philippines, and for so long as they reside in the Philippines."
