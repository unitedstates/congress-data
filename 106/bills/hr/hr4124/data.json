Requires program enrollment to be voluntary. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) waive enrollment fees; (2) modify existing TRICARE program contracts to incorporate enrollment provisions; and (3) establish cost-sharing requirements for enrollees.(Sec. 104) Provides for the determination of DOD reimbursement amounts for individuals enrolled in Medicare part A and individuals not enrolled in Medicare part B.(Sec. 105) Requires the Secretary to maintain current DOD health-care efforts for Medicare-eligible retirees in order to avoid imposing added costs to the Medicare program. Requires specified estimates of prior efforts and future targets with respect to DOD health care provided under the subvention program.Directs the Comptroller General to determine and report to the two Secretaries and Congress annually on the extent, if any, to which costs of the Secretary under the TRICARE program and the HHS Secretary under the Medicare program have increased as a result of the subvention program. Requires the Secretaries to take necessary action to offset any added costs.(Sec. 106) Requires the Secretary to reimburse subvention program participants for any late enrollment penalties imposed under the Medicare part B program.(Sec. 107) Provides that, in the case of a Medicare-eligible uniformed services retiree who seeks to enroll in a Medicare supplemental policy, the issuer of such policy may not: (1) deny the issuance or effectiveness of such policy; or (2) discriminate in the policy's price.Makes eligible for: (1) the subvention program an individual who was eligible to enroll under Medicare part B and who did not enroll in the Medicare program during his or her initial enrollment period; and (2) the Medicare supplemental program an individual who was eligible to enroll under Medicare part B.Title II: FEHBP Option for Retirees - Revises provisions concerning a demonstration project which includes certain covered military retirees and their beneficiaries within the Federal Employees Health Benefits program (FEHBP) to: (1) make such program permanent (currently terminates December 31, 2002); (2) remove certain reporting requirements; and (3) remove provisions concerning the application of Medigap protections to demonstration project enrollees.(Sec. 202) Requires the health and dental care benefits provided under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) and TRICARE Standard to be the same as those provided for the highest level of benefits under the service benefit plan of the FEHBP.Title III: Other Matters - Directs the Secretary to: (1) expand and make permanent the DOD demonstration project for providing pharmaceuticals by mail to permit Medicare-eligible uniformed services retirees and certain military dependents to participate in such project. Prohibits fees for project participation.(Sec. 302) Directs the Secretary to issue to covered beneficiaries under the TRICARE program an enrollment card for nationwide TRICARE program participation."
