Provides that nothing shall preclude NASA from leasing or otherwise using a commercially provided inflatable habitation module if such module would: (1) cost the same or less than the remaining cost of completing and attaching the baseline habitation module; (2) impose no delays to the Assembly Sequence; and (3) result in no increased safety risk. Directs NASA to report to Congress on substituting any inflatable habitation module or other inflatable structures for one of the elements included in such Assembly Sequence.(Sec. 128) Prohibits any funds authorized by this Act from being used to create a Government-owned corporation to perform the functions that are the subject of the Consolidated Space Operations Contract.Title II: International Space Station - Directs the Administrator to report bimonthly, until October 1, 2006, on whether or not the Russians have performed work expected of them and necessary to complete the International Space Station.Directs the President to notify Congress of the decision on whether or not to proceed with permanent replacement of the Russian Service Module, other Russian elements in the critical path of the Space Station, or Russian launch services.Requires the United States to seek assurances from the Russian Government that it places a higher priority on fulfilling its commitments to the Space Station than it places on extending the life of the Mir Space Station. Declares that the Administrator, if any international partner in the Space Station Program willfully violates any commitments or agreements for the provision of Space Station-related hardware or related goods or services, should seek a commensurate reduction in such partner's utilization rights until such commitments or agreements have been fulfilled. Directs the Administrator to seek to reduce NASA's share of Space Station common operating costs.(Sec. 202) Limits (excluding funding and costs of the Station and space shuttle launch with respect to operations, research, or crew return activities subsequent to substantial completion of the Space Station, missions on which at least 75 percent of the shuttle payload by mass is devoted to research, and space shuttle safety and reliability) the total amount that may be appropriated for: (1) costs of the Space Station; and (2) space shuttle launch costs in connection with Space Station assembly. Provides for increases attributable to: (1) the lack of performance or the termination of participation of any of the participating countries; (2) loss or failure of a U.S.-provided element during launch or on-orbit; (3) on-orbit assembly problems; (4) new technologies or training to improve safety; and (5) the need to launch a space shuttle to ensure safety of the crew or maintain Station integrity.Requires the Administrator to provide written notices of such increases to specified congressional committees. Requires the Administrator, as part of the annual Shuttle program and Station budget request, to identify the costs for assembly and development of the Space Station and for shuttle research missions to which cost limitations do not apply.(Sec. 203) Directs the Administrator to contract with the National Research Council and the National Academy of Public Administration to conduct a study of the status of life and microgravity research as it relates to the Space Station.(Sec. 204) Amends the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000 to require the Space Station commercial development demonstration program to apply to commercial use agreements entered into prior to Space Station completion or the end of FY 2002 (currently, FY 2004), whichever is earlier.(Sec. 205) Directs the Administrator to enter into an agreement with a non-Government organization to conduct Space Station research utilization and commercialization management activities subsequent to substantial completion.Title III: Miscellaneous- Requires the Chief Financial Officer for NASA, before any funds may be obligated for Phase B of a project that is projected to cost over $150 million, to conduct an independent life-cycle cost analysis of such project and report the results to Congress.(Sec. 302) Amends the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 to require: (1) the President to submit to the Congress the annual aeronautics and space report in May (currently, January); and (2) such report to address activities on a fiscal (currently, calendar) year basis.(Sec. 303) Expresses the sense of Congress that NASA shall: (1) purchase commercially available space goods and services to the fullest extent feasible; and (2) not conduct activities with commercial applications that preclude or deter commercial space activities, except for national security or public safety reasons.(Sec. 305) Bars NASA from entering into any agreement or contract with a foreign government that grants such government the right to recover profit in the event that the agreement or contract is terminated.(Sec. 307) Directs the Administrator to arrange for an independent study to reassess priorities of all Space Shuttle upgrades under consideration but for which substantial development costs have not been incurred and that: (1) are safety related; (2) may have functional or technological applicability to reusable launch vehicles; and (3) have a payback period within the next 12 years.(Sec. 308) Directs the Administrator to develop a plan for the integration of research, development, and experimental demonstration activities in the aeronautics transportation technology and space transportation technology areas.(Sec. 309) Expresses the sense of Congress that the Administrator should ensure consistent NASA usage of specified definitions of: (1) commercialization; (2) commercial purchase; (3) commercial use of Federal assets; (4) contract consolidation; and (5) privatization.(Sec. 310) Directs the Administrator to: (1) arrange for an independent study to identify and evaluate the potential benefits and costs of the broadest possible range of commercial and scientific applications which are enabled by the launch of Space Shuttle external tanks into Earth orbit and retention in space; and (2) conduct an internal agency study of what improvements to the current Space Shuttle external tank and other in-space transportation or infrastructure capability developments would be required for the safe and economical use of such external tank for any or all of the applications identified.(Sec. 311) Requires the Administrator to provide notice to specified congressional committees on reprogramming and reorganization matters.(Sec. 312) Amends the Unitary Wind Tunnel Plan Act of 1949 to include hypersonic wind tunnel construction within the scope of covered research and development facilities.(Sec. 313) Directs the Administrator to establish a Human Space Flight Innovative Technologies program of ground-based and space- based research and development in innovative technologies.(Sec. 314) Directs the Administrator to arrange with the National Academy of Sciences for a review of international efforts, and enhancements that can be made to NASA's efforts, to determine the extent of life in the universe.(Sec. 315) Requires the Administrator to develop a carbon cycle remote sensing applications research program to provide a comprehensive view of vegetation conditions, assess and model agricultural sequestration, and encourage the development of commercial products. Directs the Administrator to use regional earth science application centers to carry out the program.
