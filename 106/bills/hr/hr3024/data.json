    "text": "Netizens Protection Act of 1999 - Prohibits any person from initiating the transmission of an unsolicited electronic mail (e-mail) message in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce if such message: (1) does not contain the name, physical address, and e-mail address of the sender; (2) does not provide an electronic method for contacting the sender to request that no further messages be sent; or (3) is part of a bulk transmission of such messages and includes information that is false or misleading with respect to the body of the message. Provides a private right of action for violations of such prohibition.Requires each interactive computer service provider to make available to each of its customers its policy regarding unsolicited e-mail, including options for the customer to elect to receive or not receive such e-mail. Prohibits customers from using the equipment or facilities of the provider to initiate the bulk transmission of an unsolicited e-mail message if the provider's policy prohibits such bulk transmissions. Provides a right of action for providers adversely affected by customer violations of such prohibition.States that a provider who in good faith takes action to restrict or prevent the receipt of unsolicited e-mail by its customers shall not be liable for any harm resulting from the failure to prevent such receipt."
