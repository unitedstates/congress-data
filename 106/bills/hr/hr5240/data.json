Limits the annual number of such status adjustments.Directs the Attorney General to appoint a child welfare professional or trained individual as such alien's guardian ad litem.Expresses the sense of Congress commending the Immigration and Naturalization Service for issuance and implementation of specified children's asylum claims guidelines.Directs the General Accounting Office to report with respect to U.S. embassy and consular efforts to reunify on a priority basis children in foreign countries with parents who are legally present in the United States."
