Repeals a provision directing the Administrator of General Services to furnish each former President suitable office space. Revises provisions concerning the authority of the Secret Service to protect a former President to, among other things, reduce the period of such protection from lifetime protection to protection for the one-year period immediately following the termination of a President's service as President, unless there is a threat to kill, kidnap, or do bodily harm to such former President."
