Requires a report from the FCC to Congress on the future spectrum needs of telemedicine and telehealth providers, including emergency medical services providers. Requires the FCC, until such rules take effect, to maintain any allocations of frequencies for biomedical telemetry operations that are in existence on January 1, 1999, except that any television broadcast station authorized by the FCC to initiate digital television service may initiate such service in accordance with FCC rules and policies in effect on such date."
