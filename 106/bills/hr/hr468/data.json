Requires lands acquired by the United States under this Act to be treated as entitlement lands solely for purposes of payments in lieu of taxes to local governments.Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, within three years of acquiring 50 percent of the land authorized for acquisition, to develop an amendment to the land and resources management plan for the Hiawatha National Forest which will direct management of the scenic area.Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed as affecting the jurisdiction or responsibilities of Michigan with respect to fish and wildlife in the Area.Withdraws the lands within the Area from disposition under U.S. mineral and geothermal leasing laws. Prohibits the Secretary from allowing any mineral development on federally-owned land within the Area, except for construction and maintenance of roads and facilities within the Area.Allows the Secretary to acquire: (1) land and structures within the Area to further the purposes of this Act; and (2) not more than ten acres of land (and improvements) on the mainland to provide access to, and administrative facilities for, the Area.Authorizes appropriations."
