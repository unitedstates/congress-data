Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to: (1) review and amend, as appropriate, the sentencing guidelines for offenses involving such substances and their analogues; (2) report to Congress; and (3) ensure that the sentencing guidelines for such offenses reflect the serious nature of such offenses. Amends CSA to require that any person convicted for possession of such substances or their analogues be sentenced to up to three years' imprisonment, a fine, or both. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) specify gamma butyro-lactone as a list I chemical in the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988; and (2) establish programs throughout the United States and disseminate materials to provide young people in high school and college with education about the use of controlled substances in the furtherance of rape and sexual assault and assist law enforcement personnel in the prevention of controlled substances abuse for such purposes."
