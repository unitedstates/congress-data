    "text": "Electric Energy Empowerment Act of 1999 - Amends the Federal Power Act (FPA) to empower the States to order electric utilities within their jurisdiction to provide nondiscriminatory open access through functionally unbundled transmission and local distribution services to retail customers within their borders (retail wheeling). Prescribes implementation guidelines.(Sec. 4) Encourages creation of Independent Transmission System Operators to ensure that all sellers and buyers of electricity in the United States have access to nondiscriminatory transmission services.(Sec. 5) Redefines \"public utility\" to include electric utility or Federal power marketing agencies not otherwise subject to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission jurisdiction (FERC), (thereby subjecting such entities to FERC open access rules).(Sec. 6) Rescinds the requirement that new electric utility contracts or obligations for the purchase or sale of electric energy or capacity be conducted pursuant to the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA).Directs FERC to promulgate and enforce regulations to assure recovery by electric utilities of all costs associated with purchases of electric energy or capacity pursuant to PURPA prescriptions.Repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.(Sec. 7) Mandates Federal and State access to such holding company records as FERC and State commissions deem relevant to costs incurred by such entities, and as appropriate for the protection of consumers with respect to rates. Repeals FPA conflict of jurisdiction prescriptions.(Sec. 8) Grants the consent of Congress for the formation and operation of the Electric Reliability Council (ERC), a body composed of all electricity industry participants, to: (1) provide the best technical electricity industry advice and recommendations to FERC; and (2) submit an annual status report to the President, Congress, and to FERC on the Nation's electric generation, transmission, and distribution systems.Retains State regulatory authority regarding the safety and reliability of electric utility or local distribution company facilities."
