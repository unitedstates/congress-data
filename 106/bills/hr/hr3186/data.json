Empowers DOJ and FTC with primary authority to review mergers involving the proposed assignment or transfer of any license issued under the Act. Authorizes the FCC to file comments in any such proceeding.States that, if DOJ or FTC reviews a merger and issues either a written decision of approval or a written statement of nonintervention in such merger, then the FCC shall authorize the assignment or transfer of any license involved therein. Prohibits the FCC from imposing any other term or condition on the assignment or transfer of such license, or imposing any other obligation on any party to such merger.Prohibits the FCC from reviewing any application for assignment or transfer of a license issued under the Act in connection with a merger unless neither DOJ nor the FTC issues a decision or statement in connection with such merger. Requires the FCC to conclude any review so conducted within 60 days after DOJ or FTC issues such a decision or statement."
