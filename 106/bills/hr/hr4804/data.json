Requires the fuel tax rate reduction to be the amount which will result in a reduction in revenues to the United States equal to the amount of fines paid. Directs the Secretary to provide for tax rate reductions in any region which are proportional to the extent of the conduct (to which the fine relates) which occurred in the region.Requires the Secretary to take steps to ensure that reductions under this Act are reflected in the retail price of the fuel."
