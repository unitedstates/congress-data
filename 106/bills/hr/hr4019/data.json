Requires all action on such applications to be completed within 90 days after FCC receipt, unless the applicant requests an extension. Provides a 60-day deadline with respect to FCC action on an application for the acquisition by one local exchange carrier or its affiliate of the securities or assets of another local exchange carrier in which the acquiring carrier does not, and after such acquisition will not, have ownership or control of more than two percent of the subscriber lines installed in the aggregate in the United States."
