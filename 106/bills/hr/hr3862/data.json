    "text": "Aircraft Safety Act of 2000 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit, and set penalties for, knowingly and with intent to defraud, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce: (1) falsifying or concealing a material fact, making any materially fraudulent representation, or making or using any materially false writing, entry, certification, document, record, data plate, label, or electronic communication concerning any aircraft or space vehicle part; (2) exporting from or importing or introducing into the United States, selling, trading, installing on or in any aircraft or space vehicle any part using or by means of a fraudulent representation, document, record, certification, depiction, data plate, label, or electronic communication; or (3) attempting or conspiring to commit any such offense.Grants the U.S. district courts jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations pending final determination of such a proceeding. Specifies that a final judgment rendered in favor of the United States shall stop the defendant from denying the essential allegations of the criminal offense in any subsequent civil proceeding brought by the United States.Sets forth provisions regarding forfeiture of property, lack of preemption, and applicability to conduct occurring outside the United States under specified circumstances.Makes violation of this Act a predicate to authorization for interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications."
