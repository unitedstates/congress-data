Authorizes civil actions against parties in violation of such agreements.(Sec. 209) Requires the Administrator to implement an employee incentive awards program that rewards employees and organizational units that demonstrate leadership in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of innovative environmental strategies and other activities that result in better environmental performance, greater economic efficiency in the public and private sectors, and expedited delivery and improved quality of public services.(Sec. 211) Authorizes appropriations to carry out this title."
