Declares that nothing in this Act shall: (1) restrict the first amendment rights of any person; and (2) prohibit a person from providing financial support to the U.S. Olympic Committee, any U.S. sports governing body, or any organizing committee for any Olympic games already awarded by the IOC upon the enactment of this Act. Sets forth a civil penalty for violation of the requirements of this Act."
