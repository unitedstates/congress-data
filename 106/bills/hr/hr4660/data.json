Requires the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) to maintain a list of LEAs denying such access. Provides that, if an LEA denies such access, the Secretary of the military department concerned shall provide for an officer to meet with representatives of such LEA to attempt to arrange such access. Provides that, if such LEA continues to deny such access, then the Secretary shall transmit to the Chief Executive of such State a notification of the denial of recruiting access and a request for assistance in obtaining such access.Provides that if, after the above process, an LEA continues to deny such access, the Secretary shall: (1) determine whether such LEA denies such access to at least two of the armed forces; and (2) upon an affirmative determination, include such LEA on the maintained list.Amends the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2000 to repeal an exception for student financial assistance from a ban on Federal grants and contracts to institutions of higher education denying access to Reserve Officers' Training Corps or other military recruiters."
