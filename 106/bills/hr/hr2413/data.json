Authorizes appropriations for carrying out the study.(Sec. 11) Directs the Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology (Under Secretary) to: (1) promote an increased use of security technologies to enhance the protection of the Nation's information infrastructure; (2) establish a central repository of information for dissemination to the public to promote awareness of information security vulnerability and risks; and (3) promote the development of national, standards-based infrastructures needed to support government, commercial and private uses of encryption technologies for confidentiality and authentication.(Sec. 12) Directs the NIST Director to: (1) develop technology-neutral electronic authentication infrastructure guidelines and standards to enable Federal agencies to select and utilize electronic authentication technologies in a manner that is sufficiently secure and interoperable; (2) maintain and make available to Federal agencies and the public a nonmandatory list of commercially available electronic authentication products, and other such products used by Federal agencies, evaluated as conforming with such guidelines and standards; (3) establish core specifications for particular electronic certification and management technologies by Federal agencies and advise Federal agencies for evaluating the conformance of such systems with such criteria; (4) maintain and make available to Federal agencies a list of such systems evaluated as conforming to such criteria; and (5) transmit annual reports to Congress on progress and problems in implementing electronic authentication infrastructures.(Sec. 13) Authorizes appropriations."
