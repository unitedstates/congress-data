Requires the provider to take appropriate action after notice from a Federal or State law enforcement agency that the provider's service is being used for such prohibited purposes. Authorizes alternative injunctive relief against such a provider under certain limitations and considerations.Exempts a provider who takes any action to remove or disable access, in compliance with this Act, from liability for damages, penalty, or forfeiture.
