Requires such plan to include an instruction by the Secretary to the U.S. Executive Director of each international financial institution to use the vote of the United States to oppose the use of funds appropriated or made available by the United States for any non-humanitarian assistance, until: (1) the institution has adopted an anticorruption plan that requires the use of independent third-party procurement monitoring services in which the country receiving such assistance lacks the necessary organization, resources, and expertise to ensure openness, efficiency, and transparency in government procurement; and (2) each recipient country institutes specific strategies for minimizing corruption and maximizing transparency in each stage of the procurement process.Prohibits the use of funds for nonhumanitarian foreign assistance programs (including Agency for International Development (AID) activities) unless each recipient country and each international financial institution has demonstrated that significant progress is being made toward institutionalizing: (1) procurement practices that are open, transparent, and free of corruption, fraud, inefficiency, and other misuse; and (2) independent third-party procurement monitoring of government procurement in countries that lack necessary organization, resources, and expertise.Specifies national security, emergency humanitarian, and other exceptions to the requirements of this Act."
