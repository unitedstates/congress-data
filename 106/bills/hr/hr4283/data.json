Conditions grants on a grantee achieving a specified maintenance of effort requirement with respect to expenditures from other sources for remediation programs. Requires grant applicants to demonstrate that project remedial actions have been selected only after consideration of specified health and environmental risks, benefits, impacts, implementation likelihood, and costs.Authorizes appropriations.Title II: Moratorium on Exports of Bulk Fresh Water - Prohibits the export from the United States of bulk fresh water from the Great Lakes Basin. Makes such prohibition inapplicable on the earlier of: (1) December 31, 2001; or (2) the effective date of an Act of Congress approving an agreement among the Great Lakes States to implement a mechanism that provides for a common conservation standard to make decisions concerning the withdrawal and use of water from the Basin. Defines \"bulk fresh water\" as fresh water extracted in amounts intended for transportation by tanker or similar form of mass transportation without further processing."
