Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) repeal the inclusion in an employee's gross income of employer-provided coverage (through a flexible spending or similar arrangement (FSA)) of qualified long-term care services; (2) allow the carryover of amounts in excess of the maximum amount of reimbursement under an FSA; and (3) exclude from gross income the reimbursement of long-term care insurance premiums by FSAs (as well as the reimbursement of health insurance premiums during unemployment)."
