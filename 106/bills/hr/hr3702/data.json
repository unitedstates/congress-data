    "text": "Recruit and Reward Future Math and Science Teachers of America Act of 2000 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to establish a pilot program for recruitment and training of future secondary school mathematics and science teachers.Makes available 500 scholarship grants and stipends to outstanding students enrolled in nationally accredited teacher training graduate programs who are committed to pursuing such careers in secondary school mathematics and science teaching.Authorizes appropriations. Designates funds under this Act as National Math and Science Teacher Scholarships. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award funds for such scholarships on a competitive basis to qualifying higher education institutions with graduate programs in teacher training. Limits the amount of such funds in any academic year which may be awarded to any individual higher education institution.Makes an institution eligible for such funds only if it is ranked by the Secretary in the top 25 percent of schools in its State with the highest percentage of graduates passing the State teacher qualification assessment for new teachers. Directs the Secretary to give priority to eligible institutions that have one or more of these: (1) a year-long internship program in a professional development school; (2) mentoring programs for novice teachers in their first three years; (3) a history of placing graduates in rural and urban schools; and (4) a high retention rate of teachers that the institution places in teaching positions.Sets forth eligibility requirements for individual scholarships. Limits the scholarship amount per student to $10,000 per academic year. Requires scholarship recipients to agree to teach in an urban or rural public secondary school for at least three full academic years, or repay the pro rata amount of awards received, plus interest, for any failure to fulfill such obligation. Sets forth exceptions to such repayment requirements."
