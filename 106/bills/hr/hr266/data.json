Directs the Secretary to: (1) collect such information in a central data system in a manner that will enable compilation of separate statistics concerning incidents that involve campers, staff members, and recreational camp operators and directors; and (2) report to the President, the Congress, the National Association of Governors, and the National Association of State Legislatures on a comprehensive analysis of the information. Authorizes the Secretary to issue advisories to assist States in the prevention of deaths, injuries, and illnesses at recreational camps. Requires a recreational camp to record information in a medical log concerning an incident that is required to be reported and such other illnesses and injuries that occur at the camp as the Secretary may prescribe. Requires the Secretary to advise each State agency that has legal responsibility for public health and each State agency that issues a license to a recreational camp of any failure by a camp to comply with any requirements of this Act. Title II: President's Advisory Council on Recreational Camps - Establishes the President's Advisory Council on Recreational Camps to develop model safety guidelines for recreational camps."
