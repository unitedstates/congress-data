Provides that Federal funds paid to a State for medical assistance provided to certain working disabled individuals must be used to supplement but not supplant the level of State funds expended as of FY 1999 for programs to enable working disabled individuals to work. (Sec. 102) Extends Medicare (SSA title XVIII) coverage for OASDI (SSA title II) disability benefit recipients who are using tickets to work and self-sufficiency (TWSS). (Sec. 103) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) award grants to eligible States to support establishment of State infrastructures to support the working disabled as well as to enable State outreach campaigns on infrastructure existence; and (2) submit a recommendation to specified congressional committees on whether such grant program should be continued after FY 2010. Authorizes and makes appropriations. (Sec. 104) Authorizes State demonstration projects under which Medicaid coverage equal to that afforded under the State option provided for above for eliminating income, assets, and resource limitations for disabled workers buying into Medicaid is provided for up to a specified maximum number of workers with a potentially severe disability. Authorizes and makes appropriations. Title II: Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program - Amends part A (General Provisions) of SSA title XI to direct the Commissioner of Social Security to establish a Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program (TWSSP) under which a disabled beneficiary may use a TWSS issued by the Commissioner under a described system, designed to ensure quality assurance, to obtain employment, vocational rehabilitation, or other support services, pursuant to an appropriate individual work plan meeting specified requirements, at the Commissioner's expense, from a participating employment network, public or private, which: (1) meets specified qualifications and is under an agreement with the Commissioner who must select a program manager to assist in administering TWSSP; (2) is chosen by the beneficiary, and (3) is willing to accept assignment of the beneficiary's TWSS. Allows State agencies administering or supervising the administration of the State plan under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to elect to participate as an employment network. Sets forth special requirements applicable to cross-referral to certain State agencies and requirements relating to provision of services. Describes employment network payment systems. Provides that during any period for which an individual is using a TWSS, the Commissioner and any applicable State agency may not initiate a continuing disability or similar review with regard to whether the individual is or is not disabled. Authorizes to be transferred from the social security trust funds each fiscal year such sums as may be necessary to carry out this title with respect to SSA title II disability beneficiaries. Directs the Commissioner to establish a corps of trained, accessible, and responsive work incentive specialists to specialize in SSA title II and title XVI disability work incentives for the purpose of disseminating accurate information to disabled beneficiaries with respect to inquiries and issues relating to work incentives. (Sec. 204) Establishes within the executive branch the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Advisory Panel to advise the Commissioner with respect to TWSSP, and furnish progress on TWSSP to the President and Congress. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 205) Directs the Commissioner to conduct certain demonstration projects designed to provide for specified reductions in disability insurance benefits based on earnings. Requires expenditures for such demonstration projects to come out of the social security and Medicare trust funds to the extent provided in advance in appropriation acts. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct and report to Congress on various described studies concerning existing disability-related employment incentives and coordination of the OASDI disability insurance program and the SSI program as they relate to individuals entering or leaving concurrent entitlement under such programs. Title III: Technical Amendments - Amends the Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996 with respect to: (1) final adjudication of denied claims by drug addicts and alcoholics for SSA title II disability benefits; and (2) the effective dates of certain requirements concerning representative payees and treatment referrals for drug addicts and alcoholics. (Sec. 302) Amends SSA title II to: (1) provide for payments to State and local prisons for monthly reports on the identities of inmates whose OASDI benefits are determined by the Commissioner not to be payable as a result of such reports; (2) provide for a 50 percent reduction in such payments under SSA titles II and XVI in cases involving a comparable payment under the other title with respect to the same prisoner; (3) exempt from the Privacy Act of 1974 any agreements with State and local prisons to supply such information; (4) transfer from the social security trust funds any sums necessary to enable the Commissioner to make such payments; (5) eliminate the requirement that confinement stem only from a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year (thus denying OASDI benefits to individuals confined for any criminal offense); and (6) provide for continued denial of benefits to sex offenders remaining confined to public institutions upon completion of prison term. (Sec. 303) Provides for a two-year open season for members of the clergy who wish to revoke their exemption from social security coverage . (Sec. 304) Amends SSA title XI to make a miscellaneous technical amendment relating to cooperative research or demonstration projects under SSA titles II and XVI. (Sec. 305) Amends SSA title XI to make miscellaneous technical amendments to provisions concerning the requirements of State income and eligibility verification systems to, among other changes, allow a State to permit certain employers that make returns with respect to domestic service employment taxes on a calendar year basis to instead make such reports on an annual basis."
