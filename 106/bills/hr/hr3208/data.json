    "text": "Daniel Keysar Memorial and Childhood Consumer Product Safety Act of 1999 - Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act (the Act) to require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to establish a comprehensive list of all children's products subject to recall or corrective action over the last 15 years and to make such list widely available to the public, State and local governments, and the secondary market (including retail stores and child care facilities) through its toll free telephone hotline, electronic mail, and web site listings. Requires Commission recall announcements to: (1) state clearly the nature and extent of the product hazard and potential injury risk; and (2) include the number of known deaths, injuries, and incidents associated with the product being corrected.Directs the Commission to: (1) establish a pilot program to work with manufacturers and retailers to obtain the identity of consumers who purchase specified children's products so that such consumers can be notified in the event of a product recall; and (2) report to Congress annually on the effectiveness of recalls for each specific product and to determine the percentage of recalled products which are actually repaired or corrected.Increases and extends through FY 2003 the authorization of appropriations under the Act."
