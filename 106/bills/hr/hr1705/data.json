    "text": "Amends the Clean Air Act to waive, in ozone nonattainment areas, a certain requirement that reformulated gasoline have an oxygen content equal to at least 2.0 percent by weight if reformulated gasoline that contains less than such percentage and meets all other requirements will achieve an equivalent or greater reduction in total actual emissions of ozone precursors, particulate matter, and potency-weighted toxic air pollutants than that resulting from the the gasoline that meets such percentage requirement. Requires certain regulations regarding motor vehicle fuels to prohibit the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether as a fuel additive. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to enter into arrangements with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study of all oxygenates used as gasoline additives and their combustion byproducts to determine their effects on public health and the environment and the availability of alternatives. Makes study results available to the public."
