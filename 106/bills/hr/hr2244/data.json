    "text": "United States-Panama Security Act of 1999 - Bars U.S. assistance to Panama during any period in which a defense site or military installation located in Panama that was at any time part of a site or installation built or formerly operated by the United States has been conveyed by the Government of Panama to any foreign government-owned entity. Directs the President to instruct the U.S. representatives to the international financial institutions to oppose any loans or other assistance to Panama during any such period. Requires the President to report to the Congress on how Hutchison Whampoa, a Chinese firm with ties to the Chinese Government, was selected to receive a grant for management control of the Panamanian ports of Balboa and San Cristobal. Directs the Secretary of Defense to report to the Congress on: (1) the extent to which the control of such ports by such firm poses a threat to U.S. security; and (2) how U.S. strategic interests with respect to the Panama Canal will continue to be protected after the Government of Panama assumes sole responsibility for the defense of the Canal and becomes the only entity entitled to have military forces, defense sites, or military installations in Panama after December 31, 1999. Requires: (1) the Director of Central Intelligence to report annually to the Congress on the intelligence activities of China against or affecting U.S. interests in Panama; and (2) the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy to report to the Congress on the utility of maintaining a military presence in Panama for interdicting illegal drugs. Authorizes and directs the President to confer with the Government of Panama to renegotiate the terms of the Panama Canal Treaty and the Treaty Concerning the Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal or to negotiate a new agreement to supersede such treaties. Expresses the sense of the Congress that any negotiations should include: (1) a ban on foreign government investment in or management of the Canal and related projects; (2) the right to a continued U.S. military presence in Panama and a continued presence to interdict and eradicate illegal drug trafficking through Panama; and (3) the right to control or prohibit the use of the Canal by hostile powers, terrorist states, or criminal groups by redefining the terms of the 1977 Treaty Concerning the Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal."
