Requires such FICA tax rate to be the rate estimated by the Secretary to reduce revenues to the United States during such year in an amount equal to the Federal budget surplus for the fiscal year ending during the preceding calendar year, subject to adjustments to the extent prior estimates were in excess of or less than the actual revenue reductions. Declares that any change in budget authority, outlays, or receipts resulting from this Act shall not be considered for purposes of calculating the deficit increase for any year under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman- Hollings Act)."
