    "text": "Requires the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to jointly establish a pilot program to award competitive grants to assist local governments in reducing air pollution by covering the costs associated with converting their entire municipal vehicle fleet to an ethanol-blended fuel. Limits the number of grants to five, with preference given to governments that have a recognized air pollution problem in their communities.Declares that a local government must agree to cooperate in a study to assess the economic and environmental benefits to be gained from exclusive use of ethanol-blended fuel to power municipal vehicles. Requires the Secretaries and the Administrator to report study results to Congress."
