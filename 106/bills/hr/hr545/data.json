    "text": "SSI Fraud Prevention Act of 1999 - Amends titles II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) and XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI) of the Social Security Act (SSA), as well as other related SSA titles, to outline various fraud-related prevention measures concerning the OASDI and SSI programs, including the following measures for: (1) making representative payees primarily liable for repayment of deceased recipient overpayments; (2) requiring provision of State prisoner information to Federal and federally assisted SSI benefit programs; (3) providing for recovery of SSI benefit overpayments from lump sum SSI benefit payments; (4) establishing rules under the OASDI and SSI programs relating to collection of overpayments from individuals convicted of crimes; (5) adding additional debt collection mechanisms to the SSI program from the OASDI program; (6) providing for the treatment of assets held in trust under SSI; (7) rendering an individual or the spouse of an individual who disposes of resources for less than fair market value under the SSI program on or after a described look-back date ineligible for SSI benefits for a certain monthly period; (8) mandating loss of benefits as a penalty for SSI- and OASDI-related fraud; (9) excluding attorneys and physicians convicted of specified violations (including any criminal violation relating to an initial application for, or continuing entitlement to, or eligibility for, OASDI or SSI benefits, respectively) from participation in the social security disability programs under SSA titles II and XVI; (10) requiring annual reviews by State disability determination services under SSA title II of professionals conducting consultative examinations; (11) mandating periodic computer matches under SSA title XVI with Medicare and Medicaid (SSA titles XVIII and XIX, respectively) institutionalization data maintained by the Secretary of Health and Human Services; and (12) authorizing access to the Commissioner of Social Security under SSA title XVI to any financial institution record with respect to the applicant for, or recipient of, SSI benefits whenever the Commissioner determines such record is needed for a benefit or eligibility determination. Provides that whenever the Commissioner requests information from a State for the purpose of ascertaining an individual's eligibility for, or correct amount of, OASDI or SSI benefits, the standards of the Commissioner promulgated pursuant to any Federal law for the use, safeguarding, and disclosure of information are deemed to meet any standards of the State that would otherwise apply to the disclosure of information by the State to the Commissioner. Directs the Commissioner to conduct a study and report to specified congressional committees on possible measures to improve fraud prevention with regard to SSA title II disability benefits and administrative processing with regard to SSA title XVI benefits. Amends SSA title VII (Administration) to require inclusion by the Commissioner in the annual Social Security Administration budget of the amounts necessary to combat applicant and beneficiary fraud."
