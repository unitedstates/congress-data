    "text": "Veterans Compensation Equity Act of 2000 - Authorizes the concurrent receipt of veterans' disability compensation and military retired pay, without deduction from either, for individuals who retired from the armed forces with at least 20 years of service, were awarded the Purple Heart, and have a service-connected disability.Makes the rate of dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) for the surviving spouse of a veteran who was awarded the Purple Heart the same as the rate of compensation for service-connected disability or death that would be paid to a veteran if the veteran were not deceased (thereby continuing the DIC payment beyond the veteran's death).Makes annuities under the Survivor Benefit Plan 100 percent of the base amount. (Currently, such annuities are specified percentages of such base amount based on age.) Repeals: (1) the requirement for annuity reduction at age 62; and (2) an alternative computation of such annuity for certain beneficiaries. Requires the recomputation of existing annuities due to amendments made by this Act."
