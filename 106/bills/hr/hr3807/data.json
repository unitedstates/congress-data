    "text": "Stable Oil Supply Home Heating Act - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to mandate that voluntary plans for home heating oil reserve be submitted to the Secretary of Energy by importers, refiners, and wholesalers holding oil inventories for sale to markets in the Northeast in order to ensure stability in energy fuel markets and to protect consumers from dramatic price swings. Prescribes implementation and certification guidelines, including an antitrust defense for actions taken in compliance with this Act. Exempts certain small-sized importers and refiners.Directs the Secretary to: (1) issue an order requiring the establishment of a private home heating oil reserve for the Northeast if a certified plan has not been implemented within a specified time frame for an importer, refiner, or wholesaler that stores heating oil for sale in the Northeast; (2) periodically monitor supply levels to ensure that home heating oil inventories in the Northeast are adequate to supply customer needs during the present or following winter season so as to obviate sudden price increases caused by inadequate inventories; (3) require an importer, refiner, or wholesaler to increase its inventory if the Secretary determines that inventories are insufficient; and (4) establish civil penalties and cooperate with State energy authorities in carrying out this Act.Instructs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to take action to enable importers, refiners, or wholesalers to sell their remaining excess inventories at the end of each winter season."
