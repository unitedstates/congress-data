Includes among such efforts: (1) tobacco-related research aimed at preventing tobacco addiction and State-wide advertising to discourage tobacco use; and (2) assistance in economic development efforts designed to aid tobacco farmers and workers and communities as they transition to a more broadly diversified economy."
