Considers housing containing less than three bedrooms inadequate housing for such member.Directs the Secretaries of the military departments to require the military base housing office of each installation to review and revise its housing market analysis and military family housing requirements to accommodate such policy.Prohibits military housing construction funds appropriated before this Act from being obligated until such Secretaries certify to Congress that: (1) such analyses and requirements have been revised; and (2) the unobligated funds will be used to accommodate such policy and implement such analyses and requirements."
