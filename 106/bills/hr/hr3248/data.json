Directs the Secretary to make a progress report to Congress with respect to such requirements.Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director, to conduct prevention research on HPV. Directs the Secretary to make a progress report to Congress on such research and develop a final proposal. Requires such report to outline steps needed to make HPV a reportable disease and the best strategies to prevent future infections.Directs the Secretary to require the Department of HHS and HHS contractors and grantees to specifically state the effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of condoms in preventing the transmission of HPV, herpes, and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in all publicly available informational materials related to condoms or STDs.Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to deem a condom to be misbranded unless its label bears information providing that condoms do not effectively prevent the transmission of HPV and that HPV can cause cervical cancer."
