Includes within the scope of the new credit up to $4,000 ($8,000 in the case of two or more qualifying individuals) of respite care expenses incurred in the care of: (1) a dependent of the taxpayer who is under the age of 13 years old; (2) a dependent who is physically or mentally incapable of self-care; or (3) a spouse who is physically or mentally incapable of self-care."
