(Sec. 3) Establishes the Beryllium Exposure Compensation Trust Fund in the Treasury. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to administer the Fund. Requires amounts in the Fund to be: (1) invested in accordance with specified law; and (2) available only for disbursement by the Attorney General (AG) under this Act. Terminates the Fund after 30 years. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 4) Requires an eligible beryllium worker to receive $100,000 if the AG determines that the claim filed by or on behalf of that individual meets certain requirements for payment. Makes individuals eligible if they: (1) were employed at a beryllium industry site; (2) were exposed to significant beryllium hazards in the course of such employment; and (3) after such exposure developed a condition known to be related to beryllium exposure. (Sec. 5) Directs the AG to establish: (1) procedures for claims submission and payment, including documentation of individual employment and exposure, as well as written medical documentation of the development of a related condition; and (2) guidelines for claims determination, in consultation with other specified Federal officials. Sets forth claims payment requirements, including provisions for: (1) payments to, and claims by, survivors; and (2) treatment of payments under other laws. Requires the AG to complete each claim determination within 12 months after the claim is filed. (Sec. 11) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to Congress by the end of FY 2003 on the incidence of beryllium-related illness among workers employed at beryllium industry sites. (Sec. 12) Provides for budget Act compliance."
