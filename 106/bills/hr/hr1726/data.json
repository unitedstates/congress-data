(Sec. 102) Amends such Act to: (1) require each State which receives grants to allocate not less than six (currently, five) percent of funds received to the improvement of criminal justice records; and (2) authorize the use of such funds to develop or expand a State instant criminal background check system that includes allowing only such limited access. Title II: Nonrefundable Credit for Purchase of Safe Storage Devices for Firearms - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a non-refundable personal credit against Federal income tax for qualified firearm safe storage device expenses for a taxable year. Limits the aggregate amount of expenses paid by an individual which may be treated as qualified firearm safe storage device expenses for any taxable year to the excess (if any) of $250 over the aggregate amounts treated as qualified firearm safe storage device expenses with respect to such individual for all prior taxable years. Title III: Handgun Child Safety Locks - Prohibits the manufacture of a handgun in the United States unless a child safety lock (i.e., a lock which, while activated or attached, prevents the firearm from being discharged) is attached to, or is an integral part of, the firearm. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to impose a civil fine of $5,000 on any person who violates such prohibition. Sets forth provisions regarding judicial review and inapplicability of this prohibition to governmental entities within the United States. Title IV: Child Firearm Access Prevention - Amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to subject any person who keeps a loaded firearm, or an unloaded firearm and ammunition, within any premise under such person's control and who knows, or reasonably should know, that a juvenile is capable of gaining access to the firearm without the permission of the parent or legal guardian, to one year's imprisonment and a $10,000 fine if a juvenile obtains access and causes death or bodily injury or illegally exhibits the firearm in a public place or school zone. Directs the Secretary to ensure that a copy of such prohibition appears on the form required to be obtained by a licensed dealer from a prospective transferee of a firearm."
