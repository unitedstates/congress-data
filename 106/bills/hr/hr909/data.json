Requires a State's application for such a grant to contain: (1) a description of a proposed plan for the development and implementation of a Y2K compliance program; and (2) a description or identification of a proposed funding source for the completion of the plan and maintenance of the system. Requires a State awarded a grant to expend one dollar for every two dollars awarded under the grant for the development and implementation of the compliance program. Permits the Secretary to waive or modify such matching requirement for any State that the Secretary determines would suffer undue hardship. Prohibits the award of a grant for a period of more than two years. Requires: (1) each State awarded a grant to submit an annual report that contains a description of the ongoing results of the evaluation of the plan for the compliance program funded under the grant; and (2) the Secretary to submit to the Congress a final report evaluating the programs funded under such grants. Authorizes appropriations."
