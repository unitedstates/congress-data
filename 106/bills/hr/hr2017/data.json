Directs the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce, as appropriate, acting through the Fish and Wildlife Service, any other Federal land management agency, the National Marine Fisheries Service, or a State conservation agency, to relocate from the flood control levee any threatened or endangered species of plant or animal that would be taken in the course of the agency action. Bars the Secretary from requiring a non-Federal person to carry out any measures to minimize or mitigate impacts of agency flood control actions, except as provided above."
