    "text": "OSHA Reform Act of 1999 - Amends the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA) to repeal provisions for: (1) inspections, investigations, and recordkeeping; (2) citations; (3) enforcement procedures; (4) judicial review; and (5) civil and criminal penalties. (Sec. 3) Requires a continuing comprehensive economic analysis of the costs and benefits of each OSHA standard. Directs the Secretary of Labor to consider the number of workers exposed to the toxic material or harmful physical agent, the nature and severity of the potential impairment, and the likelihood of such impairment, in determining the priority for establishing standards dealing with such materials or agents. (Sec. 4) Declares that employee safety and health participation committees are not prohibited under the National Labor Relations Act or the Railway Labor Act. Establishes a small business assistance and training program, including: (1) technical assistance and consultative services for employers and employees, targeted at small businesses and the most hazardous industries; and (2) certain consultative services to employers provided under cooperative agreements between the States and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Requires that at least one-fourth of the annual appropriation to carry out OSHA be expended for such assistance and training program. Directs the Secretary of Labor periodically to make an award to companies and other organizations which have implemented particularly effective approaches to occupational safety and health, including those providing for effective employee involvement."
