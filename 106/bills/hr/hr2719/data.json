Requires each LEA to ensure, in programs supported with part A funds, that: (1) all new teachers either are certified in the field in which they will teach or have a bachelors degree and are enrolled in a program through which they will obtain such certification within three years; and (2) all paraprofessionals meet specified educational requirements and perform only certain duties.(Sec. 117) Authorizes an LEA to use part A funds to provide certain preschool services: (1) directly to eligible preschool children in all or part of its jurisdiction; (2) through any school participating in the LEA's part A program; or (3) through a contract with a local Head Start agency, a partnership operating an Even Start program, a State-funded preschool program, or a comparable public early-childhood development program. Allows such preschool programs to be operated and funded jointly with Even Start programs (under ESEA title I part B), Head Start programs, or State-funded preschool programs.
