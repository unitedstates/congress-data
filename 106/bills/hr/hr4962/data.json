Prohibits employers from excluding from plans such individuals who work full-time, on an indefinite long-term basis, by miscategorizing them as temporary workers. Prohibits any such exclusion based on certain purported categorizations. Makes waivers of plan participation ineffective if related to such miscategorization of employees. Requires objective eligibility criteria in plan instruments. Sets forth enforcement procedures to provide relief to employees who have been miscategorized in violation of this Act."
