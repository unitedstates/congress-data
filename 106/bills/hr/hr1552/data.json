Sets forth procedures for such audit.Authorizes appropriations for the NOAA for FY 2000 and 2001 for oceanographic and marine research activities required to carry out facilities maintenance and repairs and environmental compliance.Requires the NOAA Administrator to make available through the NOAA Internet home page the abstracts relating to all research grants and awards made with funds authorized by this Act.Requires a specified amount out of funds received by the United States in settlement of damage claims arising from the 1992 collision of the vessel ZACHARY into the NOAA research vessel DISCOVERER to be retained as an offsetting collection in the NOAA Operations, Research and Facilities account and made available only for NOAA marine services.Abolishes the position of Chief Scientist of NOAA. Deems any reference to the Chief Scientist in Federal law, Executive orders, regulations, or documents to be to the NOAA Administrator."
