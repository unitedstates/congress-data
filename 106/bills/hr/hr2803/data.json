(Sec. 4) Includes as a Settlement Trust any trust operated for the benefit of shareholders (current law), Natives, and descendants of Natives. (Sec. 5) Includes within lands authorized to be allotted to Alaska Native veterans: (1) lands in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska which the eligible person used and occupied; and (2) land that was not vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved when the eligible person first used and occupied such land, but which later became vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved during the time the eligible person used and occupied the land. Makes eligible for such allotments Alaska veterans who served during the period between August 5, 1964, and May 7, 1975 (currently, the period between January 1, 1969, and December 31, 1971) and served on active duty for at least six months. Outlines allotment approval procedures, including the right to protest a proposed allotment.

Subjects any such conveyance to valid existing rights and certain reserved easements. States that conveyance of selected lands shall constitute full satisfaction of Corporation claims to replacement lands. (Sec. 9) States that no person acquiring a land interest under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act shall be liable for costs of removal or remedial action, any damages, or any third party liability arising out of any contamination on that land at the time the land was acquired unless such person was directly responsible for such contamination."
