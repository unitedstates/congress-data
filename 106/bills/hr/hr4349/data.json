    "text": "Bilingual Education and Technological Advancement Act of 2000 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make competitive grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to provide financial assistance to elementary and secondary schools for obtaining computer software for bilingual education. Requires preference for grant awards to be given to LEAs that serve an elementary or secondary school in which: (1) a majority of the students are from families with incomes below the poverty line; or (2) there is a high concentration of students with low levels of English proficiency. Allows grants to be used to assist schools which meet such poverty or low English proficiency criteria. Requires the Secretary to study and report to Congress annually on the effectiveness of such grants program. Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 3) Authorizes the Secretary to make competitive grants to LEAs to provide financial assistance to elementary and secondary schools for obtaining computers. Requires such grants to be awarded to any applicant LEA that serves elementary or secondary schools in which, cumulatively, a majority of the students are from families with incomes below the poverty line.Allows grants to be used only to assist schools in which: (1) a majority of students meet such poverty criteria; or (2) there are fewer computers than the greater of six or the number established by the Secretary for that type of school. Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 4) Authorizes the Secretary, jointly with the Secretary of Labor, to make matching grants for: (1) information technology training programs for former participants in such programs who have not received information technology certification, minorities, women, older individuals, veterans, Native Americans, and dislocated workers; and (2) bilingual education programs. Requires a partnership, to be eligible for such a grant, to consist of: (1) an institution of higher education; and (2) a private organization, such as a certified commercial information technology training provider or an information technology trade or professional association. Sets the Federal share of program cost at 50 percent. Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 5) Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to LEAs to assist them in awarding bonuses to teachers who achieve information technology certification. Limits the amount of such a grant to not more than $5,000 times the number of teachers described in the application. Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 6) Authorizes the Secretary to make competitive grants to institutions of higher education to provide scholarships to students who: (1) are preparing to enter the teaching profession; and (2) meet criteria established by the Secretary that requires them to obtain both technological and bilingual education.
