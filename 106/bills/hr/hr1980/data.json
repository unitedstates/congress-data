    "text": "Workplace Fairness Act of 1999 - Prohibits employment discrimination on any basis other than job performance by covered entities, including entities covered under specified employment discrimination prohibitions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as employing authorities to which specified provisions of the Government Employee Rights Act of 1991 or the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 apply. Grants specified powers to administer and enforce this Act to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Librarian of Congress, the Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance (for the Congress), the Attorney General, and Federal courts. Prohibits quotas. Declares that this Act does not apply to religious organizations (except in their for-profit activities). Disallows State immunity. Makes the United States liable for all remedies (except punitive damages) to the same extent as a private person. Allows recovery of attorney's fees. Requires posting notices for employees and applicants. Sets forth factors that pertain to job performance, including: (1) ability and willingness to comply with performance requirements (including attendance and procedures); (2) any use of a drug or of alcohol that may adversely affect job performance; (3) any conviction of an offense for which a term of imprisonment exceeding one year could have been imposed; and (4) the ability to work well with others."
