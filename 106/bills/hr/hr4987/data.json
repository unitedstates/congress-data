    "text": "Digital Privacy Act of 2000 - Amends the Federal criminal code to require, within 30 days after the expiration, extension, or denial of a court order approving a disclosure of stored electronic communications, the issuing or denying judge to report to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts regarding such order.Requires the Attorney General to report annually to Congress on the number and kind of warrants and subpoenas applied for by law enforcement agencies of the Department of Justice under provisions governing Government access to stored wire and electronic communications and transactional records.(Sec. 3) Extends the prohibition against the use as evidence of intercepted wire or oral communications to intercepted electronic communication.(Sec. 4) Revises provisions regarding the issuance of an order for a pen register or a trap and trace device to direct the court to issue such an order if factual evidence reasonably indicates that a crime has been, is being, or will be committed and information likely to be obtained is relevant to an investigation of that crime.(Sec. 5) Extends the protection of a warrant requirement to electronic communications stored by electronic communications services for one year or less.(Sec. 6) Permits: (1) a governmental entity to require disclosure by a provider of mobile electronic information generated by and disclosing the current physical location of a subscriber's equipment only if such entity obtains a court order issued upon a finding that there is probable cause to believe that the equipment has been used, is being used, or is about to be used to commit a felony offense; or (2) a provider of mobile electronic communication service to provide to a governmental entity such information with the consent of the subscriber or the user of the equipment concerned."
