Requires each entity collecting from or assessing amounts from an individual with an authorization in effect to provide the individual with a statement that the individual may at any time revoke the authorization.Amends FECA to: (1) prohibit an authorized committee of a candidate for Federal office from accepting any contribution from an authorized committee of another candidate for Federal office except with regard to the transfer of funds between an authorized committee of a candidate for Federal office and an authorized committee of the same candidate for another Federal office; and (2) require the FEC to obtain and provide for the computer software required to carry out electronic filings under FECA."
