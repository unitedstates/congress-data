Provides that such discharges and those regulated as being associated with industrial activity or with significant violation of a water quality standard or significant contributions of pollutants shall not include stormwater discharges associated with: (1) a construction activity that disturbs no more than five acres of land; or (2) a routine maintenance activity associated with a road, street, or vegetated road ditch or drainage way."
