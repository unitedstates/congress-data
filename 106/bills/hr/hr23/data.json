Requires an applicant LEA, to be eligible for such a grant, to demonstrate that it has developed the following initiatives: (1) a charter school program to allow parents greater choice in selecting the appropriate educational setting for their child; (2) a parental school choice program that allows parents the ability to select a public school located within the LEA; (3) a vocational and academic opportunities program that allows parents to choose a vocational or college preparatory program for their secondary school student child; (4) an early elementary reading program to ensure that all students can read by the third grade; (5) a program to provide a safe and drug-free environment at school; (6) a locally-developed standardized testing program; (7) curriculum development panels composed of teachers and parents; (8) a program to improve or increase the standards for teachers; (9) a merit pay system to reward teachers who meet or exceed performance criteria; and (10) a teaching excellence program to ensure that the most qualified teachers are hired, including teachers with expertise in the workplace. Sets forth a formula for allocation of funds to LEAS that meet such eligibility criteria. Authorizes appropriations."
