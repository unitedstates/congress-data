    "text": "Recruiting, Retention, and Reservist Promotion Act of 2000 - Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 to require an authorized per diem allowance for members who are deployed 251 days or more out of the preceding 365 days to take effect on the first day of the month after enactment of this Act (currently, October 1, 2001.) Makes eligible for such allowance members of the Coast Guard when not operating as a service of the Navy.Directs the Secretary of Defense to study and report to Congress on the extent to which such allowance is being paid to regular and reserve personnel, its effect on morale and retention rates, and the feasibility of establishing a reduced eligibility threshold for members of National Guard and reserve units serving on active duty of more than 30 days. Authorizes the Secretary, after such study, to reduce the threshold below 251 days (requiring congressional notification of any such change).Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the possibility of tax credits or small business loan incentives for businesses that employ National Guard and reserve personnel.Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the feasibility and desirability of expanding the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps of each military department, the Civil Air Patrol, the Naval Sea Cadet Corps, and the Young Marines."
