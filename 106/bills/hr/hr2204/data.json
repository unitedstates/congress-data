Mandates: (1) quarterly reports to congressional committees regarding the amount of securities offerings by foreign governments; and (2) prompt notification to the SEC of information indicating noncompliance with the securities laws. Requires each Federal banking agency and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to report annually to certain congressional committee on the number of foreign banks and extent of United States pension fund assets, respectively, that are operating in the United States and that the agency believes to be controlled by a foreign government. Instructs the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) enter into negotiations to conclude agreements with other nations allied with the United States to institute in those nations reporting requirements similar to those imposed by this Act; and (2) report to Congress on the progress of such negotiations."
