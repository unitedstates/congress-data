Authorizes additional appropriations for FY 2002 through 2006 for expansion and modernization, and for FY 2002 and 2003 for operations.(Sec. 205) Requires the NSF Director to establish the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation that will upgrade, link, and integrate a system of geographically distributed experimental facilities for earthquake engineering testing of full-sized structures and their components and partial-scale physical models. Authorizes appropriations for FY 2001 through 2004.(Sec. 207) Requires the FEMA Director to report to the Congress on elements of the earthquake hazards reduction program that specifically address the needs of at-risk populations, including the elderly, persons with disabilities, non-English-speaking families, single-parent households, and the poor.
