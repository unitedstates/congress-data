    "text": "Amends Federal aviation law to require the Secretary of Transportation to investigate and hold a public hearing with respect to each petition by the sponsor of a commercial service airport (or by the attorney general of a State on behalf of one or more persons, including governmental entities, with respect to an airport) claiming that fares for air transportation at an airport are unreasonably high, or that competition between air carriers at the airport is inadequate. Directs the Secretary to: (1) issue written findings in response to the issues raised in the petition; and (2) report to Congress the results of the investigations, if any. Directs the Secretary to review the marketing practices of air carriers that may inhibit the availability of quality, affordable air transportation services to commercial service airports. Requires the Secretary, if it is determined that one or more marketing practices of air carriers inhibit such services, to issue regulations addressing such practices."
