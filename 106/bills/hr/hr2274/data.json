    "text": "Directs the Secretary of Transportation to transfer ten percent of a State's apportionment of certain highway funds for a fiscal year to the State's apportionment for highway safety programs to be used for alcohol-impaired driving countermeasures, especially for individuals under age 21, if a State has not enacted or is not enforcing a law requiring the revocation or suspension of the driver's license of any such individual who is convicted of driving while under the influence of alcohol. Requires that such suspension or revocation to be until the individual's 21st birthday. Prohibits the transfer of a State's apportionment if the State allows an individual convicted while driving under the influence of alcohol to drive, during the period of revocation or suspension of the individual's driver's license in accordance with this Act, only for the purposes of going to and from such individual's place of employment or to and from a college or other institution of higher education or a trade school."
