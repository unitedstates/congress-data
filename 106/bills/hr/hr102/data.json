(Sec. 3) Authorizes the Center to award grants to grassroots organizations to develop youth intervention models in the following cities: (1) Washington, D.C.; (2) Detroit, Michigan; (3) Hartford, Connecticut; (4) Indianapolis, Indiana; (5) Chicago (and surrounding metropolitan area), Illinois; (6) San Antonio, Texas; (7) Dallas, Texas; and (8) Los Angeles, California. (Sec. 4) Requires eligible grassroots entities to: (1) be not-for-profit community organizations with demonstrated effectiveness in mediating and addressing youth violence by empowering at-risk youth to become agents of peace and community restoration; and (2) submit grant applications to the Center to fund intervention models that establish violence-free zones. Requires the Center to consider the grassroots entity's: (1) track record (and that of its key participating individuals) in youth group mediation and crime prevention; (2) engagement and participation with other local organizations; and (3) ability to enter into partnerships with local housing authorities, law enforcement agencies, and other public entities. (Sec. 5) Authorizes use of grant funds for youth mediation, youth mentoring, life skills training, job creation and entrepreneurship, organizational development and training, development of long-term intervention plans, collaboration with law enforcement, comprehensive support services and local agency partnerships, and activities to further community objectives in reducing youth crime and violence. Directs the Center to identify local lead grassroots entities in each designated city which include: (1) the Alliance of Concerned Men of Washington in the District of Columbia; (2) the Hartford Youth Peace Initiative in Hartford, Connecticut; (3) the Family Help-Line in Los Angeles, California; (4) the Victory Fellowship in San Antonio, Texas; and (5) similar grassroots entities in other designated cities. Requires the Center, in cooperation with the Attorney General, also to provide technical assistance for startup projects in other cities. (Sec. 6) Directs the Center to evaluate and report to the Attorney General on the effectiveness of grassroots agencies and other public entities involved in such demonstration project. (Sec. 8) Authorizes appropriations."
