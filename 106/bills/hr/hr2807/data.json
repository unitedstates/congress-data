Makes such waiver applicable with respect to the agency from which the information would be obtained only if the State and the agency so elect.(Sec. 3) Amends CNA provisions for the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children (WIC program) to direct the Secretary of Agriculture (the Secretary) to establish a demonstration project, in not more than 40 local agencies in not fewer than two States, under which costs of nutrition services and administration (under the WIC program) shall include the costs of identification of children eligible for benefits under, and enrollment of children in, State plans for Medicaid and SCHIP. Directs the Comptroller General to evaluate for Congress the costs associated with implementing such project, including Federal and State costs per child enrolled in such State plans.(Sec. 3(sic)) Amends NSLA to direct the Secretary to make grants to States to carry out State plans to involve eligible entities in the identification of children eligible for benefits under, and enrollment of children in, State plans for Medicaid and SCHIP. Provides that the following are eligible entities: (1) a school or school food authority participating in the school lunch program under NSLA; (2) an institution participating in the child and adult care food program under NSLA; (3) a local agency participating in the WIC program under CNA; or (4) any other nongovernmental social service provider. Includes the WIC demonstration project established under this Act among authorized uses of such grant funds. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to provide a specified amount of funds to the Secretary for each of FY 2000 through 2003. Entitles and directs the Secretary to accept such funds, without further Act of appropriation."
