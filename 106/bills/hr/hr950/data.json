    "text": "Beaches Environmental Assessment, Closure, and Health Act of 1999 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require States to adopt water quality criteria for coastal recreation waters consistent with criteria published by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under such Act.Directs the Administrator to conduct studies for use in developing: (1) a more complete list of potential health risks from inhalation, ingestion, or body contact, including effects to the upper respiratory system; (2) appropriate and effective indicators and appropriate, accurate, and expeditious methods for detecting the presence of pathogens in coastal recreational waters; and (3) guidance for State-to-State application of the revised water quality criteria for pathogens required to be issued by the Administrator under this Act that accounts for the diversity of geographic and aquatic conditions nationwide. Directs the Administrator to publish and revise regulations requiring monitoring of, and specifying methods to be used by States to monitor, coastal recreation waters at public beaches for compliance with water quality criteria and protection of public safety. Requires notification of local governments, the public, and the Administrator of exceedances, or the likelihood of exceedances, of water quality criteria for such waters.Requires the Administrator to issue guidance establishing core performance measures for testing, monitoring, and notification programs and for the delegation of such programs to local government authorities. Makes State resources available to such authorities if the programs are so delegated.Directs the Administrator to: (1) provide technical assistance to States for the implementation of uniform assessment and monitoring procedures for floatable materials in such waters; (2) specify the conditions under which the presence of floatable material constitutes a threat to public health and safety; and (3) establish a national coastal recreation water pollution occurrence database and a listing of communities complying with the monitoring and notification regulations published pursuant to this Act.Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to States to fulfill requirements under this Act.Authorizes appropriations."
