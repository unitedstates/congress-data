Provides for: (1) public comment; and (2) review by the Secretary respecting such action's anticompetitive effects.(Sec. 4) Subjects such actions to specified enforcement provisions of the Clayton Act.(Sec. 5) Directs the Attorney General to establish in the Department of Justice an Office of Special Counsel for Agriculture to handle agricultural antitrust issues.(Sec. 6) Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study respecting whether: (1) the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyard Administration needs additional resources to monitor and investigate the competitive implications of meat packing industry practices; and (2) disparities exist in the Administration's authority respecting the poultry, meat, and pork industries."
