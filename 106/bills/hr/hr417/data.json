Defines the term \"express advocacy.\"(Sec. 201) Redefines the term \"expenditure\" to include a payment made by a political committee for a communication that refers to a clearly identified candidate and is for the purpose of influencing a Federal election (regardless of whether the communication is express advocacy).(Sec. 202) Provides that in determining whether any broadcast communication constitutes express advocacy for purposes of this Act, there shall not be taken into account any background music not including lyrics.(Sec. 203) Prohibits the Federal Election (Commission) from entering into a conciliation agreement if it determines that there is probable cause to believe that a person has made a knowing and willful violation involving the reporting of an independent expenditure. Permits the Commission, when it makes such a determination, to institute a civil action for relief.(Sec. 204) Sets forth reporting requirements for certain independent expenditures made by persons (including political committees) aggregating: (1) $1,000 or more after the 20th day before an election; and (2) $10,000 or more up to or on the 20th day before an election. Requires additional reports to be filed each time such independent expenditures are made. Requires such reports to: (1) be filed with the Commission; and (2) contain the information required for a person who receives any disbursement in excess of $200 in connection with an independent expenditure, including the name of each candidate to whom an expenditure is intended to support or oppose.(Sec. 205) Prohibits a committee of a political party, on or after the date on which the political party nominates a candidate, from making both coordinated and independent expenditures to the candidate during the election cycle.Requires a political party committee, before making a coordinated expenditure to a candidate, to certify to the Commission that it has not and shall not make any independent expenditure to the candidate during the same election cycle. Prohibits a political party committee that submits a certification with respect to a candidate from transferring any funds to, assigning authority to make coordinated expenditures to, or receiving a transfer of funds from, a political committee of the party that has made or intends, during the same election cycle, to make an independent expenditure to the candidate.(Sec. 206) Redefines the term \"contribution\" to include coordinated activity which is defined as anything of value provided by a person in coordination with a candidate or other specified parties, for the purpose of influencing a Federal election, regardless of whether the value being provided is a communication that is express advocacy, in which such candidate seeks nomination or election to Federal office. Considers a coordinated activity as a contribution to the candidate, and in the case of a limitation on expenditures, treats it as an expenditure by the candidate.Redefines the term \"contribution or expenditure\" with respect to contributions or expenditures by national banks, corporations, and labor organizations, to include a contribution or expenditure as defined under FECA.Title III: Disclosure - Amends FECA to replace provisions permitting the filing of reports electronically with provisions requiring the Commission to: (1) promulgate a regulation for the filing of reports using computers and faxes; (2) make electronically filed reports publicly accessible on the Internet within 24 hours after their receipt by it; and (3) provide methods (other than requiring a signature on the filing) for verifying covered reports.(Sec. 302) Prohibits the deposit (except in escrow accounts) or negotiation of contributions from a person making aggregate contributions in excess of $200 during a year by a candidate's authorized committee unless the required contributor information is complete.(Sec. 303) Permits the Commission to conduct random audits and investigations to ensure voluntary FECA compliance. Extends from six to 12 months the period during which campaign audits may be begun.(Sec. 304) Revises reporting requirements for identification of other than political committee contributors to: (1) lower the $200 threshold for the reporting of contributor identification to $50; and (2) require only the names and addresses of persons who make contributions of between $50 and $200 per year.(Sec. 305) Revises requirements for use of candidates' names.(Sec. 306) Prohibits a person from soliciting contributions by falsely representing himself or herself to be a candidate or a representative of a candidate, a political committee, or a political party.(Sec. 307) Requires filing of a certain statement with the Commission by persons, other than political committees of political parties and religious and apostolic organizations, that make aggregate disbursements in excess of $50,000 per year for specified Federal election activities: (1) on a monthly basis; or (2) within 24 hours, in the case of disbursements made within 20 days of an election.
