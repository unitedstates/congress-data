Outlines Chugach application requirements for the withdrawn lands and requires lands previously selected by Chugach for such purposes to be evaluated for their eligibility as cemetery sites and historical places. Provides a reinstatement period for Chugach to refile an application for lands previously requested.Title III: Forest System Land Management - Directs the Secretary to coordinate the development, maintenance, and revision of land and resource management plans for units of the National Forest System in Alaska with the plans of the Alaska Native Corporations for the utilization of lands which are intermingled with, adjacent to, or dependent for access upon National Forest System lands."
