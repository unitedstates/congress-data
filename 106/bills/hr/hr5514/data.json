Deems unsafe any seafood containing methyl mercury over the tolerance limits.Requires the Secretary to: (1) ensure that such tolerance is safe and to modify or revoke any tolerance found to be unsafe; and (2) ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to pregnant women, infants, and children from aggregate exposure to methyl mercury.Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a system for the ongoing collection and analysis of seafood samples to determine the extent of tolerance compliance; (2) design and implement a national public education program regarding the presence of methyl mercury in seafood; (3) work with States and other appropriate entities to develop national and regional methyl mercury advisories; (4) consider, when determining such tolerance, certain findings of the National Academy of Sciences regarding the Environmental Protection Agency's recommended level for methyl mercury; and (5) report to Congress on progress made in establishing the tolerance."
