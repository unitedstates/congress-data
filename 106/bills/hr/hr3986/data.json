Requires the Secretary, in coordination with the Kennewick Irrigation District and in consultation with the Bonneville Power Administration, to: (1) prepare a report that describes project benefits and contains feasibility level designs and cost estimates; (2) secure the critical right-of-way areas for the pipeline alignment; (3) prepare an environmental assessment; and (4) conduct such other studies or investigations as are necessary to develop a water exchange. Requires that the rate to be utilized by the Administrator of the Administration in determining the cost of power needed for the electrification or water exchange be the rate prescribed under current law or the equivalent of such rate."
