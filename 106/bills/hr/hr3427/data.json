Requires such report to include (among other things): (1) specific actions taken by the U.S. chief of mission in the country to which a child is alleged to have been abducted; (2) a list of countries party to the Convention in which parents who have been left-behind in the United States have not been able to secure prompt enforcement of a final return or access order under a Hague proceeding, of a U.S. custody, access, or visitation order, or of an access or visitation order in the country concerned, due to the absence of an effective method for enforcement of civil court orders, the absence of comity, or other factors; and (3) a description of the Secretary's efforts to encourage the parties to the Convention to facilitate the work of nongovernmental organizations within their countries that assist parents seeking the return of children under the Convention.(Sec. 203) Directs the Secretary to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the investigation into the March 30, 1997, grenade attack in Cambodia.(Sec. 204) Prohibits the State Department from obligating more funds than expressly authorized and appropriated (or obligating such funds unless the appropriate congressional committees are notified) for a U.S. pavilion or other major exhibit at any international exposition or world's fair registered by the Bureau of International Expositions.(Sec. 205) Amends the Inspector General Act of 1978 to declare that the Inspector General of the Agency of International Development (AID) shall serve as the Inspector General of the Inter-American Foundation and the African Development Foundation.(Sec. 206) Directs the Secretary to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the extent of international drug trafficking through Cuba since 1990.(Sec. 207) Amends the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution to require the President to report to Congress at least once every 90 days (currently, 60 days) on the status of efforts to obtain Iraq's compliance with resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council in response to Iraq's aggression.(Sec. 208) Amends the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to require the Director General of the Foreign Service to report to specified congressional committees summarizing the number of Foreign Service positions in each overseas mission requiring foreign language competence that became vacant during the previous year and were filled by individuals having the required foreign language competence.(Sec. 209) Extends certain reporting requirements.(Sec. 210) Authorizes interest accrued on certain joint funds under agreements for cooperation in environmental, scientific, cultural and related areas to be used by the State Department without return to the Treasury and without further appropriation by Congress.(Sec. 211) Directs the Secretary to: (1) review extradition treaties and other agreements containing extradition obligations to which the United States is a party; and (2) report to the appropriate congressional committees regarding U.S. extradition policy.Subtitle B: Consular Authorities - Amends the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 with respect to fees charged for processing machine readable nonimmigrant visas and machine readable combined border crossing identification cards and nonimmigrant visas.
