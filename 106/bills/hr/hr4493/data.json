Directs the court to order that substance abuse treatment be provided in the locality in which the individual resides.(Sec. 204) Requires the Bureau of Prisons to maintain a drug dependency program for offenders sentenced to incarceration, which shall consist of residential substance abuse treatment and aftercare services. Sets forth reporting requirements.(Sec. 206) Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to submit a report to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees regarding mandatory minimum sentences for controlled substance offenses, which shall include an analysis of: (1) whether such sentences may have a disproportionate impact on ethnic or racial groups; (2) the effectiveness of such sentences in reducing drug-related crime by violent offenders; and (3) the frequency and appropriateness of the use of such sentences for nonviolent offenders in contrast with other approaches such as drug treatment programs."
