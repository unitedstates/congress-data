Makes it unlawful for any person to import or manufacture a handgun unless the weapon: (1) cannot be fired with the average hand and finger strength of a four year old child; (2) cannot be fired without an ammunition magazine or clip attached; (3) has a locking feature that cannot be removed without making the weapon inoperable; or (4) has a mechanism that visibly and noticeably indicates whether ammunition is present in the weapon. Mandates, for knowing violations: (1) fines or imprisonment (or both); and (2) revocation of a license to import, manufacture, or deal in firearms or import or manufacture ammunition."
