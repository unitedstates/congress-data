    "text": "Veterans Sexual Trauma Treatment Act - Makes permanent a program to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide counseling to veterans to overcome psychological trauma which resulted from a physical assault or battery of a sexual nature, or from sexual harassment, which occurred during active miliary service (under current law the program authorizing such counseling expires in 2001). Allows such program to include appropriate treatment. Requires a Department of Veterans Affairs mental health professional (currently, the Secretary) to determine when such counseling and treatment is necessary. Requires the dissemination of information concerning the availability of such services to affected veterans. Includes as eligible for such care and services certain current and former reserve personnel. Directs the Secretary to: (1) complete the design and updating of public service announcements and other appropriate means of communication concerning the availability of such services and to submit to the congressional veterans' committees examples of such communications; and (2) report to such committees on program implementation. Requires the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense to report jointly to the congressional veterans' and defense committees describing their collaborative efforts to ensure that military personnel are informed upon their separation from service about sexual trauma counseling and treatment programs available through the Department."
