Requires OPIC in conjunction with each Board of Directors' meeting to hold a public hearing in order to afford an opportunity for any person to present views regarding OPIC activities.(Sec. 4) Revises the composition of the OPIC Board of Directors.(Sec. 5) Revises the purposes of the Trade and Development Agency to include, with respect to the promotion of U.S. private sector participation in development projects in developing and middle-income countries, special emphasis on economic sectors with significant U.S. export potential, such as energy, transportation, telecommunications, and environment. Directs the Agency to require corporations and other entities to: (1) share the costs of feasibility studies and other project planning services; and (2) reimburse the Agency those funds it has provided, if the corporation or entity concerned succeeds in project implementation. Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 6) Requires the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) to: (1) report on actions taken to eliminate the areas of overlap and duplication identified among Federal export promotion activities; (2) coordinate efforts to sponsor or promote any trade show or trade fair; (3) work with all relevant State and national organizations, including the National Governors' Association, that have established trade promotion offices; and (4) report to Congress on actions taken to promote better coordination among State, Federal, and private sector export promotion activities.(Sec. 7) Amends the Export Enhancement Act of 1988 to change the deadline for TPCC annual reports from September 30 to March 30."
