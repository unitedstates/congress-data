    "text": "National Parks Air Tour Management Act of 1999 - Amends Federal aviation law to prohibit a commercial air tour operator from conducting commercial air tour operations over a national park or tribal lands, except in accordance with this Act, conditions prescribed for that operator by the FAA Administrator, and any commercial air tour management plan for the park. Sets forth specified requirements with respect to: (1) the granting of authority to commercial air tour operators to conduct air tour operations over national parks or tribal lands, with specified exceptions; (2) establishment of commercial air tour management plans; and (3) determinations of whether a flight is a commercial air tour operation. Exempts from the requirements of this Act: (1) the Grand Canyon National Park, or any tribal lands within or abutting such park; (2) any land or waters located in Alaska; and (3) the Lake Mead National Recreation Area (but solely as a transportation route for an air tour of the Grand Canyon). Applies this Act to the Grand Canyon if specified other Federal law mandating an air traffic management plan for the air space above the Canyon is no longer in effect. Directs the FAA Administrator and the Director of the National Park Service (Director) to establish, jointly, an advisory group to provide continuing advice and counsel with respect to the operation of commercial air tours over and near national parks. Directs the FAA Administrator to report to Congress on the effects proposed overflight fees are likely to have on the commercial air tour industry. Directs the FAA Administrator and the Director to report jointly to Congress on the effectiveness of this Act in providing incentives for the development and use of quiet aircraft technology. Requires any methodology adopted by a Federal agency to assess air tour noise in any unit of the national park system (including the Grand Canyon and Alaska) to be based on reasonable scientific methods."
