Requires the transfer to the Fund of that portion of each of the following trust funds that is not required to meet current withdrawals: the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund; the Department of Defense Military Retirement Fund; the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund; the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund; the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund; the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund; and the Railroad Retirement Account. Directs the Retirement Trust Fund Investment Board to establish for the Fund a Common Stock Index Investment Fund for the investment of Fund assets. Requires an annual examination and report by a qualified public accountant of Fund books and records. Provides fiduciary responsibilities. Establishes the Retirement Trust Fund Investment Board as an independent agency, with an Executive Director chosen by Board members. Requires the Executive Director to report to each House of Congress and specified congressional committees on the state of the Fund. Prohibits Fund receipts and disbursements from being counted as new budget authority for purposes of the Federal budget, the congressional budget, or the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act). Provides special reporting requirements for the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget with respect to Fund assets."
