Requires such programs to use a voucher system under which a vehicle owner may use a voucher (equal to the reimbursement rate per vehicle under the State's contract with a vendor) to: (1) have a vehicle inspected by the State's chosen vendor; or (2) defray part of the cost of an inspection by a licensed private concern."
