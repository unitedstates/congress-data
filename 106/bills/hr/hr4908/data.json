Provides an exception where the employer has reasonable grounds to believe that an employee is engaged in conduct that violates the legal rights of, or involves significant harm to, the employer or another person.Requires an employer: (1) after first providing notice of such electronic monitoring, to provide annual notice to all employees who are subject to such monitoring; and (2) before implementing a material change in such an electronic monitoring practice, to provide notice to all employees who are subject to such monitoring as a result of the change.Allows any person aggrieved by any act in violation of this Act to bring an action in a U.S. district court. Sets limits on monetary damages awarded."
