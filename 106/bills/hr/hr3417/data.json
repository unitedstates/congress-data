Allows resource grants to be used to pay a State's share of costs required under any other Federal program that is consistent with the purposes of this paragraph. Allows a State to allocate (in addition to currently-authorized recipients) to any reserve in the National Estuarine Research Reserve System a portion of any resource grant to carry out the purpose of this paragraph.
