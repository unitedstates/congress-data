Requires any exclusion from a pension plan to be made on a uniform basis, stated in the plan, and based on reasonable job classifications and objective criteria. Prohibits excluding workers from a pension plan for an indefinite period of time: (1) beyond a year of service; or (2) by designating the worker as part-time employee, temporary employee, leased employee, agency employee, or staffing firm employee, where the worker is an employee of the employer under the common law and has served the plan's minimum service period. Requires every plan instrument to contain eligibility criteria which complies with such requirements and prohibitions with respect to exclusions."
