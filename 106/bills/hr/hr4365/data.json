Authorizes such agreement to provide $500,000, on a reimbursable basis, for such activities. Authorizes appropriations.Subtitle C: Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000 - Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000 - Amends the Federal judicial code to direct the United States Sentencing Commission to amend the sentencing guidelines regarding any offense relating to the manufacture, importation, or exportation of, or trafficking in, 3,4-methylenedioxy methamphetamine, (MDMA, or Ecstasy), paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMA), or any other controlled substance that is marketed as Ecstasy and that has either a chemical structure substantially similar to, or an effect on the central nervous system substantially similar to or greater than that of, MDMA (including an attempt or conspiracy to commit such an offense in violation of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, or the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act).Directs the Commission: (1) with respect to each such offense, to review and amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to provide for increased penalties that reflect the seriousness of those offenses and the need to deter them; and (2) to ensure that the Federal sentencing guidelines for offenders convicted of such offenses reflect the need for aggressive law enforcement action regarding offenses involving such controlled substances and the dangers associated with unlawful activity involving such substances.Expresses the sense of Congress that (1) the base offense levels for Ecstasy are too low and should be increased; and (2) the base offense levels for importing and trafficking the controlled substances described in the first paragraph should be increased.(Sec. 3664) Directs the Commission to promulgate amendments under this subtitle as soon as practicable after this subtitle's enactment in accordance with a procedure set forth in the Sentencing Act of 1987 (emergency guidelines promulgation authority) as though the authority under that Act had not expired.(Sec. 3665) Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to make grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements for: (1) school-based programs concerning the dangers of abuse of and addiction to MDMA, related drugs, and other drugs commonly referred to as \"club drugs\"; and (2) community-based abuse and addiction prevention programs relating to MDMA, related drugs, and other club drugs.
