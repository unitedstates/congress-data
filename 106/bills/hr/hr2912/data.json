Repeals the expiration of additional Federal funds for such Medicaid-eligibility determinations (thus making such provisions permanent and such additional Federal funds available on a fiscal year basis). Includes as administrative expenditures those attributable to the administrative costs of eligibility determinations under SSA title XXI (Children's Health Insurance) (CHIP) with regard to children and pregnant women and outreach to such populations likely to be eligible for such benefits."
