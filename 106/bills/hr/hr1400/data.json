Directs the SEC, when determining such actions to consider private sector collection and distribution systems for transaction information on corporate debt securities. Modifies securities' registration requirements to provide that: (1) a registration is not required to be effective for exchange trading of a class of debt securities of an issuer that has another class of securities for which a registration is effective for such exchange; and (2) such class of debt securities shall be treated as registered upon approval of its listing by the exchange. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on investor protection measures needed to improve information dissemination and transparency concerning transactions in: (1) debt securities as to which transaction information is collected but not disseminated pursuant to the Act; and (2) municipal securities."
