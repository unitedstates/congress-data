    "text": "TV Consumer Freedom Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit any cable system or other multichannel video programming distributor from retransmitting the signal of a broadcasting station, or any part thereof, without the express authority of that station. Directs the Federal Communications Commission to commence a rulemaking proceeding to revise regulations governing the exercise by broadcast stations of the right to grant such consent. Repeals Federal provisions requiring cable operators to carry the signals of local commercial television stations and qualified noncommercial educational television stations."
