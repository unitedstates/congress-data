Requires a Federal law enforcement impact statement, for each provision of that measure that would increase the law enforcement responsibility of the Government, to contain the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the Commission as to the extent to which: (1) that increase in responsibilities would occur only as to core Federal responsibilities; (2) the efforts of States are inadequate to address the purposes to be served by that provision; and (3) the burdens imposed on the Federal court system with respect to that provision could be accommodated within the existing capacity, resources, and structure of that system."
