    "text": "Airline Competition Preservation Act of 2000 - Amends Federal transportation law to authorize the Secretary of Transportation, on his or her own initiative or on a complaint, to: (1) investigate to determine whether an air carrier is charging a fare or an average fare for interstate air transportation on a route that is unreasonably high; and (2) upon an affirmative finding, order the carrier to reduce the fare, offer the reduced fare for a specific number of seats on the route, and offer rebates to individuals who have been charged the fare.Provides for a situation where, with respect to an interstate route to or from a hub airport, a dominant air carrier (which accounts for more than 50 percent of total annual boardings) at the airport: (1) institutes or changes its fares in a manner that results in fares lower than or comparable to those offered by a new entrant air carrier; and (2) increases the passenger capacity at which such fares are offered to a level which is two or more times the capacity previously offered by the carrier at such fares on the route, and two or more times the total capacity offered by the new entrant air carrier on the route. Requires the dominant air carrier in such a situation, in the two-year period beginning when such fares and additional capacity are instituted, to continue to offer such fares with respect to at least 80 percent of the highest number of seats per week for which the dominant air carrier has offered them.Authorizes the Secretary, on his or her own initiative or on a complaint, to: (1) investigate to determine whether a dominant air carrier at a hub airport is charging higher than average fares at the airport; and (2) upon an affirmative finding, order the carrier to take specified actions to increase opportunities for competition at the hub airport.Makes this Act effective immediately upon the Secretary's determination that three or fewer air carriers account for 70 percent or more of the scheduled revenue passenger miles in interstate air transportation as a result of specified consolidations, mergers, or acquisitions."
