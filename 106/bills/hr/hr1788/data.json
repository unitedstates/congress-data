    "text": "Nazi Benefits Termination Act of 1999 - Denies Federal public benefits to individuals who have been participants in Nazi persecution. Authorizes the Attorney General, if an individual who has applied for or is receiving a Federal public benefit may have been such a participant, to provide an opportunity for a hearing on the record with respect to the matter. Allows the Attorney General to delegate the conduct of the hearing to an immigration judge.Describes hearing procedures under this Act. Requires an immigration judge who finds that the respondent has been a participant in Nazi persecution to: (1) promptly issue an order declaring the respondent to be ineligible for any Federal public benefit and prohibiting any person from providing such a benefit to the respondent; and (2) transmit a copy of the order to any governmental entity or person known to be so providing such a benefit and to any governmental entity or person known to have received an application for benefits that has not been finally adjudicated.Authorizes the Attorney General to review any finding or conclusion made, or order issued and to initiate any review within 30 days. Requires any order, finding, or conclusion to be final: (1) 30 days after it is issued if the Attorney General does not initiate such a review; or (2) either upon the issuance of a decision by the Attorney General or 90 days after the order, finding, or conclusion is issued, whichever is earlier, if the Attorney General does initiate a review.Allows any party aggrieved by a final order issued under this Act to obtain judicial review of the order by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit by filing a petition for such review no later than 30 days after the final order becomes final, or completion of any review by the Attorney General, whichever is later."
