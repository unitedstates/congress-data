Requires an agency publishing a final major rule to prepare and place in the rule making file a final regulatory impact analysis which shall reflect any changes made to the proposed rule or its cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment, as well as agency consideration of comments from interested parties as provided above.Mandates a comparative risk study by the Director of the extent and severity of significant risks to human health, safety, or the environment.
