Removes provisions prohibiting an examination of a bank, savings association, or credit union regarding compliance with the Act. Removes provisions empowering the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to issue interpretations of the Act regarding: (1) certain domestic (and branches and agencies of foreign) banks, certain commercial lending companies, savings associations, and certain other financial institutions; and (2) Federal credit unions. Requires: (1) certain Federal banking agencies to jointly prescribe regulations for such banks and financial institutions; and (2) the Administrator of the National Credit Union Administration to prescribe regulations for Federal credit unions."
