Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to direct the U.S. Executive Directors at specified international financial institutions to use the U.S. vote at each institution to oppose the provision of assistance for any project in Pakistan, until the President makes such certification. Authorizes the President to waive the requirements in this Act if it is in the national security interests of the United States."
