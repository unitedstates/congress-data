Prohibits in any event the amount determined under clause (2) from exceeding 200 percent of the amount determined under clause (3). Permits an alternative computation.Defines \"foreign trading gross receipts\" as the gross receipts of the taxpayer which are: (1) from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of qualifying foreign trade property; (2) from the lease or rental of qualifying foreign trade property for use by the lessee outside the United States; (3) for services which are related and subsidiary to either any sale, exchange, or other disposition of qualifying foreign trade property by such taxpayer, or any lease or rental of qualifying foreign trade property described in clause (2) by such taxpayer; (4) for engineering or architectural services for construction projects located (or proposed for location) outside the United States; or (5) for the performance of managerial services for a person other than a related person in furtherance of the production of foreign trading gross receipts described in clause (1), (2), or (3). Prohibits clause (5) from applying to a taxpayer for any taxable year unless at least 50 percent of its foreign trading gross receipts (determined without regard to this sentence) for such taxable year is derived from activities described in clause (1), (2), or (3).
