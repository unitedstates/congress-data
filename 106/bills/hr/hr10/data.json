(Sec. 102) Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHCA) to exempt from its prohibition against interests in nonbanking organizations the shares of any company whose activities had been determined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board), as of the day before the date of enactment of this Act, to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. (Sec. 103) Creates a statutory mechanism for the establishment of financial holding companies (FHCs) whose subsidiary depository institutions are well-capitalized and well-managed and meet other specified criteria. Instructs the Board to establish and apply comparable capital standards to a foreign bank with a subsidiary bank or commercial lending company in the United States. Permits an FHC to engage in any activity and acquire the shares of any company whose activities have been determined by the Board to be either financial in nature, or incidental to financial activities. Mandates consultation and coordination, between the Board and the Secretary of the Treasury (the Secretary) regarding determination of whether an activity is financial in nature, or incidental to financial activities. Includes among such activities any investments, lending, insurance, securities transactions, certain financial operations abroad, and ownership or control of banking interests. Mandates notification to the Board of certain large business combinations with FHCs. Requires an FHC to make assurances that risk management procedures adequately protect insured depository institution subsidiaries, including reasonable measures to preserve separate corporate identity and limited liability. Cites circumstances under which an FHC (and its foreign counterpart) may engage in nonfinancial activities. Permits FHCs which were not BHCs or foreign banks before becoming FHCs to retain limited non-financial activities and affiliations. Sets forth cross-marketing restrictions for FHC-controlled depository institutions. Requires the Board, when considering an FHC acquisition, merger, or consolidation, to consider the extent to which its subsequent failure or default after consummation could have serious adverse economic effects, or trigger financial instability (\"too big to fail\" factor). (Sec. 104) Preempts State anti-affiliation laws restricting transactions among insured depository institutions, wholesale financial institutions, insurance concerns, and national banks. Cites exceptions to such preemption, especially for State regulation of the business of insurance, including the retention of State capitalization requirements for an insurance entity acquired by another entity. Declares that this Act shall not affect State antitrust and general corporate law. Retains State oversight authority over specified financial activities other than insurance. Prohibits State regulation of the insurance activities of an insured depository institution or wholesale financial institution in any way that discriminates adversely between insured depository institutions or wholesale financial institutions and other entities engaged in insurance activities. (Sec. 105) Requires that mutual bank holding companies be regulated on the same terms as bank holding companies. (Sec. 105A) Amends the following banking acts to mandate public meetings concerning proposed large bank mergers and acquisitions: (1) BHCA of 1956; (2) the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA); (3) National Bank Consolidation and Merger Act; and (4) the Home Owners' Loan Act. (Sec. 106) Amends the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (RNIBBEA) to apply its prohibition against deposit production offices to interstate branches acquired or established under this Act, including all branches of a bank owned by an out-of-State BHC. (Sec. 107) Amends the FDIA to apply to any branch of a bank controlled by an out-of-State BHC certain requirements for branch closures by an interstate bank. (Sec. 108) Authorizes well-capitalized and well-managed limited purpose banks to engage in any banking activity. (Maintains the restriction that such banks may accept demand deposits or make commercial loans, but not both.) Prohibits such banks from permitting any overdraft (including intraday overdrafts), or incurring overdrafts in their accounts at a Federal Reserve Bank, on behalf of an affiliate, with certain exceptions. Permits such banks to: (1) issue corporate credit cards; (2) cross market affiliates; and (3) avoid divestiture by correcting violations within six months of receiving notice from the Board. (Sec. 109) Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the projected impact that enactment of this Act will have upon: (1) financial institutions with total assets of $100 million or less; and (2) upon insurance agents and consumers. (Sec. 110) Instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to study and report to Congress on the extent to which: (1) adequate services are being provided as intended by the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA), as a result of enactment of this Act (including services in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and for persons of modest means); and (2) credit is being provided to small businesses and farms as a result of this Act. Subtitle B: Streamlining Supervision of Financial Holding Companies - Amends the BHCA of 1956 to prohibit the Board from imposing any capital or capital adequacy criteria upon a non-depository institution FHC subsidiary that is: (1) in compliance with State or Federal capitalization rules; (2) registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; and (3) duly licensed under State law. Prohibits the Board, in developing holding company capital adequacy requirements, from taking into consideration any affiliated investment company which is not a bank holding company (BHC) nor controlled by one holding 25 percent or more shares of the investment company worth more than $1 million. (Sec. 111) Authorizes the Board to transfer its BHC oversight authority to the appropriate Federal banking agency if a BHC is not significantly engaged in non-banking activities. Mandates Board deference to the SEC and relevant State securities and insurance authorities with respect to interpretations and enforcement of activities within their respective jurisdictions (functional regulation). (Sec. 112) Provides that a declaration filed by a company seeking to be an FHC shall satisfy BHC registration requirements but not any requirement to file an application to acquire a bank. Revises BHCA divestiture procedures to permit a BHC to elect divestiture of either a nonbanking subsidiary or an insured depository institution. (Sec. 113) Amends the BHCA and the FDIA, respectively, to declare ineffective and non-enforceable any Board or Federal banking agency action that requires an insurance company BHC, a registered securities broker-dealer BHC, or a bank subsidiary to provide assets to a subsidiary insured depository institution if the State insurance authority, or the SEC, determines in writing that such actions would have a material adverse effect on the BHC's financial condition. Permits the Board to order divestiture of the subsidiary in lieu of other action. (Sec. 114) Sets forth prudential safeguards criteria under which the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), are authorized to restrict the relationships or transactions between entities and subsidiaries under their respective jurisdictions.
