Provides mandatory retirement for such technicians who continue employment as a non-dual status technician. States that a technician shall be considered to lose dual status upon: (1) being separated from the Selected Reserve; or (2) ceasing to hold the military grade specified for the technician position held. Provides separation and retirement requirements identical to those above for non-dual status National Guard technicians."
