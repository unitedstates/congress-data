    "text": "Noncommercial Broadcasting Freedom of Expression Act of 2000 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to allow a nonprofit organization to hold a noncommercial educational (NCE) radio or television license if the station is used primarily to broadcast material that such organization or entity determines serves an educational, instructional, cultural, or religious purpose in that community, unless such determination is arbitrary or unreasonable.Prohibits the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from: (1) imposing or enforcing any quantitative requirement on NCE licenses based on the number of hours of programming that serve such purposes; or (2) imposing or enforcing any other programming content requirement on an NCE license that is not imposed on a licensee, permittee, or applicant for a commercial radio or television license. Specifies that NCE licensees remain subject to applicable provisions of the Children's Television Act and the requirements of the Public Broadcasting Act.Exempts NCE stations from requirements to make broadcast stations accessible to political candidates and directs the FCC to amend its rules governing political broadcasting to provide that such rules do not apply to NCE stations.Requires each public telecommunications entity that receives funds from donors to undergo an annual audit (current law) which shall include a determination of such entity's compliance with donor privacy protection requirements.Prohibits the FCC from establishing, expanding, or otherwise modifying requirements relating to the service obligations of noncommercial educational radio or television stations except by means of agency rulemaking."
