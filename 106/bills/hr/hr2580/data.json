    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Land Recycling Title II: Expenditures From the Hazardous Substance Superfund Title III: Liability Reform Title IV: Public Health Land Recycling Act of 1999 - Title I: Land Recycling - Prohibits, with exceptions, the President and any person other than a State from using specified authorities of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or the Solid Waste Disposal Act to commence an administrative or judicial action with respect to a release or threatened release at a facility that is, or has been, the subject of a response action pursuant to a State program submitted to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) together with a certification by the State that: (1) the State has enacted such program into law and committed the necessary financial and personnel resources to carry out the program; and (2) such program will be implemented in a manner protective of human health and the environment and includes meaningful opportunities for public participation.Provides that no Federal permit or permit revision shall be required for the on-site portion of response actions subject to such prohibition.Requires the Administrator to provide assistance to States for establishing such programs.(Sec.103) Amends CERCLA to permit the President to add a facility to the National Priorities List (NPL) only with the concurrence of the Governor of the State in which the facility is located. Authorizes the President, notwithstanding such condition, to add a facility to the NPL if: (1) the release or threatened release affects public health or the environment in more than one State, unless the Governors of each such State fail to concur, upon presidential request, in the listing of the site; or (2) the State where the facility is located is a major potentially responsible party (PRP) at the facility.(Sec. 104) Amends CERCLA, with respect to defenses to liability of an owner of after-acquired property, to deem a person to have made (under current law, \"undertaken\") appropriate inquiry into the property's previous ownership and uses if the person establishes that an environmental site assessment was conducted which meets specified requirements (compliance with an American Society for Testing and Materials standard or with standards issued by the Administrator) and the person fulfills certain responsibilities concerning information compilation.(Sec. 105) Absolves from liability for response actions bona fide prospective purchasers to the extent liability at a facility for a release or threat thereof is based solely on ownership or operation of a facility. Gives a lien upon a facility to the United States for unrecovered response costs in any case in which there are such unrecovered costs for which the owner is not liable by reason of this section and the facility's fair market value has increased above that which existed six months before the action was taken.(Sec. 106) Absolves of liability for response costs and damages certain owners or operators that are State or local governments that acquired property involuntarily, or through eminent domain or the granting of a license or permit to conduct business, if such governments: (1) acquired the affected facility after the disposal or placement of the hazardous substances for which liability is alleged; (2) did not cause or contribute to the hazardous substance release; and (3) exercised appropriate care with respect to such substances.(Sec. 107) Exempts from liability certain owners or operators of real property contiguous to property on which there has been a release or threat thereof. Authorizes the President to grant such persons an assurance of no enforcement action and protection against cost recovery and contribution actions.(Sec. 108) Revises provisions regarding the degree of cleanup for hazardous substances that will remain on-site to provide that remedial actions for such substances shall require a level or standard of control which achieves Maximum Contaminant Levels (currently, Maximum Contaminant Level Goals) under the Safe Drinking Water Act where such levels are appropriate under the circumstances of the release considering the timing of any anticipated use of water as drinking water and reasonable points of compliance.
