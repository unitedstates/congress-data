    "text": "Federal Information Policy Act of 2000 - Amends Federal law to revise provisions regarding Federal information policy.

Requires annual submissions of agency evaluations to the Officer, Director, and Congress.Establishes a Chief Information Officers Council in the executive branch to assist and advise in, and carry out other related activities with respect to, Federal information resource management.Requires the Officer to report annually to Congress on: (1) efforts undertaken to improve the development, application, and management of information resources; and (2) results of major activities undertaken by the Council.Authorizes appropriations to carry out Federal information policy provisions for FY 2001 through 2005.(Sec. 4) Incorporates provisions similar to those under existing law with respect to paperwork reduction.Requires the Director to extend the annual Governmentwide goal for the reduction of information collection burdens by at least five percent through FY 2005.Requires the Director to encourage the use of the Government Information Locator Service to provide information regarding agency information collection activities and opportunities to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of agency collections of information and the reduction of paperwork burdens on the public.Authorizes appropriations to carry out paperwork reduction activities for FY 2001 through 2005.(Sec. 5) Establishes an Office of Information Security and Technical Protection in the Office of Information Policy (established by this Act).Requires the Officer to establish Government-wide policies for the management of programs that: (1) support the cost-effective security of Federal information systems by promoting security as an integral component of each agency's business operations; and (2) include information technology architectures(integrated frameworks for evolving or maintaining existing information technology and acquiring new technology to achieve strategic goals and information resources management goals). Requires such policies to: (1) be founded on a continuous risk management cycle; (2) implement controls that adequately address the risk; (3) promote continuing awareness of information security risks; (4) continually monitor and evaluate information security policy; and (5) control effectiveness of information security practices. Outlines information security responsibilities of each agency, including the development and implementation of an agency-wide security program for the operations and assets of such agency. Makes each program subject to Officer approval and annual review by agency program officials.Requires each agency to annually undergo an independent evaluation of its information security program and practices. Requires related reports.Authorizes appropriations for FY 2001 through 2005 to carry out information security provisions.(Sec. 6) Requires the: (1) Secretary of Commerce to develop, issue, review, and update standards and guidance for the security of Federal information systems; (2) Secretary of Defense and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to develop and issue more stringent information security policies for mission critical systems of such entities and ensure the implementation of such policies; (3) Department of Justice to review and update guidance to agencies on legal remedies regarding security incidents and coordination with law enforcement agencies concerning such incidents; (4) General Services Administration to review and update guidance on addressing security considerations relating to the acquisition of information technology; and (5) Office of Personnel Management to review and update regulations concerning computer security training for Federal civilian employees.Allows mission critical information security policies developed by the Department of Defense, CIA, and other agencies to be adopted by the Officer and heads of other Federal agencies with respect to mission critical systems of such agencies. Allows agencies to develop and implement more stringent information security policies than those required under this Act.(Sec. 7) Incorporates provisions of the Clinger-Cohen Act with respect to management of information technology.
