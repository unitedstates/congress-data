Requires the Governor of each State to designate State agencies that conduct, supervise, and coordinate audits, civil and criminal investigations, inspections, and evaluations. Authorizes each Governor to establish and maintain a State agency to act as a Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Unit. Establishes: (1) the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account in the Treasury; and (2) the Account Payments Advisory Board to make recommendations to the IGs regarding the equitable allocation of payments from the Account."
