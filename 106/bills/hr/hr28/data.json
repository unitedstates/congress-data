    "text": "Quality Child Care for Federal Employees Act - Directs the Administrator of General Services to: (1) establish health, safety, and facility standards and compliance requirements for child care in executive branch facilities;(2) issue regulations requiring any entity sponsoring a child care center to comply with certain accreditation standards; and (3) establish an interagency council to facilitate cooperation and sharing of best practices. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 4) Amends Federal law to revise conditions for the allotment of space for child care services for Federal employees in Federal buildings. Makes available child care and related services to children of Federal employees or on-site Federal contractors, or dependent children who live with such employees or contractors. (Currently space may be allotted for the provision of child care services to children of whom at least 50 percent have one parent or guardian who is a Federal employee.) Declares that the Administrator of General Services must confirm that at least 50 percent of aggregate enrollment in Federal child care centers governmentwide are children of Federal employees or on-site Federal contractors, or dependent children who live with such employees or contractors. States that, if enrollment at a center drops below the goal, the provider shall develop and implement a business plan with the sponsoring Federal agency to achieve the goal within a reasonable time frame. Authorizes an agency without a child care program, or the Administrator upon identifying a need for child care at a Federal agency, to enter into an agreement with an existing non-Federal, licensed, and accredited child care facility, or a planned facility that will become licensed and accredited. Permits an agency, upon the approval of the agency head, to conduct a pilot project for up to two years to test innovative approaches to providing more cost-effective alternative forms of child care assistance for Federal employees. Requires the Administrator to serve as an information clearinghouse for such pilot projects initiated by other agencies. Requires all existing and newly hired workers in any child care center located in federally owned or leased facilities to undergo a criminal history background check. Directs each agency head to require that each child care facility the agency first operates, or contracts for, at least one year after enactment of this Act provide reasonable accommodations for the needs of breast fed infants and their mothers."
