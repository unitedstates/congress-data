Provides that: (1) such provisions apply to any HEAL program loan to graduate students made by an eligible lender and insured by the Secretary of Health and Human Services on or after November 13, 1998; and (2) the HEAL program provisions superseded by NEPIA, as in effect on November 12, 1998, apply to a HEAL loan made by an eligible lender and insured by the Secretary before November 13, 1998."
