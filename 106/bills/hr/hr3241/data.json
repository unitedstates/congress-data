Prohibits previous judicial decisions regarding the fee dispute from being introduced in evidence or considered by the arbitrator.Requires the arbitrator to award Fort Sumter Tours, Inc. reasonable attorney's fees and costs for all proceedings involving the disputed franchise fee if it is the prevailing party in arbitration.Prohibits the Secretary, until arbitration is completed and no longer subject to appeal, from soliciting or accepting a bid for any contract for passenger service to the National Monument. Requires the Secretary, during such time frame, to offer annual extensions of the concessions contract to Fort Sumter Tours, Inc."
