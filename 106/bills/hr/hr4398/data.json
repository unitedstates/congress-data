    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Energy Employees' Beryllium Compensation Title II: Nuclear Employees' Radiation Compensation Title III: Employees Exposed to Toxic Substances and Heavy Metals Title IV: Economic Development Assistance Energy Employees Occupational Illness and Compensation Act of 2000 - Finds that civilian men and women who performed duties in the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons production program over the last 50 years should have efficient, uniform, and adequate compensation for beryllium-related health conditions and radiation-related health conditions in order to assure fairness and equity.Title I: Energy Employees' Beryllium Compensation - Directs the Secretary of Energy to enter into an agreement with the Secretary of Labor to administer this title and for compensation by the Department of Energy for that administration from the Energy Employees Beryllium Compensation Fund (established by this title).Defines \"covered employee\" to be any employee of any entity that contracted or subcontracted with the Department of Energy to provide services relating to uranium conversion or manufacturing, a beryllium vendor's employee while the entity conducted activities related to beryllium produced or processed for the Department of Energy, who may have been exposed to beryllium, or a resident of Lorain County, Ohio (before 1950 in the area near the Brush Beryllium Company) who has been diagnosed with a covered illness. Provides compensation to such persons.Allows covered employees exposed to beryllium and diagnosed with beryllium-related pulmonary conditions to elect to receive alternative compensation of $200,000. Extends such option to the employee's survivors.Title II: Nuclear Employees' Radiation Compensation - Establishes a similar program and a Nuclear Employees' Radiation Compensation Fund to compensate covered employees for disability or death, medical services, and vocational rehabilitation for certain illnesses attributable to occupational exposure to radiation and other hazardous substances, including leukemia, cancer, and chronic renal disease. Provides for a similar alternative compensation of $200,000.Title III: Employees Exposed to Toxic Substances and Heavy Metals - Allows claims for compensation for illnesses, impairments, diseases, or death for which the claimant can establish that exposure to a hazardous substance occurred while a covered employee at a Department of Energy facility and that such exposure was a contributing factor to the illness, disease, or death. Provides for the establishment of physicians panels for claims evaluations.Title IV: Economic Development Assistance - Amends the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 to make areas that contain a Department of Energy defense nuclear facility, as defined by specified provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, eligible for assistance under existing provisions relating to: (1) grants for public works and economic development; and (2) grants for economic adjustment."
