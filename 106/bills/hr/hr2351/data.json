Shields such consumer from liability for the amount of any negotiable instrument sent in violation of this Act. Prohibits the reporting to, or receipt by, any credit agency of information on consumer creditworthiness based upon such unsolicited loan checks. Requires the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate implementing regulations."
