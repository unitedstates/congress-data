    "text": "Declares that, by one year after enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall no longer administer the National Forest System using the organizational structure of Forest Service regions. Directs the Secretary, by that time, to eliminate the ten existing regional offices of the Forest Service and replace them with State offices.Directs the Secretary to establish a State office of the Forest Service in each State containing any portion of the National Forest System. Authorizes establishment of a Forest Service office to serve more than one State, or consolidate separate offices previously established, if: (1) the total acreage of System lands in a particular State does not justify a separate Forest Service office for that State; and (2) the System lands in that State can be readily managed through a Forest Service office in another State.Authorizes the Secretary to establish up to six technical support centers, which must be at the same location as a State office."
