    "text": "Digital Bridge Trust Fund Act - Amends the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act to establish in the Treasury the Digital Bridge Trust Fund. Appropriates to the Fund 100 percent of the amounts received by the Treasury after FY 2000 as taxes on communications required under the Internal Revenue Code.Establishes in the Department of Commerce the Board of Trustees of the Digital Bridge Trust Fund to make decisions with respect to allocations authorized under this Act. Requires the Board to submit annual reports to the President and Congress regarding its activities.Requires the Board to ensure that assistance provided herein is: (1) made available for the benefit of rural and urban areas and Native Americans in a manner that targets such assistance for areas, communities, and populations that are underserved with respect to information technology needs, employment, and education; and (2) appropriately allocated. Directs the Board to make such assistance available for FY 2001 through 2010 for: (1) teacher training; (2) community technology centers; (3) neighborhood network learning centers; (4) the Technology Development Fund; (5) the Technology Opportunity Program; (6) rural, urban, and Native American technology training; (7) broadband network deployment; (8) the Home Internet Access Program; and (9) the Falling Through the Net survey (to determine the extent to which Americans have access to telephones, computers, and the Internet). Allows excess amounts to be allocated at the Board's discretion. Authorizes the Board, in any of fiscal years 2006 through 2010, to reduce the amounts of assistance provided during the first five years.Authorizes appropriations for FY 2001 through 2010. Repeals this Act on October 1, 2010.Amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce from 3 to 1.5 percent, as of October 1, 2000, the excise tax on telephone and other communications services. Expresses the sense of Congress that providers of communications services should not increase service rates based upon such reduction."
