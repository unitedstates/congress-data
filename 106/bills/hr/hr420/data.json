Includes information on sequestration to reduce the public debt in reports issued by the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office. Applies this Act's amendments, beginning in FY 1999, and ceases its effectiveness after the earlier of: (1) the first fiscal year during which there is no public debt; or (2) the fiscal year during which there is enacted legislation which is determined, under Government budgeting and scoring principles, to keep social security solvent."
