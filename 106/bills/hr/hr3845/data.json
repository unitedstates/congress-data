Makes an identical revision with respect to the fee charged for securities issued after September 30, 2000, by participating companies for small business loans guaranteed by the SBA.Authorizes small businesses which are limited partnerships or subchapter S corporations to make quarterly distributions at any time during a calendar quarter (currently, only at the end of a calendar quarter)."
