    "text": "School Environment Protection Act of 1999 - Amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a National School Integrated Pest Management Advisory System to develop and update uniform standards and criteria for implementing integrated pest management systems in schools. Directs local educational agencies (LEAs) of school districts to develop and implement systems in schools in compliance with this Act. Permits LEAs to continue to implement existing State systems that meet this Act's standards and criteria.Applies this Act's requirements to pesticide application in school buildings and on school grounds. Requires schools to prohibit: (1) the application of a pesticide when a school or school ground is occupied or in use; or (2) the use of an area or room treated by a pesticide, other than a least toxic pesticide, during the 24-hour period beginning at the end of the treatment.Requires the Administrator to establish a National School Integrated Pest Management Advisory Board. Directs the Board, among other duties, to: (1) review pesticides used in schools for their acute toxicity and chronic effects; and (2) recommend a list of least toxic pesticides. Authorizes the Board to recommend restrictions on pesticide use in schools. Requires the Administrator to: (1) establish a list of least toxic pesticides that may be used in schools; (2) publish pesticide restrictions in the Federal Register; and (3) issue findings on whether use of registered pesticides in schools may endanger children's health.Directs the Administrator to appoint an official for school pest management within the EPA Office of Pesticide Programs to coordinate integrated pest management systems in schools. Requires LEAs to: (1) designate contact persons for carrying out such systems; (2) maintain all pesticide use data for each school in the district and make such data publicly available; and (3) include notice of such systems in forms of universal notification at the beginning of each school year. Permits the use of a pesticide only if the pesticide has been disclosed in such notice.Prescribes procedures to be followed if a pest cannot be controlled after having used an integrated pest management system and least toxic pesticides, including prior notification of parents, guardians, and staff members of the use of a pesticide and posting of signs. Prescribes alternative procedures in emergency situations.Provides for public comments, through school board meetings, on integrated pest management systems. Establishes a complaint procedure to remedy violations of this Act. Prescribes civil penalties for violations.Establishes the Integrated Pest Management Trust Fund to carry out education, training, propagation, and development activities under integrated pest management systems of schools to remedy the harmful effect of actions taken by persons who paid civil penalties. Describes remedies for employees alleging violations of this Act.Directs the Administrator to provide grants to LEAs to develop systems under this Act.Prohibits, no later than six years after this Act's enactment, the use of any pesticide other than a least toxic pesticide in schools unless the Administrator has met the requirements of this Act.Authorizes appropriations."
