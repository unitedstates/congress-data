Sets forth provisions regarding apportionment of funds. Directs that at least five percent of sums available to a State in a fiscal year be expended on education and awareness campaigns, and that at least ten percent be expended on projects for the elimination of railway-railway crossing hazards. Sets the Federal cost share at 80 percent. Amends the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century to exclude such funding from the obligation ceiling for Federal-aid highway and highway construction programs. (Sec. 3) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) transfer the excise taxes on fuel used in trains to the HTF beginning on October 1, 1999; and (2) terminate such excise taxes on October 1, 2004."
