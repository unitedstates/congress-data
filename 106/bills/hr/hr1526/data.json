    "text": "Commercial Space Competitiveness Act of 1999 - Amends the Commercial Space Launch Act to revise the definition of \"launch\" to delete provisions limiting the definition to activities involved in the preparation of a launch vehicle or payload for launch only when they take place at a launch site in the United States. Requires, in the scheduling of launches at a U.S. Government launch site, that private sector launches be provided the greatest possible access to launch opportunities at the earliest possible dates. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to facilitate and encourage the acquisition by the private sector and State governments of Federal property and services, including utilities, for the support of commercial space launch efforts. Requires, at least 30 days before any property is acquired, for the head of an agency from which the property is to be acquired to provide public notice of the proposed acquisition."
