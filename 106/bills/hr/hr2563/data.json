(Under current law, priority is given to costs associated with the Bridge, other than design costs.)Limits the total amount made available from the Highway Trust Fund for the Federal contribution to $1.5 billion and requires amounts from the Fund for the project in excess of such amount to be provided by the Capital Region jurisdictions (jurisdictions).Requires, for FY 2004 through 2007, that every one dollar provided from the Fund be matched by at least 67 cents provided by such jurisdictions. Requires such jurisdictions to allocate payment of the matching funds as they determine to be appropriate.Amends the Internal Revenue Code to make Fund amounts available for U.S. obligations incurred pursuant to such Act."
