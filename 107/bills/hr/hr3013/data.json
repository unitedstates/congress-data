    "text": "Port and Maritime Security Act of 2001 - Establishes a Port Security Task Force to advise the Secretary of Transportation with respect to coordinating programs to enhance the security and safety of U.S. seaports against crime and terrorism.Directs the Secretary to develop standards and procedures for conducting seaport vulnerability assessments.Directs the Secretary to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to prescribe regulations to protect the public from threats of crime or terrorism from or to vessels in maritime transportation originating or terminating in a U.S. seaport, as well as to maritime or intermodal infrastructure associated with coastal, intercoastal, and inland marine terminals. Requires each port authority and marine terminal operator, or other entity connected with maritime commerce, for which a port security vulnerability assessment has been done to establish, subject to approval of the Captain-of-the-Port, a maritime transportation security program. Directs the Secretary to initiate a rulemaking to establish a program under which a port authority or marine terminal operator may access the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System for employees first hired after implementation of such program who may have access to ocean manifests in the scope of their employment.Directs the Secretary to establish seaport security committees to: (1) review seaport security vulnerability assessments; and (2) conduct an exercise periodically to verify the effectiveness of each seaport authority and marine terminal security plan.Sets forth requirements calling for: (1) the development of voluntary security guidance to serve as a benchmark for the review of security plans; (2) the adoption of such guidance and development of seaport security standards by other countries; and (3) the development of standards for the training and certification of maritime security professionals.Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to authorize the Secretary to make loan guarantees and provide grants for seaport security infrastructure improvements for eligible U.S. seaports.Reauthorizes specified tonnage duties."
