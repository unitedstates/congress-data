Requires the Attorney General to respond to the inquiry of the State authorized agency within 15 business days.Authorizes the Attorney General and authorized State agencies to disseminate criminal history background check record information to a qualified entity. Sets fees collected by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for background checks.Directs the Attorney General to establish: (1) an Office for Volunteer and Provider Screening; and (2) a model program in each State and the District of Columbia to improve fingerprinting technology.Prohibits adjusting, deleting, or altering information derived from a national criminal fingerprint background check request except as required by law for national security purposes."
