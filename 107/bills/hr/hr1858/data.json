Allows grantees to provide room and board for participating teachers.Title IV: Robert Noyce Scholarship Program - Requires the Director to award competitive grants to institutions of higher education to provide scholarships, stipends, and programming designed to recruit and train mathematics and science teachers. Designates such grants program as the Robert Noyce Scholarship Program, and such grantee institutions as National Teacher Scholarship Centers. Provides for scholarships for certain students and stipends for certain professionals seeking teaching certification. Requires certain teaching service commitments from individuals who receive such scholarships or stipends. Directs grantee institutions to supply to the Director statistical and demographic data on scholarship recipients and stipend recipients, including information on required teaching employment. Requires the Director to report to Congress on the impact of the implementation of this title on drawing into teaching top mathematics and science students, including students from groups underrepresented in mathematics, science and engineering.Title V: Requirements for Research Centers - Requires the Director to ensure that any NSF program that awards grants for the establishment of research centers at institutions of higher education after the date of the enactment of this Act: (1) requires every center to offer programs for elementary and secondary mathematics and science teachers and students to increase their understanding of the field in which the center specializes; and (2) uses the quality of a center's proposed precollege education programs as a criterion in determining grant awards.Title VI: Educational Technologies Research - Subtitle A: Research Centers - Requires the Director to award competitive grants to institutions of higher education to establish centers to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of information technologies in elementary and secondary mathematics and science education.Subtitle B: Assistance - Amends the Scientific and Advanced Technology Act of 1992 to authorize the Director to award competitive grants to associate-degree granting colleges, bachelor-degree granting institutions, or education service agencies to establish centers to assist elementary and secondary schools in the use of information technology for mathematics, science, or technology instruction.Title VII: Miscellaneous Provisions - Requires the Director to award demonstration grants to eligible local educational agencies (LEAs) for mathematics and science proficiency partnerships.(Sec. 701) Allows grant funds to be used to: (1) provide teacher professional development in mathematics, science, or technology; (2) develop or implement mathematics, science, and information technology curricula, and purchase related equipment; and (3) carry out other activities the NSF Director determines would improve mathematics, science, or technology education. Requires LEA conditional agreements for private sector participation in such programs through: (1) donation of equipment; (2) establishment of mentoring and internship opportunities; and (3) donation of college scholarship funds for students who have participated. Requires special priority in awarding such grants to be given to eligible LEAs that demonstrate the greatest: (1) ability to obtain commitments from private sector representatives to provide such services and funds; and (2) economic need. Requires assessment, evaluation, and a report to Congress on such demonstration grants project.(Sec. 702) Requires the Director, in making awards for outreach grants (for articulation partnerships between community colleges and secondary schools) under the Scientific and Advanced-Technology Act of 1992, to give priority to proposals that involve secondary schools with a majority of students from groups that are underrepresented in the science, mathematics, and engineering workforce. Exempts awards in such cases from a matching contribution requirement.(Sec. 703) Requires the Director to review, and report to Congress on, all NSF-sponsored programs that support in-service teacher professional development for science teachers to determine: (1) the level of resources and degree of emphasis placed on training teachers in the effective use of information technology in the classroom; and (2) the allocation of resources between summer activities and follow-on reinforcement training and support to participating teachers during the school year.(Sec. 704) Requires the Director to study and report to Congress on broadband Internet access for schools and libraries."
