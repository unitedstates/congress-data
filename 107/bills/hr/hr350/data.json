Permits all such amounts to be made available for the acquisition of land or interests to be administered by the BLM.Requires annual budget requests to be accompanied by information as to whether BLM, through preparation of land use plans, has identified public lands, the transfer or disposal of which have been delayed because of incomplete surveys or other reasons, which are suitable for transfer to other management or for disposal through exchange or otherwise."
