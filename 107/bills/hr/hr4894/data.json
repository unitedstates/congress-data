Allows inclusions of sites otherwise excluded from consideration if: (1) financial assistance will protect human health and the environment, promote economic development or enable the creation of parks, greenways, or other property used for nonprofit purposes, or promote eco-industrial development; (2) they were contaminated by a controlled substance; (3) they are certain low-risk petroleum-contaminated sites; or (4) they are mine-scarred.Defines eco-industrial development as development conducted in a manner in which businesses cooperate with each other and the local community to share resources efficiently (such as information, materials, water, energy infrastructure, and natural habitat) with the goals of economic gains, improved environmental quality, and equitable enhancement of human resources in businesses and local communities."
