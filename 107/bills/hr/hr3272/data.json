    "text": "World Trade Center Attack Claims Act - Establishes within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) the Office of World Trade Center Attack Claims. Entitles persons (individuals and entities) who suffered injury as a result of the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, and who reside or maintain a place of business in the area south of Canal Street in Manhattan to Federal compensation. Requires the Director of FEMA (or an Independent Claims Manager if appointed to head such Office) to investigate and deny or pay (and determine appropriate amounts for) claims submitted for such compensation.Limits claim payments to: (1) the amount necessary to compensate for injuries suffered during the 18-month period following the attack; and (2) $500,000, with exceptions. Prescribes compensable residential losses and business losses. Requires the Director to reduce the amount to be paid for any claim by the amount of any insurance or other Federal assistance program payments as appropriate to prevent a claimant's recovery in excess of actual compensatory damages.Provides claimants the right to appeal payment decisions regarding residential losses to the Director or regarding business losses to the Administrator of the Small Business Administration.Declares that this Act shall not affect the rights of an injured person to request benefits under any Federal entitlement programs."
