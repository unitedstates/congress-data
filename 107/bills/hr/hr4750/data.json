Reserves for each designated wilderness area a quantity of water sufficient to fulfill the purposes of this Act and directs the Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture, as appropriate, and all other U.S. officers to protect such water rights.Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to amend the management plans for the Ventana and Silver Peak Wildernesses to authorize the Forest Supervisor of the Los Padres National Forest to take appropriate actions for fire prevention and watershed protection in such areas. Incorporates any special provisions in the management plan for such Wildernesses into the Los Padres National Forest management plan.Permits military flights and flight training over, and continued non-motorized access for military training in, such wilderness areas.Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a 5-year pilot program to eradicate invasive plant and animal species in the Monterey District of Los Padres National Forest. Permits program activities to include actions to address invasive species problems on nearby private land or other land that is not Forest Service property if: (1) the land owner or responsible government agency head seeks to participate in the program; and (2) the invasive species occurs on the land and poses a threat to national forest lands. Authorizes appropriations.Authorizes such Secretary to permit the construction and maintenance of a new water line and spring box improvements adjacent to an existing domestic water service in the Silver Peak Wilderness."
