    "text": "Ecstasy Prevention Act of 2001 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to give priority in the award of certain grants to States on a pass-through basis to communities that have taken measures to combat club drug use, including passing ordinances restricting rave clubs, increasing law enforcement on Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxy methamphetamine or MDMA), and seizing lands under nuisance abatement laws to make new restrictions on an establishment's use.Requires the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy to: (1) use amounts available under this Act to combat the trafficking of Ecstasy in designated high intensity drug trafficking areas; and (2) ensure that the national media campaign under the Drug-Free Media Campaign Act of 1998 addresses the reduction and prevention of abuse of Ecstasy and club and emerging drugs among young people in the United States.Provides for: (1) funding for an Ecstasy drug test which would meet Federal workplace standards; and (2) a mandatory research study by the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse that evaluates the effects that Ecstasy use can have on an individual's health.Requires the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy to establish an interagency Task Force on Ecstasy/MDMA and Emerging Club Drugs."
