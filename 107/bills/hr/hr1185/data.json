Includes among such developing countries any sub-Saharan African country five percent or more of whose population is infected with HIV, or whose government has declared a national emergency with respect to HIV/AIDS.Encourages such developing countries to implement policies designed to address the underlying causes of the HIV/AIDS crisis by making efforts to encourage practices that will prevent further transmission and infection and to stimulate development of the infrastructure necessary to deliver adequate health services, including policies that provide an incentive for public and private research on, and development of, vaccines and other medical innovations that will combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic, particularly in Africa."
