Authorizes Federal land managers (with the exception of National Park Service managers) to allow casual collecting of abundant invertebrate and plant paleontological resources for scientific, educational, and recreational uses without a permit where not inconsistent with laws governing management of such lands and this Act. Sets forth permit issuance criteria and requirements. Requires any paleontological resource and associated data and records collected under a permit to be deposited in an approved repository.Prohibits: (1) excavating, removing, or altering a paleontological resource located on Federal lands except in compliance with this Act; (2) exchanging or receiving such a resource that was obtained from Federal lands in violation of Federal law; (3) selling or purchasing a paleontological resource that was obtained from Federal lands; or (4) making or submitting false records, accounts, or identification of any such resources.Sets forth requirements for the assessment of civil penalties by Federal land managers for violations of any prohibitions contained in regulations or permits issued under this Act. Requires any recovered amounts to be available to such a manager for use: (1) to protect or restore the paleontological resources and sites or to acquire sites with equivalent resources and to protect, monitor, and study the resources and sites; (2) to provide educational materials to the public about paleontological resources and sites; and (3) as a reward.Requires that information on the nature and specific location of a paleontological resource that requires a permit under this Act or other Federal law be withheld from the public, including under the Freedom of Information Act, except under specified conditions."
