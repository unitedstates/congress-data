Requires that such study assess what effect the exemption has had on institutional undergraduate grant aid and parental contribution to undergraduate costs of attendance, including consideration of any changes in institutional undergraduate grant aid and parental contribution to undergraduate costs of attendance over time for institutions of higher education.Directs: (1) the Comptroller General to report to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees on its findings and conclusions without identifying an individual institution of higher education unless the information on the institution is publicly available; and (2) participating institutions to collect and maintain specified data and information (but does not require non-participating institutions of higher education to collect and maintain data)."
