Requires the Director to make grants for the establishment of not more than five such Centers to integrate the work of multidisciplinary teams of researchers, education practitioners, and policymakers to support the research priorities developed, and to facilitate the incorporation of research results into educational practice.Authorizes appropriations for NSF participation in the Interagency Education Research Initiative."
