Requires the Secretary to provide certain education-related grants under the Scientific and Advanced Technology Act of 1992, but authorizes funds only to support activities to improve education in CNS-related fields. Requires that CNS be included among the fields of specialization supported by NSF's Graduate Research Fellowships program under the National Science Foundation Act of 1950.(Sec. 7) Amends the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 to require the NSF to take a leading role in supporting research and education activities to improve networked information systems' security.(Sec. 8) Amends the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act (NISTA) to require the NIST Director, through the Director of the Office for Information Security Programs, to establish a program of assistance to IHEs that enter into partnerships with for-profit entities to support research to improve CNS. Authorizes the NIST Director to establish a program to award post-doctoral research fellowships, including senior fellowships, to individuals seeking research positions at institutions engaged in research activities related to CNS.
