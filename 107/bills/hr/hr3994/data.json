    "text": "Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 - Title I: Economic and Democratic Development Assistance for Afghanistan - Sets forth principles governing the provision of assistance for Afghanistan, including reducing terrorism and narcotics control, the participation of women, Afghan self-reliance, stability, and coordination of international donors.(Sec. 104) Authorizes the President to provide assistance for Afghanistan for the following activities: (1) urgent humanitarian needs; (2) repatriation and resettlement of refugees and internally displaced persons; (3) counternarcotics efforts; (4) reestablishment of food security, rehabilitation of the agriculture sector, improvement in health conditions, and the reconstruction of basic infrastructure; (5) reestablishment of Afghanistan as a viable nation-state through support for the development and expansion of democratic and market-based institutions; and (6) support for the establishment of a market economy, private financial institutions, the development of a telecommunications infrastructure, and trade and commercial links. Conditions certain assistance, initially, on the convention of a Loya Jirga (traditional Afghan assembly), and later, on substantial progress toward a constitution and democratically elected government, unless the President certifies to Congress that the vital national interests of the United States require otherwise.(Sec. 105) Earmarks funds for assistance in the major opium producing regions, including areas within the Badakshan, Helmand, and Qandahar provinces, with the goal of eliminating poppy cultivation. Denies such assistance to regions where the Afghan Government does not actively, effectively, and vigorously participate in illicit narcotics suppression activities or where production is more than de minimis, unless the President certifies to Congress that the vital national interests of the United States require otherwise.(Sec. 106) Urges the President to: (1) designate within the Department of State a coordinator (with the advice and consent of the Senate) to design an overall strategy for coordinating such assistance and advancing U.S. interests in Afghanistan; and (2) utilize the expertise of Afghan-Americans. Declares that the administrative provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 shall apply to the same extent as they apply to certain other economic assistance. Requires the Comptroller General and the Inspector General of the United States Agency for International Development to monitor and audit expenditures. Authorizes appropriations for FY 2002 through FY 2005.Title II: Military Assistance for Afghanistan and Certain Other Foreign Countries and International Organizations - Expresses the sense of Congress that, during the transition to broad-based, multi-ethnic, gender-sensitive fully representative government, the U.S. should support: (1) the development of a civilian-controlled and centrally-governed standing Afghanistan army that respects human rights; (2) the creation and training of a professional civilian police force that respects human rights; and (3) a multinational security force in Afghanistan.(Sec. 202) Authorizes the President to provide and direct the drawdown of defense articles and services and military education to the Government of Afghanistan. Permits the provision of counter-narcotics, crime control, police training services, and other specified support.(Sec. 203) Makes other foreign countries or international organizations eligible for such assistance if they are participating in certain military, peacekeeping, or policing operations in Afghanistan.(Sec. 204) Declares that such articles, services, and military education and training shall be made available to the Department of Defense without reimbursement except to the extent that funds are appropriated to the President for such purpose. Authorizes appropriations to the President of sums necessary to reimburse the applicable appropriation, fund, or account for such assistance.(Sec. 205) Authorizes the President to provide assistance under this title to an eligible foreign country or international organization notwithstanding any other provision of law upon notifying the appropriate congressional committees that to do so is important to the national security interest of the United States.(Sec. 206) Terminates authority under this title on December 31, 2004."
