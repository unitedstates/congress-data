    "text": "Expediting Project Delivery To Improve Transportation and the Environment Act - Designates the Federal Highway Administration (FHA), the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), or the two agencies jointly as the lead agency for the surface transportation process for preparing a detailed environmental impact statement, assessment, or other document under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 with respect to certain highway or transit projects eligible for Federal assistance from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). Lists lead agency responsibilities, including: (1) determining the purpose and need for the proposed action, the alternatives to be considered, and the appropriate methodologies for measuring transportation impacts; and (2) coordinating efforts to identify and resolve expeditiously issues that could cause other Federal agencies to oppose or deny project approval or delay process completion.Authorizes the Governor of a State to request the assistance of the Secretary of Transportation in resolving issues that could result in the denial of necessary permits or approvals or cause project delays.Prohibits the Secretary from approving a transportation project that has a significant impact on a protected resource, with exceptions.Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a survey biennially of State agencies participating in environmental assessments involving HTF funds; (2) establish a comprehensive program to stimulate the adoption of innovative methods for expediting and improving the environmental review process; (3) transfer to States certain Federal environmental responsibilities with respect to highway or transit projects; and (4) carry out a program to accelerate the procurement of large transit buses by transportation authorities that are recipients of financial assistance from FTA, with exceptions."
