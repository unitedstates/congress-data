Authorizes a State to make a facility of the reserves available for such purpose, with the same continuation or notification requirement.Amends the Revised Statutes to deem the use of military installations or reserve facilities for polling purposes to be consistent with Federal voting rights law. Requires an installation or facility that was made available for a Federal election during 1998 or 2000 to be made available for the general election for Federal office in November 2002."
