Sets forth program requirements, including: (1) establishment of a standard application form for all civilian schools giving such instruction; (2) maintenance of a database of all processed applications; (3) completion of a standard application by each applicant and a criminal background check; and (4) if a check reveals evidence of criminal, espionage, or terrorist activity or any other evidence that the Administrator determines to be a security threat, establishment of procedures to ensure the applicant does not receive training at such school. Requires the Administrator to establish reasonable fees (not to exceed $100 per individual) to pay expenses incurred in carrying out this Act.Requires the Director of the Office of Homeland Security to conduct a review of the current air carrier employee criminal background check procedures."
