Requires any person producing hardrock minerals from a mine within an unpatented mining claim or a mine on land that was patented under the general mining laws to pay into such fund a percentage-based reclamation fee. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to use the Fund for the reclamation and restoration affecting eligible areas.Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to issue an abandoned or inactive mined land waste remediation permit to a remediating party (the United States, States, local governments, or Indian tribes) for discharges associated with remediation activity at abandoned or inactive mined land under certain conditions.Authorizes and sets forth guidelines for issuance of permits by the Administrator and application requirements. Authorizes enforcement actions against parties who fail to comply with permit conditions.Makes remediation plans under permits issued under this Act eligible for nonpoint source management grants."
