Sets forth specified circumstances under which the President may waive one or more of such requirements.Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should instruct the U.S. Executive Director at each international financial institution to use the U.S. voice, vote, and influence to urge that the cancellation or reduction of debt owed to the institution by a country be provided only if it meets the additional requirements of this Act."
