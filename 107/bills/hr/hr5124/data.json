Sets forth notice and disclosure requirements.Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer the name and taxpayer identification number of individuals opting for organ donation to the Registry, exempting such disclosure from otherwise applicable prohibitions on the non-tax use of tax form information.Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to qualified organ procurement organizations to establish programs coordinating organ donation activities with hospitals to increase the rate of organ donation for such hospitals.Directs the Secretary to establish an interagency task force on organ donation and research.Requires the Secretary to: (1) award peer-reviewed grants for studies and demonstration projects to increase organ donation and recovery rates, including removing financial disincentives; (2) establish an organ donation public awareness program; (3) support model curricula in relevant issues; (4) develop scientific evidence to support increased donation and improve recovery, transportation, and preservation of organs and tissues; and (5) support research to develop a uniform vocabulary, apply information technology, and enhance the skills and technologies used in organ procurement."
