Defines the terms \"corporate insider\" and \"transfer-restricted 401(k) plan.\"Includes within the definition of the term \"disqualified debt instrument,\" in the case of an SEC registrant: (1) any indebtedness of such registrant if such indebtedness is not shown in the certified annual report as part of the total liabilities of such registrant; and (2) any indebtedness of an off-balance-sheet entity if the proceeds from the issuance of such indebtedness are used directly or indirectly to acquire stock in such registrant (thereby denying the deduction for payments on debt instruments not included as liabilities for purposes of shareholder recording).
