Allows the Secretaries to collect monies from a contract so long as collection is secondary to the land management goals the contract is supposed to accomplish.Amends the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1993 to repeal the Appeals Reform Act (regarding Forest Service decisionmaking and appeals reform).Provides that in any action under any law for writs of prohibitory or mandatory injunction against agency action in which the agency has found that such action is necessary to restore fire-adapted forest or rangeland ecosystems, the reviewing court shall: (1) consider the public interest in avoiding long-term harm to such ecosystems; and (2) give deference to any agency finding, based upon information in its administrative record, that the public interest in avoiding the short-term effects of such action is outweighed by the public interest in avoiding long-term harm to such ecosystems."
