    "text": "Requires each executive agency with procurement authority to: (1) take specified steps to ensure substantial participation in Federal advertising procurements by minority businesses; (2) develop a long-term comprehensive plan for implementing such requirement; and (3) assess efforts to increase the utilization of minority businesses in the advertising industry as prime contractors and subcontractors.Amends the Small Business Act to require current small business procurement contracting and subcontracting goals with the Government to apply separately to small businesses in the advertising industry.Directs the Administrators of the Small Business Administration (SBA) and General Services (GSA) to expand inclusion on GSA schedules of small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and other minority businesses in the advertising industry and to provide greater opportunities for such businesses to participate in orders under such schedules.Requires each executive agency to submit to the SBA Administrator for review any proposed bundling of contract requirements which includes Federal advertising requirements.Directs the Secretary of Commerce and the SBA Administrator to jointly carry out a feasibility study to determine the appropriateness of establishing an awards program for executive agencies for increasing minority business opportunity in Federal advertising procurement."
