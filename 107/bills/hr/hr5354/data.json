Entitles the spouses and children of such victims to status as permanent resident aliens, without regard to their current status, if they apply for permanent resident status within two years after enactment of this Act. Prohibits awarding honorary citizenship to any alien or granting permanent resident status to any family member of any alien who is inadmissible or deportable under the Immigration and Nationality Act, including any perpetrator of such attacks."
