    "text": "Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 2002 - States that it is U.S. policy to work cooperatively with the Russian Federation to prevent the diversion of weapons of mass destruction and material and scientific and technical expertise necessary to design and build such weapons.Amends the Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 1993 to waive restrictions on certain assistance to the independent states of the former Soviet Union if the President certifies to Congress that such waiver is in the U.S. national security interests.States that it is U.S. policy to establish with the Russian Federation inventories of, and data exchanges concerning, nuclear warheads and certain nuclear materials. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to allow the reciprocal exchange of such restricted data.Authorizes appropriations for FY 2003 to carry out cooperative threat reduction and related programs with the Russian Federation.Supports the President's objective for the United States, by FY 2012, to maintain between 1,700 to 2,200 operationally deployed nuclear warheads.Extends through FY 2003 the U.S. moratorium on underground testing of nuclear weapons. Requires the President to notify Congress 12 months prior to conducting any such test.Requires reports on: (1) progress made in establishing the U.S.-Russian nuclear inventories and data exchanges; (2) the number and posture of U.S. nuclear warheads; (3) options for achieving the FY 2012 level of U.S. operationally deployed nuclear warheads; and (4) options on reducing the time required to conduct an underground nuclear test."
