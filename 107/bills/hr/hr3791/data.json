Allows such a loan if the total amount of SBA loans to such business does not exceed $5 million. Requires the Administrator, in evaluating each loan applicant, to consult with and give considerable weight to the assessments, recommendations, and conclusions of the regional technology consultant regarding the technological feasibility and commercial viability of the applicant's business plan for the use of such funds, including any technological research or development involved. Requires the Administrator to select one nonprofit organization in each technology region to serve as such consultant."
