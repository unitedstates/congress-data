Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award grants to local educational agencies to recruit, retain, and train high-quality teachers through one or more specified types of activities.Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to revise student loan forgiveness for teachers under the Federal Family Education Loan and Federal Direct Loan programs. Expands forgiveness eligibility by: (1) eliminating requirements allowing only certain new borrowers to participate; and (2) increasing the types of eligible teaching locations and subjects. Eliminates a service requirement that an individual teach at least five consecutive complete school years before being eligible for program benefits. Increases to $20,000 the aggregate amount of an individual teacher's student loan obligation which may be forgiven, and revises the rate of repayment."
