Directs the Secretary, upon qualification of a country, to pay to the government of such country, every three months, an amount determined according to a specified formula. Prohibits the Secretary from making payment to previously dollarized British Virgin Islands, East Timor, the Republic of El Salvador, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, the Republic of Panama, or the Turks and Caicos Islands, until specified conditions are met."
