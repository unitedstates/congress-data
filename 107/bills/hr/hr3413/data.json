Includes post-emergency crisis counseling, outreach, intervention, and extended therapeutic services.Sets forth grant requirements, including the development of a statewide plan and coordination with other governmental programs (including those of the Federal Emergency Management Agency) and providers of mental health services.Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States to develop their statewide plans, requiring such plans to address the need: (1) for increased capacity for emergency response; (2) of special populations such as children, the elderly, the disabled, and those with pre-existing mental health disorders; and (3) for informing the public and coordinating with other mental health service providers. Requires such plans to designate a primarily responsible State official.Requires the Secretary to establish within the Center for Mental Health Services a National Mental Health Crisis Response Technical Assistance Center to provide technical assistance during emergencies and for developing and implementing plans and policy guidelines. Requires such Center to conduct training and serve as the principal clearinghouse for information concerning the mental health aspects of public health emergencies.Directs the Secretary to award grants for training mental health professionals to treat individuals who are victims of disasters."
