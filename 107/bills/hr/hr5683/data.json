Prohibits any Federal financial assistance from being disbursed to a State or local government unit unless the recipient is taking certain enforcement actions with regard to covered dwellings.Provides for civil actions in an appropriate United States District Court or State court for alleged misconduct under this Act. Permits the Attorney General to commence civil actions or intervene in civil actions under this Act.Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to issue any regulations necessary to carry out this Act.Prohibits any State, political jurisdiction, or other such jurisdiction from requiring or permitting any action that would violate this Act."
