Eliminates provisions for decreasing Federal matching funds and for terminating grant program authority (thus making the authority permanent).Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to extend the authorization of appropriations for after-school and life skills programs for at-risk youth.Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop a model violence prevention program for LEAs; and (2) establish and maintain a national clearinghouse to provide LEAs with information on alternative violence prevention programs, and technical assistance to establish and operate them."
