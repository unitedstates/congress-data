Requires verification of the identity of the victim and proof of claim prior to release of the information. Protects businesses from liability for good-faith releases of information for identification and prosecution of identity theft or to assist a victim.Authorizes civil enforcement actions by State attorneys general regarding identity theft and allows intervention by the U.S. Attorney General.Amends the: (1) Fair Credit Reporting Act to direct a consumer reporting agency to block the reporting of any information identified by the consumer in such consumer's file resulting from identity theft, subject to specified requirements; and (2) Internet False Identification Prevention Act of 2000 to include within report contents specified descriptions regarding identity theft."
