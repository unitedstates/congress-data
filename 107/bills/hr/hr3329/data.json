Exempts retailers from additional labeling if the ginseng is appropriately labeled by the packer or importer. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to impose penalties for violations of such requirement.Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, respecting dietary supplement labeling, to state that \"ginseng\" shall be used only in reference to an herb or herbal ingredient that: (1) is part of a plant of the species of the genus Panax; and (2) is produced in compliance with U.S. pesticide laws. Provides for a specified enforcement plan to prohibit the importation of dietary supplements mislabeled as a ginseng."
