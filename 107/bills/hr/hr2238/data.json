Authorizes the Secretary to acquire any such land subject to an easement for water supply facilities and equipment associated with the withdrawal and delivery of water by a utility from Fern Lake to Middlesboro, Kentucky, and environs.Directs the Secretary to: (1) revise the boundaries of the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park to include such acquired land; (2) protect the lake as a source of untreated water; (3) contract to sell the untreated water to a utility that delivers water to Middlesboro, Kentucky, and environs; and (4) use water sale proceeds (after reductions for park water service offsets) for expenditure at the park, without further appropriation. Requires the utility contract to ensure an equitable balance between protecting the park and providing sufficient water.Requires the Secretary to consult with the appropriate State (Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia) officials and tourism organizations."
