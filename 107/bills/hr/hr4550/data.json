Prohibits the payment of a trade readjustment allowance to an adversely affected worker who engages in self-employment activities, or who has engaged in such activities during any part of the certification period, for any week occurring after the close of the 26-week period that begins on the date of the establishment of the small business or, if on the date of such establishment the worker has fewer than 26 weeks remaining of eligibility for receipt of trade readjustment allowances, the close of the remaining number of weeks. Prescribes a formula for calculation of such an allowance during the certification period.Amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) (Federal Unemployment Tax Act) to provide that a self-employment assistance program shall not be considered to conform to IRC requirements solely because it expressly or in effect waives the requirement that eligible individuals be identified as likely to exhaust regular unemployment compensation in the case of individuals certified under the trade adjustment assistance program pursuant to the Trade Act of 1974."
