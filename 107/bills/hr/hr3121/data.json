    "text": "High Plains Groundwater Resource Conservation Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary), through the U.S. Geological Survey and in cooperation with the State Geologists of the High Plains Aquifer States (Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming), to develop and carry out a hydrogeologic mapping, modeling, and monitoring program for the High Plains Aquifer.Requires the Secretary to establish a High Plains Aquifer Coordination Council to: (1) ensure that mapping, modeling, and monitoring efforts relating to the Aquifer are in place to provide information on the water resources of the Aquifer, including sustainability; (2) facilitate coordination of Federal, State, and local programs relating to the groundwater resources of the Aquifer; (3) evaluate the effectiveness of Federal and State programs in addressing present and anticipated groundwater resources issues relating to the Aquifer; and (4) provide recommendations to the Secretary, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Governors of such States regarding programs, policies, and changes in Federal and State law to address such resources issues of the Aquifer.Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to direct the Secretary of Agriculture in FY 2003 through 2012 to provide cost-share payments, incentive payments, and technical assistance to eligible producers (persons who are engaged in livestock or agricultural production) who enter into contracts with the Secretary through a High Plains Aquifer Ground Water Conservation Incentives Program. Directs the Commodity Credit Corporation to make available specified amounts in FY 2003 through 2012 to carry out such Program.Requires that lands eligible for the Environmental Conservation Acreage Reserve Program which would result in significant per acre savings of groundwater resources of the Aquifer if removed from agriculture production to be awarded 90 Program bid points, to be designated as groundwater conservation points, in addition to any other ratings such lands may receive.Requires such Secretary to prepare a report regarding the impacts of the commodity programs administered by the Department of Agriculture on the water resources of the Aquifer.Requires the Secretary to provide financial assistance to the eight High Plains Aquifer States to provide educational programs related to this Act."
