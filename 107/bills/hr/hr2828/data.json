Requires each entity to agree to distribute to each member or persons receiving service the amount collected from such member or person.Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) waive any requirement that an entity pay remaining or additional operation and maintenance charges; and (2) pay a refund to, and forego collection of operation and maintenance charges for the remainder of the year from, any individual within the Project who holds a contract entered into pursuant to the Warren Act and who is not within a district that otherwise receives a payment and waiver under this Act.Provides that amounts not paid by an entity to the Bureau of Reclamation for the operation and maintenance of the reserved works for 2001 shall be funded from the appropriations authorized by this Act."
