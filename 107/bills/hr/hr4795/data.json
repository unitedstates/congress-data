Makes the database available to Federal and State agencies, Indian tribes, foreign governments, institutions of higher education, and international wildlife authorities.Directs the Secretary of the Interior (through the U.S. Geological Survey) and the Secretary of Agriculture (through the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) to develop surveillance and monitoring programs to identify: (1) the rate of infection; (2) the cause and extent of the spread of the disease; and (3) areas promoting spread of the disease. Requires the Secretaries to cooperate with State and tribal agencies in developing the monitoring programs. Authorizes the Secretaries to establish standards for the collection and assessment of data.Directs the Secretary of the Interior to allocate funds to State and tribal agencies for developing and implementing disease management strategies based upon: (1) the relative scope of incidence of the disease; (2) expenditures on disease management; (3) comprehensive and integrated programs for disease management between wildlife and agricultural agencies; and (4) rapid response to outbreaks.Directs the Secretary of the Interior (through the U.S. Geological Survey) to expand and accelerate research on the disease.Directs the Secretary of Agriculture: (1) to provide for the upgrading of Federal laboratories approved to process samples from the surveillance and monitoring programs; and (2) expand and accelerate research on the disease through the Agricultural Research Service and Cooperative State Research grant programs."
