Subjects such practices to certain Federal Power Act sanctions.Amends the Federal Power Act to require FERC to promulgate criteria governing waivers and exemptions from requirements regarding: (1) issuance of securities; (2) accounts and recordkeeping; and (3) officials dealing in securities (including any prospective blanket order).Places a moratorium upon such waivers and exemptions until the criteria mandated for promulgation become effective. Directs FERC to review previously issued waivers.
