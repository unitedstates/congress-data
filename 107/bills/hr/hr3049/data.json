Requires that such assistance be provided, to the extent practicable, through international agencies, private voluntary organizations, and eligible Afghan resistance organizations.Authorizes the Broadcasting Board of Governors to make grants for, and requires submission of a plan for establishing, surrogate radio broadcasting by RFE/RL, Incorporated (formerly known as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty) to the people of Afghanistan (to be designated as Radio Free Afghanistan).Requires the President to submit quarterly reports to the appropriate congressional committees on violations by foreign countries or nationals of measures directed against the Taliban pursuant to specified United Nations Security Council resolutions. Requires such reports to evaluate the seriousness of any violations and authorizes the President to impose sanctions for violations that put at risk the lives of U.S. armed forces personnel or citizens, including: (1) denying assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or the Arms Export Control Act; (2) denying licenses for transfers of goods, services, or technology controlled under the Arms Export Control Act, the Export Administration Act of 1979, or the Export Administration Regulations; or (3) applying restrictions under the Trading With the Enemy Act."
