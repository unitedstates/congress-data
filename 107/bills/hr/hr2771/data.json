Entitles each eligible individual to a specified limited ISA tax credit for the taxable year involved, treated as a tax overpayment, to be transferred by the Secretary for crediting by the Commissioner, as a contribution equal to the tax overpayment, to such eligible individual's ISA for its sole use. Specifies related contribution incentives.Amends SSA title II to establish a new minimum monthly Social Security benefit for certain low-income beneficiaries.Amends SSA title II to prescribe formula changes for computation of the primary insurance amount, including cost-of-living increases, bend points, adjustments for changes in life expectancy, and coverage of disabled beneficiaries.Makes appropriations to the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics for specified research on the Consumer Price Index.Phases-in an increase in the Social Security normal retirement age to 67.Amends SSA title VII (Administration) to prescribe a mechanism for ensuring solvency in the Social Security trust funds."
