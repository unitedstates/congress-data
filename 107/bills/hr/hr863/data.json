Specifies the membership of an advisory board to be established by State or local governments, including a nonprofit, nongovernmental victim advocacy organization.Requires a State or specially qualified local government unit to repay unexpended amounts to the Attorney General before the expiration of the 36-month period beginning on the date of the award, providing for a one-time extension of up to 12 months.Sets the Federal share of the grant at 90 percent of total program costs. Prohibits the Federal share from exceeding 50 percent of the approved cost of constructing juvenile detention or correctional facilities.Requires grant and sub-grant assessment reports to the Attorney General (with a waiver provision) and to Congress.Directs the Attorney General to make grants to Indian tribes, or consortia of tribes, for programs to strengthen tribal juvenile justice systems and to hold tribal youth accountable.Specifies that each Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant award shall remain available to the recipient for not more than 36 months."
