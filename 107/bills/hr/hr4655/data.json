    "text": "Safety and Self-Sufficiency Act of 2002 - Amends part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) of title IV of the Social Security Act to change from discretionary to mandatory certification by its chief executive officer that a State has established and is enforcing standards and procedures addressing domestic and sexual violence. Revises current requirements for such standards and procedures, adding new ones for caseworker training and optional use of qualified professionals.Requires the initial assessment for individual responsibility plans to cover potential barriers to employment, including domestic or sexual violence, mental or physical health, learning disability, substance abuse, English as a second language, or insufficient housing, transportation or child care.Requires a State, before imposing a noncompliance sanction or penalty against an individual, to: (1) consider specifically whether the individual has been subjected to domestic or sexual violence; and (2) if such violence is identified, make a reasonable effort to modify or waive program requirements or prohibitions, and offer the individual referral to voluntary services. Prohibits imposition of sanctions or penalties if domestic or sexual violence is a significant contributing factor to the individual's noncompliance.Allows a State to: (1) count survivors of domestic or sexual violence as being engaged in work for work participation rates; and (2) exclude such survivors from the 20 percent limitation on the hardship exception to normal termination of TANF after five years.Sets a penalty for State noncompliance with the requirements of this Act at five percent of the State family assistance grant."
