    "text": "After School Education and Anti-Crime Act of 2001 - Amends the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act to extend the maximum grant duration to five years.Revises grant application provisions to require: (1) information demonstrating that the grant recipient will provide a certain minimum portion of annual cost of assisted activities from sources other than such grants, with a certain maximum portion of such costs allowed to be from funds provided by the Secretary of Education under other Federal programs; and (2) assurance of maintenance of the recipient's fiscal effort from non-Federal sources.Allows the use of grant funds to establish or expand community learning centers. Allows such centers to provide one or more of specified listed activities, including after-school programs that include at least two of the following: mentoring programs, academic assistance, recreational activities, or technology training. Authorizes centers to include drug, alcohol, and gang prevention activities, health and nutrition counseling, and job skills preparation activities. Requires at least two-thirds of appropriated funds under such Act to be used for after-school programs.Directs local educational agencies (LEAs), schools, or consortia, in carrying out center activities, to: (1) request volunteers from business and academic communities, and law enforcement organizations, to serve as mentors or to assist in other ways; (2) ensure that youth in the local community participate in designing the after-school activities; (3) develop creative methods of conducting outreach to youth in the community; (4) request donations of computer equipment and other materials and equipment; and (5) work with State and local park and recreation agencies so that activities carried out by the agencies prior to this Act's enactment are not duplicated.Includes in the meaning of community learning center LEA operation of such a center in a school in conjunction with law enforcement organizations such as the Police Athletic and Activity League."
