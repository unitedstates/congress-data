Exempts from such prohibition certain: (1) forward contracting arrangements under which the producer retains pre-delivery operational control of the livestock; (2) cooperatives that own, or feed livestock and provide such livestock for slaughter; or (3) certain small producer-owned or-controlled packers.Directs the Attorney General to establish in the Department of Justice an Office of Special Counsel for Agriculture to handle agricultural antitrust and related matters.Requires: (1) a person in the business of purchasing livestock, poultry, or a basic agricultural commodity for wholesale resale who files a premerger notice under the Clayton Act to file simultaneously a premerger notice with the Secretary of Agriculture; and (2) the Secretary to review the proposed merger and report to the Office of Special Counsel for Agriculture.."
