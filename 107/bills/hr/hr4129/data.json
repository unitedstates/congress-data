Deauthorizes the balance in excess of this amount. Allows such amount to be used to provide 65 percent of the Federal share pursuant to the Act to acquire water and water rights for project purposes (including instream flows), to complete specified project facilities, to implement water conservation measures relating to the Project (including the use of reverse osmosis membrane technologies, water recycling, and conjunctive use), to stabilize high mountain lakes and appurtenant facilities, and to develop power.Directs the Secretary to allow for prepayment of any additional or supplemental contracts providing for repayment of Project municipal and industrial water delivery facilities. Repeals a requirement that the District exercise of its prepayment rights by the end of FY 2002.(Sec. 2) Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts with the Provo River Water Users Association or any of its member unit contractors for water from Provo River in Utah for: (1) the impounding, storage, and carriage of nonproject water for domestic, municipal, industrial, and other beneficial purposes, using facilities associated with the Provo River Project; and (2) the exchange of water among Provo River Project contractors for such purposes using those facilities."
