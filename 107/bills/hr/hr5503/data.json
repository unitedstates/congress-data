Directs dispensers to report the information required under this Act to the Secretary as prescribed by the Secretary, with specified exceptions.Requires the Secretary to specify the electronic format for the reporting of the information required under this Act, but allows the Secretary to waive the required format for an individual dispenser. Allows the Secretary to provide information from the monitoring system to practitioners and specified government personnel under certain circumstances. States that this Act shall not preclude any authority from securing information as otherwise authorized by law.Directs the Secretary to make reasonable efforts to implement a real-time electronic system.Specifies the circumstances in which information provided by the Secretary from the monitoring system can lawfully be subsequently transmitted.Assesses civil monetary penalties for the failure to communicate information requested by the Secretary and for the unauthorized disclosure of information transmitted by the Secretary. Allows a State to have its own prescription monitoring system to the exclusion of the Federal program so long as the State system provides the information required by this Act to the Federal program in a fashion set forth by the Secretary."
