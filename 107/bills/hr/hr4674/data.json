Directs the Secretary, in assessing grant applications, to give greater weight to the incidence of gun violence and the need to reduce the availability of guns in the jurisdictions involved than to any other factors. Permits such units to use the grant only to conduct a gun buyback program in accordance with the approved grant application.Directs the chief executive of a local government desiring a grant to submit to the Secretary an application that contains assurances that: (1) within 60 days after the program collects a gun, the gun will be destroyed (or, if it is an inoperable curio or relic with historic significance, donated to a museum for display); (2) the local law enforcement authority is able to collect guns safely under the program; and (3) the government has the authority to grant an appropriate amnesty to persons from whom guns are obtained under the program.Directs the Secretary to delegate to the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms the authority to carry out this Act."
