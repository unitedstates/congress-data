Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a program to make advance payments to providers of health insurance on behalf of individuals eligible for such credit.Amends the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make: (1) a grant to each State that has not created a qualified high risk pool, for the State's costs of creation and initial operation of such a pool; and (2) a matching grant to cover 50 percent of the losses incurred by a State in operating such a pool it has established that restricts the premiums charged to no more than 150 percent of the premium for applicable standard risk rates and that offers a choice of two or more coverage options. Requires, in the application of specified provisions and alternative State mechanisms under PHSA, increased access to health insurance for individuals eligible for the displaced worker health insurance credit, through the use of guaranteed issue, qualified high risk pools, and other appropriate State mechanisms.Declares that this Act shall have no impact on the Social Security trust funds.
