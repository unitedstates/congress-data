Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make such grants to elementary and secondary schools. Allows use of such grant funds only for: (1) educational or outreach materials or resources designed to increase parental involvement in their children's education; or (2) the salary or benefits of an individual who is an eligible parent liaison. Requires the Secretary, in making such grants, to give preference to: (1) schools with a large percentage of students whose parents have limited English proficiency; and (2) schools at which the involvement of parents in the education of their children has traditionally been low. Requires grantee schools to involve students' parents and parent organizations in hiring decisions regarding eligible parent liaisons."
