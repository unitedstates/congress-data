Deems the $5 million limitation on the use of special simplified acquisition procedures to be $10 million.Requires executive agencies to use specified streamlined acquisition authorities and procedures for such procurements.Allows executive agencies who engage in necessary basic, applied, and advanced research and development projects that have the potential to facilitate defense against or recovery from terrorism or a terrorist attack to exercise specified authority accorded the Secretary of Defense for research project transactions other than contracts and grants and to carry out prototype projects.Directs executive agencies to conduct market research to identify the capabilities available in the marketplace in furtherance of defense against or recovery from terrorism or a terrorist attack."
