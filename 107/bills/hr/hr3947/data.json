Provides for: (1) the crediting of monetary proceeds from the disposition of real and related personal property to existing agency accounts to pay for capital asset expenditures of that agency; and (2) implementation of such disposal and accounting requirements for FY 2003-2007.Authorizes the: (1) conveyance of surplus Federal property to non-profit organizations for preservation purposes, and generally for public airport use; and (2) abandonment, destruction, or other disposal of property if it has no commercial value, or if costs of continued care and handling would exceed its fair market value.Amends the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act to revise procedures for the consideration of surplus real property for homeless assistance."
