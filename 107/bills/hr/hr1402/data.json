Requires an independent scientific peer review before implementing a finding that any species is endangered or threatened, or that any species currently listed in such manner should be removed. Prohibits the Secretary from making any such determination unless it is supported by data obtained by species observation in the field.Directs the Secretary to make such determinations and revisions by a rule made on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.Prohibits the Secretary from adding to or removing a species from such lists unless such action is supported by substantial evidence.Requires the Secretary to prepare and publish with a final rule an analysis of the economic impact of such rule.Prohibits the Secretary from releasing any experimental population on or affecting private property except by a rulemaking.Requires the Secretary to approve or disapprove an application for an incidental take permit within 90 days."
