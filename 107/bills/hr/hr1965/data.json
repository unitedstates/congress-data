    "text": "Merit Systems Protection Board Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 2001 - Amends Federal civil service law to authorize the Merit Systems Protection Board to provide Federal employees and agencies with alternative dispute resolution (ADR) processes to apply to personnel disputes involving removals, suspensions for more than 14 days, and other adverse actions and removals based on unacceptable employee performance. Allows ADR services only upon joint request of the employee and agency. Directs the Board to test and evaluate a variety of ADR techniques. Authorizes the Board to establish an early intervention ADR process, upon joint request of both parties, after an agency has issued a notice letter of proposed action to an employee but before an appeal is filed with the Board. Requires the Board to develop a training and credentialing program to ensure that program neutrals have a sufficient understanding of issues that arise during the ADR process.Requires the Board's Office of Policy and Evaluation to establish criteria for evaluating the ADR program and to prepare a report as to whether mandatory ADR is desirable, effective, and appropriate for cases decided by Federal agencies.Establishes within the Board the Administrative Judge Pay Schedule, with pay levels comparable to that of other Federal administrative law judges. Outlines provisions for advancement within the Pay Schedule, as well as transition provisions for current judges. Authorizes the Board Chairman to phase in such pay rates, under specified conditions and limitations."
