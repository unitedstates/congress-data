Permits an individual to defer payments of the additional tax imposed by such deemed sale (but not beyond such person's death). Sets forth interest provisions. Requires provision of tax payment security.Exempts certain U.S. citizens from being treated as a covered expatriate who: (1) became a citizen of the United States and another country at birth; or (2) relinquished U.S. citizenship before reaching 18 Permits an individual to make an irrevocable decision to be taxed as a U.S. citizen with respect to all property otherwise covered by the expatriation provisions.

Subjects the following retirement plans to the provisions of this Act: (1) qualified retirement plans, including specified annuity plans and individual retirement accounts; (2) specified deferred compensation plans; and (3) foreign retirement or pension plans.Establishes special rules for covered expatriates' interests in trusts and qualified trusts.Includes in a recipient's gross income the value of property received by gift or bequest from a covered expatriate, with exceptions for transfers otherwise subject to estate or gift tax. Makes such provisions applicable to gifts and bequests received on or after September 12, 2002, from an individual whose expatriation date occurs after such date.Makes such expatriate tax provisions, unless otherwise provided for by this Act, effective on or after September 12, 2002.Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to deny a former citizen reentry into the United States for noncompliance with the provisions of this title. (Current law denies reentry based upon tax-motivated expatriation.) Permits Internal Revenue Service (IRS)-INS information sharing for such purpose. Makes such provisions effective upon enactment of this Act.(Sec. 202) Amends the Code to establish IRS service user fee authority through September 30, 2012. Sets forth program criteria and average fee requirements.(Sec. 203) Authorizes IRS to enter into partial payment installment agreements with taxpayers. Requires review of such agreements at least every two years. Makes such provision effective for agreements entered into on or after the date of enactment of this Act."
