    "text": "Ronald C. Sheffield Federal Property Protection Act of 2002 - Revises provisions regarding the appointment of special police of the General Services Administration (GSA).Establishes in GSA an Office of the Federal Protective Service (FPS) which shall be headed by a Commissioner. Authorizes the GSA Administrator to designate Office employees as officers and agents for duty in protecting Federal property and persons on such property. Empowers such officers and agents to: (1) enforce Federal laws and regulations; (2) carry firearms; (3) make arrests without a warrant; (4) serve warrants and subpoenas; and (5) conduct investigations.Allows the Administrator to enter into agreements with Federal agencies and State and local governments to obtain authority for officers and agents to enforce Federal, State, and local laws concurrently with other Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers.Authorizes the Administrator of GSA to fix the rates of basic pay for officers and agents so as to enable them to be appropriately compensated in comparison to personnel performing comparable duties in other law enforcement organizations in the local labor market.Requires the Commissioner to prescribe minimum standards of suitability for employment to be applied in the contracting of security personnel.Expresses the sense of Congress that the number of full-time employees designated as FPS officers and agents should be maintained at 750.Authorizes the Administrator to determine and fix the maximum age limit for entry as an FPS Officer. Sets forth provisions governing Federal retirement, annuities, mandatory separation, and overtime of such officers. Entitles such officers to the same pay and benefits as law enforcement officers are provided under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990."
