Creates a foreign intelligence exception involving the interception of electronic communications.Permits a Government agency authorized to use a pen register or trap and trace device to use technology reasonably available that restricts the recording or decoding of electronic or other impulses to the dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information utilized in the processing and transmitting of wire and electronic communications.Directs the court, upon application to it, to enter an ex parte order authorizing the installation and use of a pen register or a trap and trace device: (1) if the court finds that the Government attorney has certified that the information likely to be obtained is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation (which order shall apply nationwide); or (2) within the jurisdiction of the court if the court finds that the State law enforcement or investigative officer has certified that the information likely to be obtained is relevant.Authorizes any U.S. Attorney or acting U.S. Attorney to have installed and to use a pen register or trap and trace device under specified emergency situations, including situations involving: (1) an immediate threat to national security; and (2) an ongoing attack on a protected computer that constitutes a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment greater than one year."
