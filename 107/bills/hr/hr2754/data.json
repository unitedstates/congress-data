    "text": "Federal Prison Industries Reform Act of 2001 - Amends the Federal criminal code to make exceptions to prohibitions against the use of prison labor regarding goods manufactured, produced, or mined by prisoners who are participating in: (1) industrial operations of Federal Prison Industries (FPI); and (2) any pilot project approved as a foreign labor substitute by the Foreign Labor Substitute Panel. Directs the Attorney General to establish such panel.Rewrites FPI provisions, including provisions regarding operating objectives, performance standards, voluntariness, wage rates, protection of specified information, and vocational training. Exempts FPI from public contracting and procurement laws.Sets forth provisions regarding sales to agencies and not-for-profits, sales of certain commodities, participation in foreign labor substitute pilot projects, participation in Bureau of Justice Assistance Pilot Projects, requirements for contracts with private companies, goals for certain businesses, and job opportunities for blind and severely disabled individuals.Specifies that the mandatory source preference does not apply to services. Requires each Federal department or agency to report purchases from FPI to the Federal Procurement Data System in the same manner as it reports to such System any acquisition in an amount in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold.Directs: (1) the Attorney General to implement a pilot program to test the effect of changes to the mandatory source preference; and (2) the Comptroller General to provide for an independent evaluation of FPI operations to be carried out each year."
