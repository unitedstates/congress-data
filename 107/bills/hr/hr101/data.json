    "text": "National Science Education Enhancement Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), with respect to teacher professional development activities, to include support for mentoring activities for science, mathematics, engineering, and technology teachers.Includes information on model science, mathematics, engineering, and technology teacher mentoring programs among the information which the Eisenhower National Clearinghouse for Mathematics and Science Education (Clearinghouse) is required to disseminate.Includes such mentoring programs under teacher professional development program requirements for State plans, accountability reports, and local activities.Revises ESEA provisions for the allocation and use of funds for the Clearinghouse. Requires such funds to be used to: (1) solicit and gather qualitative and evaluative materials and programs, review their evaluation, rank their effectiveness, and distribute results of reviews, as well as excerpts of materials and links to Internet sites and information on-line communities of users to teachers; and (2) establish an Internet site offering a search mechanism to assist site visitors in identifying information on science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education instructional materials and programs, including electronic links to information on classroom demonstrations and experiments, teachers who have used materials or participated in programs, vendors, curricula, and textbooks. Directs the Clearinghouse to give particular attention to the effective use of materials and technology in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education. Directs the National Academy of Sciences to study and report on the Clearinghouse.Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants for summer professional development institutes for teachers.Includes providing technology training software and instructional materials to teachers among local uses of ESEA school technology resource grants.Requires a portion of each ESEA 21st Century Community Learning Centers program grant to be used to provide after-school day care services that focus on science activities.Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to treat technology training, tutoring teachers in the uses of classroom technology, as community service by college students under the work-study program. Increases funding for such program and reserves the amount of such increase to compensate students employed in technology training or tutoring teachers in the uses of classroom technology.Directs the Secretary of Commerce to study and report to Congress on specified aspects of a comprehensive approach to providing technologically competent teachers for U.S. schools."
