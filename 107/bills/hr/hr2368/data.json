Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Directors of specified international financial institutions to use the U.S. vote to deny multilateral nonhumanitarian assistance to Viet Nam unless the President determines and certifies to Congress that such requirements have been met.Subtitle B: Assistance to Support Democracy in Viet Nam - Authorizes the President to provide U.S. assistance, through appropriate nongovernmental organizations, for the support of individuals and organizations to promote human rights and nonviolent democratic change in Viet Nam. Authorizes appropriations for FY 2002 and 2003.Subtitle C: United States Public Diplomacy - Declares it is U.S. policy to take such measures as are necessary to overcome the jamming of Radio Free Asia by the Government of Viet Nam. Authorizes appropriations for FY 2002 and 2003.(Sec. 222) Declares it is U.S. policy that educational and cultural exchange programs with Viet Nam should promote progress toward freedom and democracy in Viet Nam.Subtitle D: United States Refugee Policy - Declares it is U.S. policy to offer refugee resettlement to Viet Nam nationals (including members of the Montagnard ethnic minority groups) who are eligible for the Orderly Departure Program or any other U.S. refugee program but who were deemed ineligible for reasons of administrative error or certain circumstances beyond their control. Makes migration and refugee assistance available for FY 2001 through 2003 for the protection (including, in appropriate cases, the resettlement) of Vietnamese refugees and asylum seekers, including Montagnards in Cambodia.Subtitle E: Annual Report on Progress Toward Freedom and Democracy in Viet Nam - Directs the Secretary of State to report annually to Congress: (1) that the requirements contained in the President's determination and certification have been met, if applicable; (2) on U.S. efforts to secure transmission sites for Radio Free Asia in countries in close geographical proximity to Viet Nam; (3) on efforts to ensure that educational and cultural exchange programs with Viet Nam promote certain policies regarding participation in such programs; and (4) on steps taken by the United States to offer refugee resettlement to certain Viet Nam nationals."
