    "text": "Pipeline Safety Act of 2001 - Amends Federal pipeline safety law to set forth requirements with respect to: (1) the review of gas pipeline and hazardous liquid pipeline personnel qualification programs; and (2) support for research and development (R&D) of innovative alternative technology development as it relates to pipeline safety.Requires each operator to: (1) analyze the risks to each facility located in a high-density population area or environmentally sensitive area; and (2) adopt a written integrity management program to reduce risks at such facilities.Requires operators of a gas pipeline or hazardous liquid pipeline facility to educate the public on the use of a one-call notification system before excavation and other damage prevention activities, the possible hazards associated with unintended facility releases, the physical indications that a pipeline release may have occurred, the steps that should be taken for public safety, and how to report such release.Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation, upon accepting a State's pipeline safety program certification, to make an agreement with the State authority to develop a plan in which it has a role in the oversight of interstate pipeline facilities by participating: (1) in special investigations involving interstate pipeline incidents within its borders; (2) in oversight of new construction of interstate pipelines there; and (3) as an interstate agent by carrying out inspection responsibilities for interstate pipelines within its borders to ensure compliance with Federal pipeline safety standards. (Currently, a State has authority over intrastate pipelines and pipeline facilities provided the program certification is made.)Increases civil penalties for violations of specified Federal pipeline safety standards. Establishes both civil and criminal penalties for engaging in an excavation activity and subsequently damaging a pipeline facility without reporting it promptly.Requires pipeline owners and operators to provide information for the National Pipeline Mapping System.Authorizes the Secretary to study how best to preserve environmental resources in conjunction with maintaining pipeline rights-of-way."
