Makes the mandated reclamation fee 1/2 of the amount that would otherwise apply and such entities, respectively, ineligible for any subsequent allocation.Allows a State or Indian tribe to use such payment to make grants to achieve any of the priorities in the Act's purview that remain unmet in the State or on the lands under the tribe's jurisdiction."
