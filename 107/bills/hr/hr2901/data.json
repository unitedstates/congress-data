    "text": "United States Cruise Vessel Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to issue a certificate of documentation with a temporary coastwise endorsement for an eligible foreign-built cruise vessel to operate in domestic itineraries in the transportation of passengers in the coastwise trade between U.S. ports if such vessel meets certain requirements, including that: (1) the operator of the vessel promises that any repairs will be performed in a U.S. shipyard; and (2) such operator, with a specified exception, executes a contract with one or more U.S. shipyards for the construction of two or more cruise vessels with a total combined berth or stateroom capacity equal to at least that of the operator's vessel to which a certificate of documentation has been issued. Terminates the coastwise endorsement for an eligible cruise vessel 24 months after the delivery date for any replacement vessel. Authorizes the operator of an eligible cruise vessel issued a certificate of documentation, or a cruise vessel that has been constructed under contract, to place such vessel under foreign registry.Prohibits eligible cruise vessels operating in domestic itineraries from operating as a ferry, regularly carrying for hire both passengers and vehicles or other cargo, or operating between or among the Hawaiian Islands.Directs the Secretary to give priority to U.S.- built cruise vessels over other eligible foreign-built cruise vessels in a comparable market that have been issued a certificate of documentation, if the Secretary determines that the employment in the coastwise trade of an eligible foreign-built cruise vessel will adversely affect the coastwise trade business of any person operating a vessel not documented under this Act.Makes special provision for vessels carrying passengers for hire into Glacier Bay or other National Park Service areas."
