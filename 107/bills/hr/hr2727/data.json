Requires that such regulation deem CCA lumber as misbranded unless its labeling discloses that: (1) it has been treated with arsenic; and (2) manufacture or commercial distribution of a product constructed with such lumber is a violation of Federal law if the product is playground equipment or any item intended for use primarily by children.Requires a study concerning the health effects of using consumer products whose usual use involves direct contact with CCA lumber."
