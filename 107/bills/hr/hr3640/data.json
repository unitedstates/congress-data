Exempts employee stock ownership plans (ESOPS) from these new ERISA provisions.Amends Internal Revenue Code to: (1) allow employees to diversify assets in ESOPS after five years, and after they've reached age 35 (but requires a trustee-to-trustee transfer for those under age 55); and (2) reduce by 50 percent the allowable deduction for employer matching contributions to defined contribution plans made in employer securities."
