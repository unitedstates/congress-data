Sets forth a civil penalty against the operator of LAX Airport for failure to comply with the requirements of this Act. Makes amounts collected from such penalties available to the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration for making grants to non-profit organizations to provide educational services, health care services, environmental services, speech and hearing services, and services to persons with disabilities in communities impacted by noise from LAX Airport."
