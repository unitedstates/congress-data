Permits the President to include in such report a recommendation on whether or not this Act should be terminated or modified.(Sec. 4) Extends such Act for another five year period.(Sec. 5) Mandates that any amendment or other modification made on or after June 13, 2001, to existing (pre-ILSA) agreements or contracts for the development of Libya's petroleum resources be considered new investment for purposes of the imposition of sanctions."
