Authorizes appropriations for FY 2003 through 2007.(Sec. 6) Requires the Director of the NSF to: (1) arrange for an assessment of the state of research on networking and information technology in the United States; and (2) continually collect and arrange for the analysis of data on the information technology workforce, including size, occupation category, education, training, compensation, and the role of foreign workers. Requires the results of the assessment and data analysis to be reported to Congress as specified.(Sec. 7) Directs the NSF to establish a center for research on information technology questions related to crisis management as part of the National High-Performance Computing Program. Authorizes the use of funds for human-computer interface technologies, network-based collaboration tools, network compatibility and reliability, wireless networks, and software and simulation.Authorizes appropriations for FY 2003 through 2007."
