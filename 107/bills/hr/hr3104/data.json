    "text": "Freedom to Fish Act - Amends the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to prohibit any fishery management plan prepared by a Regional Fishery Management Council or the Secretary of Commerce from establishing areas closed to recreational fishing unless: (1) there is a clear indication that recreational fishermen are the cause of a specific conservation problem and that less severe conservation measures will not adequately provide for conservation and management of the affected stocks of fish; (2) the closed area regulation includes specific measurable criteria to determine the conservation benefit of the closed area on such fish and provides a timetable for periodic review of the continued need for the closed area; (3) the closed area is no larger than that which is supported by the best available scientific information; or (4) provision is made to reopen the closed area to recreational fishing whenever any such condition that was the basis of the closure no longer exists.Amends the National Marine Sanctuaries Act to direct the Secretary to provide such a Council with the opportunity to propose and revise all regulations applicable to fishing within designated marine sanctuaries according to the standards and procedures of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Requires such regulations, upon approval by the Secretary, to apply within the exclusive economic zone and allows them to be applied within a State, with the approval of the State's Governor or pursuant to the Secretary's authority under such Act."
