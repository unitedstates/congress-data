Outlines labeling system requirements, including that: (1) such product shall specify a minimum age for purchase and viewing; and (2) the label should appear conspicuously on the product. Directs the FTC to establish its own labeling system if a proposal is not submitted.Prohibits a person from: (1) manufacturing or producing such a product unless it bears a label meeting requirements of this Act; or (2) selling such product to an individual under the minimum age specified under the labeling system.Provides civil penalties for violations.Renames the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act as the Federal Cigarette and Media Violence Labeling and Advertising Act."
