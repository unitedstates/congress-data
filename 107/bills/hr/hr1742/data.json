Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to the States for scholarships to outstanding secondary school graduates or exceptional certified teachers who demonstrate a commitment to and capacity for teaching at the preschool, elementary, or secondary level. Requires State agreements to require such scholarship recipients to teach full-time, in a public or public charter preschool, elementary, or secondary school in any State, for at least: (1) two years for every year of full-time assistance; or (2) one year for every year of part-time assistance. Requires that such teaching: (1) occur within the ten-year period after they complete the postsecondary education for which the scholarship was awarded; and (2) not exceed six years. Reduces such teaching requirements by one-half for individuals who teach in shortage areas designated by the Secretary.Professional Development Enhancement Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, with respect to authorized State-level uses of certain funds under the title II Dwight D. Eisenhower Professional Development Program, to include: (1) programs that include support during the initial teaching experience, such a s mentoring programs with specified required criteria; and (2) programs, with certain required components, that establish, expand, or improve alternative routes to State certification of teachers for highly qualified individuals with baccalaureate degrees who demonstrate the potential to become highly effective teachers.Quality Teacher Recruitment and Retention Act - Directs the Secretary to carry out a program of student loan forgiveness in exchange for the borrower's commitment, as a new teacher, to three consecutive years of full-time teaching in certain low-income schools or in special education teaching."
