    "text": "Citizen Service Act of 2002 - Amends the National and Community Service Act of 1990 (NCSA) and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 (DVSA) to reauthorize appropriations and revise programs administered by the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS).Includes among NCSA programs: (1) Learn and Serve America (Service-Learning); (2) AmeriCorps (AC) Grants; (3) AC-National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC). Includes among DVSA programs: (1) AC-Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA); and (2) National Senior Service Corps (NSSC), including Foster Grandparents, Senior Companions, and Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP).Title I: Amendments to the National and Community Service Act of 1990 - Subtitle A: Amendments to Subtitle A (General Provisions) - Revises NCSA purposes and definitions.Subtitle B: Amendments to Subtitle B (Service-Learning) - Revises service-learning programs for elementary and secondary students which are funded through school-based allotments to State educational agencies, territories, and Indian tribes.(Sec. 1202) Directs CNCS to give special consideration to grant applications from historically Black colleges, Hispanic-serving institutions, and tribal colleges and universities for service-learning programs at higher education institutions.Prohibits higher education institutions, in providing a matching non-Federal share for such programs, from using any Federal funds (current law allows use of Federal sources other than funds under national service programs).Requires higher education institutions, to be eligible for such service-learning assistance, to demonstrate that they meet minimum requirements under the Higher Education Act of 1965 for participation of Federal work-study students in community service activities or have received a waiver of such requirements from the Secretary of Education.(Sec. 1203) Authorizes CNCS to make grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements to various entities for: (1) community-based programs of human, educational, environmental, or public safety service by school-age participants; (2) training or technical assistance to support service-learning; (3) involve students in emergency preparedness and homeland security activities; (4) recognize students and schools for outstanding community service and service-learning programs; and (5) demonstration programs, research, and evaluation related to service-learning.(Sec. 1204) Transfers service-learning clearinghouse provisions of NCSA title I subtitle B from the current part I subtitle C to a new part IV.Subtitle C: Amendments to Subtitle C (National Service Trust Program) - Prohibits CNCS from providing grants to a Federal agency under provisions which authorize contracts or cooperative agreements to support national service programs carried out by such agencies. Eliminates CNCS assistance to such other Federal agency programs through approval of national service educational awards to their participants and deposits in the National Service Trust for such awards. Directs CNCS to provide such approval and deposits for educational awards in conjunction with approving member-based national service positions established by this Act.(Sec. 1302) Revises provisions for types of national service programs eligible for program assistance. Allows low-income individuals up to age 25 (currently up to age 24) to participate in a service-learning program to provide housing and community facilities.Authorizes assistance for the following new service programs: (1) an E-Corps to develop and assist technology programs in communities; (2) citizen involvement in public safety, public health, and disaster relief and preparedness, including recruiting and placing qualified participants as trainees as law enforcement officers, firefighters and rescue personnel, search and rescue personnel, emergency medical service workers, and/or disaster services workers; and (3) expanding the number of young people with mentors, through direct mentoring services or capacity-building activities for mentoring organizations.Requires tutoring programs, if they receive assistance, to use tutors who have high school degrees or equivalents or are enrolled to get such degrees. Requires literacy programs, if they receive assistance, to provide: (1) reading instruction based on types of research and essential components outlined in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001; and (2) tutors with training that incorporates recommendations of the National Reading Panel and research from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Sets forth requirements relating to citizenship training and oaths for individuals enrolled in approved national service positions.(Sec. 1303) Eliminates participation in a program carried out by a Federal agency from among the types of positions eligible for national service educational awards.(Sec. 1304) Authorizes CNCS to provide certain training and technical assistance to all programs assisted under national service laws. Requires addressing the training and technical assistance needs of programs which focus on and provide service opportunities for underserved rural and urban areas and populations.(Sec. 1305) Increases minimum and maximum amounts of challenge grants to assist State Commissions on National and Community Service. Eliminates certain limitations on such grant amounts, but adds matching requirements.(Sec. 1306) Revises provisions for allocation of assistance and approved national service positions to States and other eligible entities.
