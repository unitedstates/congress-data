    "text": "Recruitment and Diversity in Nursing Act of 2002 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a program in which nontraditional nursing students shall contract to serve at least two years at a health care facility with a critical shortage of nurses after attending an accredited school of nursing on a Federal scholarship. Requires the program to run from FY 2003 to 2004, and permits the Secretary to extend the program thereafter.Sets a maximum figure of 25 percent of the number of scholarships that may be used for training in advanced degree programs. Allows a recipient to complete a period of service on a part-time basis under certain conditions.Applies certain provisions applicable to the National Health Service Corps Program to the nursing scholarship program. Directs the Secretary to give preference in entering into contracts in such program to individuals in financial need.Requires the Secretary to make grants to eligible entities to carry out nursing awareness and recruitment programs in elementary schools and secondary schools. States that the program shall run from FY 2003 to 2004, and permits the Secretary to extend the program thereafter. Requires that of the schools in which a beneficiary conducts awareness and recruitment programs, at least half must have a high percentage of nontraditional students. Prohibits any grant for nursing awareness and recruitment programs from lasting for a period of more than three years."
