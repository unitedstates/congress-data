    "text": "Refugee Protection Act of 2002 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act with respect to refugee provisions to limit summary inspection procedures to emergency migration situations in which numbers of arriving aliens substantially exceed inspection capacities. Grants the Attorney General sole authority to make such determination, which shall last 90 days unless extended after consultation with the appropriate congressional committees.Revises provisions respecting inspection of aliens seeking U.S. admission, including requiring: (1) an alien to be informed of certain rights prior to removal or withdrawal of his or her admission application, and (2) review of a removal order by an immigration judge, with the right of the alien to personally appear and be represented (at his or her expense).Exempts from expedited removal procedures certain Western Hemisphere nationals or unaccompanied children.Revises the procedure used to determine whether an applicant for asylum has a credible fear of persecution.Eliminates certain: (1) limitations on judicial review of exclusion orders or asylum claims; (2) time limits on asylum applications; (3) numerical limitations on asylee adjustments; and (4) numerical limitations on population control-related refugee admissions.Makes certain mandatory asylee detention provisions discretionary.Directs the Attorney General to: (1) develop alternatives to detention of asylum seekers, including supervised shelters and noninstitutional settings for minors; (2) enter into contracts with nongovernmental agencies for alternative detention programs; and (3) establish a National Legal Orientation Support and Training Center.Requires asylum seekers not eligible for parole or alternative detention to be detained only in Immigration and Naturalization Service or approved facilities."
