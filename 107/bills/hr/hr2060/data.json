Enhances penalties for animal enterprise terrorism and establishes penalties for plant enterprise terrorism. Prohibits the use of explosives or arson against the enterprise. Provides for the death penalty under specified circumstances.Makes animal and plant enterprise terrorism a predicate offense under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation to establish and maintain a national clearinghouse for information on incidents of crime and terrorism committed against or directed at any: (1) animal or plant enterprise; (2) commercial activity because of the perceived impact of such activity on the environment; or (3) person because of such person's perceived connection with or support of any enterprise or activity.Requires the Director to: (1) award grants on a competitive basis to colleges and universities for technical assistance, threat and risk assessments, and other activities related to improving security at individual research universities; and (2) develop a comprehensive security report for universities, colleges, and nonprofit organizations which examines the threat posed by animal and plant enterprise terrorism on research activities and includes strategies for reducing such threat."
