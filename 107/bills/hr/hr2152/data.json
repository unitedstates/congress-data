Requires the Secretary to use any amounts deposited to make payments to trustees or for advance planning and design.Declares that no bond shall be an obligation of, nor shall payment of the principal be guaranteed by the United States. Provides that any amounts earned through the investment of funds under the control of a trustee shall not be subject to Federal income tax.Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit to individuals who hold such bonds. Permits a separation (including at issuance) of the ownership of such a bond and the entitlement to the credit with respect to such bond."
