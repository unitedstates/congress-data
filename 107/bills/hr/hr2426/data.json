    "text": "Remote Sensing Applications Act of 2002 - Directs the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to establish a program of grants for pilot projects to explore the integrated use of sources of remote sensing and other geospatial information to address State, local, regional, and tribal agency needs. Requires the Administrator to give preference to projects that: (1) make use of existing public or commercial data sets; (2) integrate multiple sources of geospatial information in innovative ways; (3) include funds or in-kind contributions from non-Federal sources; (4) involve the participation of commercial entities that process raw or lightly processed data, often merging that data with other geospatial information, to create data products that have significant value added to the original data; and (5) taken together demonstrate as diverse a set of public sector applications as possible.Requires the Administrator to seek opportunities to assist: (1) in the development of commercial applications potentially available from the remote sensing industry; and (2) State, local, regional, and tribal agencies in applying remote sensing and geospatial information technologies for growth management.Limits the provision of assistance for such projects under this Act to three years.Requires each grant recipient to transmit a report to the Administrator on the results of the project and to conduct at least one workshop for potential users to disseminate the lessons learned from the project as widely as feasible.Directs the Administrator to: (1) establish an advisory committee to monitor the program; (2) transmit to Congress an independent evaluation of program effectiveness; (3) ensure that project results are retrievable through an Internet-accessible database; (4) establish an educational outreach program to increase awareness at institutions of higher education and State, local, and tribal agencies of the potential applications of remote sensing and other geospatial information; and (5) study and report to Congress on the effect of remote sensing imagery costs on potential State, local, regional, and tribal agency applications.Authorizes appropriations."
