Makes this Act inapplicable to any civil action in State court against a teacher in which all parties are citizens of the State, if it enacts a statute electing that this Act not apply.Provides that no teacher in a school shall be liable, with specified exceptions, for harm caused by an act or omission on behalf of the school if the teacher was acting within the scope of employment or responsibilities relating to providing educational services. Limits punitive damages and liability for specified non-economic loss."
