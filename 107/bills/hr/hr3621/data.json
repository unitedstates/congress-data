    "text": "Port Security and Terrorism Prevention Act - Amends the Ports and Waterways Safety Act to establish a National Maritime Security Advisory Committee to advise, consult with, and make recommendations to the Secretary of Transportation on ways to enhance the security and safety of U.S. ports, including matters related to maritime and port security and safety.Directs the Secretary to develop standards and procedures for conducting initial security evaluations and port vulnerability assessments.Requires the Secretary to carry out a demonstration project to assist the Port of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in the development of a security assessment methodology (SAM), and a training program to implement it, in order to assess the ability of a port to detect and prevent terrorist or criminal activity.Requires the establishment of local seaport security committees, among other things, to assist in the review of port vulnerability assessments and maritime security plans for each local port authority, waterfront facility operator, or operator of a public or commercial structure located within or adjacent to a marine environment.Sets forth requirements calling for: (1) the issuance of regulations establishing requirements for submission of maritime facility security plans that are adequate to safeguard the public and improve the response to threats of crime and terrorism, including designation of controlled access areas in maritime facility plans for waterfront facilities and restrictions limiting access to security-sensitive information; (2) screening of and background checks for persons having access to such areas and information; (3) enhanced maritime domain awareness; (4) an assessment of the effectiveness of security measures maintained at foreign ports that serve U.S. vessels, from which foreign vessels serve the United States, or that pose a high risk of danger to U.S. ports, U.S. citizens, U.S. vessels, or other U.S. interests; (4) dissemination of port security program information to port authorities and marine terminal operators in other countries, including the development of measures to protect the security of U.S. ports from risks related to vessels that arrive from foreign ports that do not maintain an acceptable level of security; (5) the development of maritime security professional training standards (including the establishment of a Maritime Security Institute in Louisiana); (6) the provision of grants to public and private entities for certain construction or acquisition of security infrastructure projects; and (7) other specified maritime safety and security related measures, including penalties for the destruction of or interference with vessels or maritime facilities."
