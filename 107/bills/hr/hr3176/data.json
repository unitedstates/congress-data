Requires such protocols to be : (1) specific to the hazardous agent involved (unless the agent has no unique characteristics); and (2) uniformly applied through coordination with emergency response personnel, dissemination of appropriate medical information, testing, treatment, and decontamination. Requires differentiated responses for intentional (as opposed to accidental) releases."
