Directs the Coordinator of Education of Homeless Children and Youth in each State to identify schools or programs that so segregate, and provide technical assistance and support to them in removing barriers and promptly integrating.Requires schools to: (1) enroll immediately any homeless child or youth seeking enrollment, even if the records normally required for enrollment cannot be produced; (2) immediately contact the school such child or youth last attended to obtain academic and other records; and (3) promptly refer any such child or youth who needs immunizations or immunization or health records to the liaison for assistance in obtaining them.Requires local education agencies (LEAs) to coordinate their services (including expedited assistance) with agencies responsible for sheltering homeless families and youth. Requires local liaisons to ensure that: (1) homeless children and youth are identified by school personnel and through coordination with other agencies; and (2) enrollment disputes are mediated in a prescribed way.Makes the school of origin the default interpretation of the best interest of the child regarding school placement, unless this is contrary to the wishes of the child's parents or guardians, or contrary to an unaccompanied youth's wishes.Requires LEAs that seek to receive such funds to conduct an assessment of the educational and related needs of homeless children and youth.Directs the Secretary of Education to create and disseminate a public notice of the educational rights of homeless children and youth."
