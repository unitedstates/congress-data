Recognizes and protects in perpetuity the Pueblo of Sandia's rights and interests in such Area.Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary), acting through the Forest Service, to continue to administer the Area as National Forest System lands.Sets forth the rights and interests of the Pueblo in such Area, including free and unrestricted access for traditional and cultural uses (except as they conflict with the Wilderness Act and Federal wildlife protection laws).Requires the United States to compensate the Pueblo as if it held fee title interest in the affected portion if Congress: (1) diminishes the Wilderness and National Forest designation of the Area by authorizing a prohibited use in all or any portion of it; or (2) permanently denies the Pueblo access for any traditional and cultural uses in all or any portion of the Area.Limits the Pueblo's rights and interest in the Area to exclude certain activities, including any right to sell, grant, lease, convey, encumber or exchange lands in the Area.Specifies allocation of criminal and civil jurisdiction over such Area among the Pueblo, New Mexico, and the United States.Extinguishes all Pueblo claims not specifically recognized within this Act.Declares that the Pueblo, the County of Bernalillo, New Mexico, and any person who owns or has owned property inside the exterior boundaries of the Area, and incurred cost as a result of participating in the case of Pueblo of Sandia v. Babbitt, may apply for reimbursement."
