Allows the Secretary of Defense, as part of such submission, to explain to Congress the military necessity for further base closures and realignments.Requires the Secretary to amend the criteria to be used in making recommendations to develop a list of those installations to be excluded from the closure and realignment process.Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary and the Commission should consider military force jointness when performing their base closure and realignment duties.Requires the Secretary, before preparing a list of recommended closures or realignments, to submit a list of core military installations considered absolutely essential to the national defense that should not be considered for closure which shall contain not more than 50 percent of the military installations inside the United States. Requires the Commission to consider such list, to determine whether there exists a military necessity for further base closures, and to submit its recommendations to the President for approval.Requires the Secretary to publish and transmit to the congressional defense committees and the Commission a final list of installations recommended for closure or realignment. Provides for presidential approval or disapproval, and eventual implementation, of such list. Directs the Commission to serve as an ombudsman during implementation."
