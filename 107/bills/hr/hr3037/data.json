    "text": "Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Investment Act of 2001 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a National Electric System Benefits Board, which in turn shall establish the\" National Electric System Benefits Fund\" to provide matching funds to States for the support of State system benefit programs relating to: (1) renewable energy sources; (2) assistance to low-income households in meeting home energy needs; (3) energy conservation and efficiency; or (4) research and development.Requires each retail electric supplier to submit annually to the Secretary renewable energy credits equal to the required annual percentage of the supplier's total kilowatt-hour sales to end-use customers in the preceding calendar year. Prescribes the amount of electricity which each supplier shall generate each year by renewable energy sources according to a mandatory renewable energy timetable. Prescribes guidelines for a program to issue, monitor the sale or exchange of, and track renewable energy credits.Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to mandate that a retail electric supplier, upon request, shall make net metering service available to any retail electric consumer that it currently serves or solicits for service.Instructs the Secretary to establish and promulgate a disclosure system that enables retail consumers to compare retail electric service offerings knowledgeably. Grants the Secretary full access to the records of all generation facilities, electricity wholesalers, and retail companies."
