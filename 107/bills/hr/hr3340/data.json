Applies such provisions with respect to justices and judges of the United States, bankruptcy and magistrate judges, Court of Federal Claims judges, judges of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, and members of the uniformed services who are enrolled in FERS.(Sec. 2) Amends the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 to authorize appropriations for FY 2003 through 2007 for the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board) and the Office of Special Counsel.(Sec. 3) Repeals the requirement that the Special Counsel return any documents and other matter provided by a Federal employee, former employee, or applicant who made a disclosure of a violation of law or of waste, fraud, or abuse when the Special Counsel does not transmit the information to the head of the agency which the information concerns.(Sec. 4) Deems any period of enrollment under a health benefits plan administered by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation before the effective date of this Act to be a period of enrollment in a Federal health benefits plan for purposes of the administration of Federal health benefits coverage. Allows any individual who, as of the enrollment eligibility date, is covered by a Corporation-administered plan to enroll in an approved Federal health benefits plan for continued coverage after such date, including individuals currently under a continued coverage period and unmarried dependent children. Defines \"enrollment eligibility date\" to mean the last day on which coverage under a health benefits plan administered by the Corporation is available.Requires the: (1) Corporation to transfer to the Employees Health Benefits Fund amounts necessary for reimbursement for the costs of such continued coverage; and (2) Office of Personnel Management to provide for a period of notice and open enrollment for such coverage."
