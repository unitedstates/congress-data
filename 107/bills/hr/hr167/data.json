    "text": "Amends the Internal Revenue Code to permit: (1) annual carryover of up to $3000 of unused benefits under cafeteria plans or flexible spending or similar arrangements; and (2) in lieu of a carryover, such amount to be rolled over as nontaxable income when transferred to certain retirement plans, a medical savings account, an education individual retirement account, or health care reimbursement rollover account. Authorizes an annual cost-of-living adjustment to the $3000 limit.Exempts a health care reimbursement rollover account from Federal income tax unless such account ceases to be that type of account. Subjects such account to taxation on unrelated business income. Outlines account qualification requirements. Considers as nontaxable income any amounts paid out of such accounts when used exclusively for qualified medical expenses, while considering as taxable any amounts used otherwise. Excludes account funds from estate taxes. Considers the transfer of such an account to a designated beneficiary as if the beneficiary were the original account holder. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to require from an account trustee appropriate reports concerning account contributions, distributions, and related matters."
