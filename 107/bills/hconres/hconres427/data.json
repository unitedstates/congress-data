    "text": "Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should: (1) direct the U.S. Commissioners to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas to make Atlantic marlin conservation their highest priority; (2) encourage countries that fish in Commission regulatory areas to make every effort to end illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing, including fishing that is not in compliance with Commission conservation recommendations especially with regard to Atlantic marlin mortality; (3) make full use of all appropriate diplomatic mechanisms, relevant international laws and agreements, and other appropriate mechanisms to ensure Commission compliance with conservation recommendations for all species under the Commission's management authority, including Atlantic marlin; and (4) encourage the Commission to adopt conservation recommendations authorizing the use of enforceable measures, including World Trade Organization-consistent trade measures and imposition of an import embargo, to prevent such nations that fish in the Commission regulatory area from taking actions that would undermine the effectiveness of conservation recommendations of the Commission.Declares that, if any vessel of a nation fishes in the Atlantic Ocean without complying with the Commission's conservation recommendations, such fishing should be considered to diminish the effectiveness of international fishery conservation recommendations and, therefore, such nation should be considered to be subject to import embargo under the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975 and certifiable under the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967."
