Expresses the sense of Congress that all procurement and research and development funds for the B-1 aircraft program in the FY 2002 budget for the Department of Defense should be reallocated to the Operations and Maintenance account for the Air National Guard, to be available for the continued operation of the 33 aircraft proposed to be retired."
