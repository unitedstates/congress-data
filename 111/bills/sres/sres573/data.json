Reaffirms the Senate's commitment to stand with the people of Somalia who aspire to a future free of terrorism and violence through political reconciliation. Recognizes the important work being done by the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). Calls on: (1) the Transitional Federal Government in Somalia to cease any use of child soldiers and renew its commitment to political reconciliation; and (2) regional governments and parties, particularly the government of Eritrea, to play a productive role in helping to bring peace to Somalia. Welcomes the President's efforts to bring greater focus and resources toward the situation in Somalia. Urges the President to develop a comprehensive strategy to ensure that all U.S. humanitarian, diplomatic, political, and counterterrorism programs in Somalia and the wider Horn of Africa are coordinated toward the long-term goal of establishing stability, respect for human rights, and functional, inclusive governance in Somalia."
