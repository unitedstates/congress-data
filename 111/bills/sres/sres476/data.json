Honors: (1) the late President of Poland Lech Kaczynski and all the Poles who perished in the April crash; and (2) the more than 22,000 massacred Polish government officials, military officers, and civilians. Supports the Polish people as they restore leadership in the institutions of the government of Poland that were impacted by the April crash. Requests that the Secretary of the Senate transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to the Ambassador of Poland to the United States."
