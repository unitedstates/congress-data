Urges the surrounding countries to: (1) refrain from exercising destabilizing interference in Iraq's internal affairs; and (B) allow the Iraqi people to determine their own future. Calls for the timely formation of an inclusive post-election Iraqi government. Expresses gratitude to the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces, the Foreign Service, and other federal government agencies for their service and heroism in Iraq.
