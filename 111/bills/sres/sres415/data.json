Notes that it is the right of the people of the Islamic Republic of Iran to peacefully assemble and to express their opinions without intimidation and violence. Supports freedom of speech and judicial due process in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Expresses concern over the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran's suppression of its citizens through censorship, imprisonment, and violence and denounces the atmosphere of impunity in Iran for those who employ intimidation or violence to suppress freedoms of speech, expression, assembly, and the press. Calls upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to observe the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and abide by U.N. General Assembly resolutions. Communicates deep concern that, despite the Islamic Republic of Iran's standing invitation to all thematic special procedures mandate holders, it has not fulfilled any requests from those special mechanisms to visit the country in four years and has not answered numerous communications from those special mechanisms. Encourages the U.N. Human Rights Council to fully examine these issues during its Universal Periodic Review of the Islamic Republic of Iran on February 15, 2010."
