Exempts from such requirements: (1) any information determined to be confidential by the CRS Director or the head of a department or agency that provided the information to CRS; and (2) documents, other than those described in clauses (1) through (3), that are the product of a congressional research request.Allows the Sergeant at Arms, in consultation with the CRS Director, to revise the information made publicly available by removing information concerning CRS employees, removing material that may infringe copyright protection, and making necessary changes to ensure accuracy and currency. Requires access to the information made available pursuant to this resolution through Senate committee and Member websites. Directs the Sergeant-at-Arms to ensure that such websites provide the same capability to find the cited CRS information as the CRS website. Makes the Sergeant at Arms responsible for maintaining and updating the information and for establishing a database within six months after adoption of this resolution."
