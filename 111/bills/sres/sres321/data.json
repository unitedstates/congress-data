    "text": "Commemorates the lives and work of Father Ignacio Ellacuria, Father Ignacio Martin-Baro, Father Segundo Montes, Father Amando Lopez, Father Juan Ramon Moreno, Father Joaquin Lopez y Lopez, Julia Elba Ramos, and Celina Mariset Ramos on the 20th anniversary of their deaths on November 16, 1989, at the Universidad Centroamericana Jose Simeon Canas (UCA) located in San Salvador, El Salvador. Extends sympathy to the families, friends, colleagues, and religious communities of the 6 Jesuit priests and 2 laywomen. Recognizes the continuing academic, spiritual, and social contributions of the UCA in San Salvador, El Salvador. Commends U.S. Jesuit colleges and universities for their solidarity with the UCA and annual remembrances of the Jesuit martyrs. Acknowledges the role played by the Speaker's Task Force on El Salvador, Representative John Joseph Moakley, the Jesuit leadership of the UCA, and the Salvadoran judicial investigation and convictions in advancing negotiations to end the war, such that the deaths of the Jesuit martyrs and laywomen contributed directly to achieving the peace to which they had dedicated their lives. Calls upon the people of the United States, academic institutions, and religious congregations to participate in events commemorating the 20th anniversary of the martyrdom of the 6 Jesuit priests and 2 laywomen. Recognizes that, while significant progress has been made during the post-war period, social and economic hardships persist among many sectors of Salvadoran society. Calls upon the President, the Secretary of State, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and other federal departments and agencies to support and collaborate with the government of El Salvador and public, private, nongovernmental, and religious organizations in efforts to reduce poverty and hunger and to promote educational opportunity, human rights, the rule of law, and social equity for the people of El Salvador."
