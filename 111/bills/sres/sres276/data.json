Encourages: (1) businesses, individuals, governments, the public health community, and health care providers to work together to promote the awareness of and reduce the incidence of falls among older people in the United States; (2) state health departments to use their leadership to reduce injuries and injury-related health care costs by collaborating with colleagues, organizations, and individuals to reduce falls among older adults; and (3) experts in the field of fall prevention to share best practices. Urges the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to continue developing and evaluating interventions to prevent falls among older adults that can be used in effective community-based fall prevention programs."
