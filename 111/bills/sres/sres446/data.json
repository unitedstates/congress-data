Encourages the President to work with: (1) international partners and Treaty states to promote the Model Additional Protocol to all Safeguards Agreements as the global standard for safeguards and a requirement for nuclear commerce; and (2) other Treaty states to strengthen compliance and enforcement mechanisms and develop collective responses in the U.N. Security Council and other multilateral fora to any notification of Treaty withdrawal."
