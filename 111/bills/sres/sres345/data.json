Urges the President, in coordination with leaders from the European Union (EU) and the African Union (AU), to consider punitive measures that could be taken against senior officials in Guinea complicit in the violence and the atrocities against women and other gross human rights violations. Encourages the President to remain engaged in the political situation in Guinea and to convey that the blatant abuse of women will not be tolerated. Calls on President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso to ensure that Captain Camara does not return to Guinea. Recognizes: (1) that the first steps set forth in the Joint Declaration of Ouagadougou have been initiated with the naming of a prime minister and urges all parties to continue to adhere to the agreement; and (2) the importance of the multilateral observer mission to help ensure peace and security in Guinea during the transition period."
