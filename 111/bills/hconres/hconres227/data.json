Calls for recognition of: (1) national and community organizations and private sector supporters for their work in promoting awareness about urban violent crimes and in assisting victims, families, and survivors of such crimes; (2) public safety, law enforcement, and health professionals for their efforts to combat urban violent crime; and (3) victim advocates and criminal justice professionals for their work in establishing alternatives to incarceration and rehabilitation programs for offenders and victims alike. Recommends that national and community organizations, private businesses, colleges and universities, and the media: (1) promote awareness of violent urban crimes and strategies to decrease the incidence of these crimes; and (2) support the goals and ideals of National Urban Crimes Awareness Week."
