    "text": "Reverse Mortgage Elder Protection Act - Amends the Truth in Lending Act to prohibit a creditor from taking an application for a reverse mortgage unless the creditor has provided the applicant with: (1) a specified written cautionary statement before the applicant receives any counseling regarding reverse mortgages; (2) a specified written checklist before meeting with a counseling agency about reverse mortgages; and (3) a referral to a housing counseling agency for reverse mortgage counseling approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Requires a counseling agency to provide the same kind of written checklist to a consumer that seeks counseling before requesting a loan application for a reverse mortgage. Prohibits a creditor from either accepting a final application for a reverse mortgage, or from assessing any related fees, unless the creditor has received from the consumer or the consumer's authorized representative: (1) a written certification that the consumer has received counseling regarding reverse mortgages from a HUD-approved agency; and (2) a copy of the prescribed checklist signed by the agency counselor and by the consumer."
