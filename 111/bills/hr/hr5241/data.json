Requires the Commission to evaluate: (1) current and future impact of the oil disaster on the environment, economy, and public health; (2) the adequacy of the response to the oil disaster; (3) the implications of the oil disaster, and any risk of other such disasters, for offshore oil and gas activities by the United States; and (4) the availability and accuracy of baseline data against which the impact of the oil disaster may be measured. Requires the Commission to develop recommendations to: (1) improve the response to the oil disaster, including through modification of proposed plans to mitigate and monitor its impact; and (2) minimize the risk and mitigate the impact of future such disasters (including changes to federal law and regulations and improvements in industry practices). Sets forth powers of the Commission, including subpoena powers."
