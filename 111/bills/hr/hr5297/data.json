Allows increments of loan guarantees to different borrowers that are so divided to be included in the same pool. (Sec. 1118) Expresses the sense of Congress that the SBA Administrator should establish a website that: (1) lists SBA lenders and provides loan rate information, and (2) allows prospective borrowers to compare rates on SBA-guaranteed loans. (Sec. 1119) Amends the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to terminate the authority of the Administrator regarding the Secondary Market Guarantee Authority two years after the date of the first sale of a pool of first lien position 504 loans guaranteed to a third-party investor.

Requires each qualified issuer to establish a risk-share pool, capitalized by contributions from eligible community development financial institution participants of an amount equal to 3% of the guaranteed amount outstanding on the such notes and bonds.

Requires the Associate Administrator to establish annual goals. Directs the Associate Administrator to appoint at least one trade financial specialist within the SBA to oversee international loan programs and assist SBA employees with trade finance issues. Directs the SBA Administrator to: (1) establish an export and trade counseling certification program for employees of lead small business development centers and lead women's business centers; and (2) ensure that each lead small business development center has at least 10% of its employees (with a minimum of 5 employees) certified in providing export assistance.

Requires recommendations to Congress on how to eliminate gaps between the supply of and demand for export finance specialists in the 15 states with the greatest volume of exports as well as in the 15 states with the lowest volume of exports. (Sec. 1206) Increases from $1.75 million to $4.5 million the total amount of a small business loan outstanding and committed (by participation or otherwise) to the borrower from the business loan and investment fund. Increases from $1.25 million to $4 million the limit on the use of such a loan for working capital, supplies, or financings. Caps SBA participation in an international trade loan at 90%. Authorizes the SBA to make a guaranteed loan for working capital that will allow an eligible small business concern engaged in or adversely affected by international trade to improve its competitive position. Allows such a loan to be secured by a second lien position on the property or equipment financed by the loan or on other assets of the small business concern, if the lien gives adequate assurance of the payment of the loan. (Currently, a first lien position or first mortgage on the property, equipment, or other business assets is required.) Names the foreign market development loan guarantee program the Export Working Capital Program, allowing a maximum loan guarantee of $5 million. Makes eligible to participate in the Preferred Lenders Program any lender participating in the Delegated Authority Lender Program of the Export-Import Bank of the United States.

Subtitle C: Small Business Contracting - Part I: Contract Bundling - (Sec. 1312) Amends the Small Business Act to require each federal agency to include in each solicitation for any multiple award contract above the agency's substantial bundling threshold a provision soliciting bids from any responsible source, including responsible small business concerns and teams or joint ventures of small business concerns.

Requires the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy to report triennially to certain congressional committees regarding procurement center representatives and commercial market representatives, including the identification of each area to which the SBA has assigned such a representative. Directs the Comptroller General to report to Congress on the procurement center representative program. Instructs the Administrator to implement a 3-year pilot electronic procurement center representative program. (Sec. 1313) Directs the head of each federal agency to ensure that its decisions regarding consolidation of contract requirements are made with a view to providing small business concerns with appropriate opportunities to participate as prime contractors and subcontractors. Prohibits a federal agency head from carrying out an acquisition strategy that includes a consolidation of contract requirements with a value of more than $2 million unless the senior procurement executive or Chief Acquisition Officer first conducts market research, identifying alternative contracting approaches involving a lesser degree of consolidation of contract requirements, and certifying that steps will be taken to include small business concerns in the acquisition strategy. Authorizes a senior procurement executive or Chief Acquisition Officer to determine that an acquisition strategy involving a consolidation of contract requirements is necessary and justified if the benefits of the acquisition strategy substantially exceed the benefits of alternative contracting approaches. (Sec. 1314) Directs the Administrator to establish a Small Business Teaming Pilot Program of grants to eligible organizations to assist and guide to teams or joint ventures of small business concerns seeking to compete for larger procurement contracts. Authorizes appropriations for FY2010-FY2015.

Part III: Acquisition Process - (Sec. 1331) Amends the Small Business Act to direct the Administrator and the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy to establish regulatory guidance under which federal agencies may, at their discretion, set aside part or parts of a multiple award contract, and reserve contract awards, for small business concerns, including the subcategories of small business concerns.

Part IV: Small Business Size and Status Integrity - (Sec. 1341) States a presumption that, in every contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, cooperative research and development agreement, or grant which is classified as intended for award to small business concerns, there shall be a loss to the United States based on the total amount expended on such instrument whenever a non-small business concern willfully sought and received the award by misrepresentation. (Sec. 1342) Requires each certified small business concern to certify its size and small business status annually by means of a confirming entry on the SBA Online Representations and Certifications Application database.

(Sec. 1345) Directs Comptroller General to study the mentor-protege program for small business concerns participating in certain SBA programs, as well as other relationships and strategic alliances pairing a larger business and a small business concern partner to gain access to federal government contracts, to determine whether the programs and relationships are effectively supporting the goal of increasing the participation of small business concerns in federal contracting. Subtitle D: Small Business Management and Counseling Assistance - (Sec. 1401) Authorizes the Administrator, upon request by an intermediary, to waive the requirement to obtain non-federal funds for a fiscal year, including successive fiscal years. Prohibits the Administrator from waiving the requirement to obtain such funds if granting the waiver would undermine the credibility of the microloan program. (Sec. 1402) Authorizes the Administrator to make grants to small business development centers to provide targeted technical assistance to small business concerns seeking access to capital or credit, federal procurement opportunities, energy efficiency audits to reduce energy bills, opportunities to export products or provide services to foreign customers, adopting, making innovations in, and using broadband technologies, or other assistance.
