    "text": "Wildlife Corridors Conservation Act of 2010 - Establishes a National Fish and Wildlife Habitat and Corridors Information Program for the purposes of: (1) supporting states and Indian tribes in the development of a geographic information system database of fish and wildlife habitat and corridors that would inform planning and development decisions; and (2) facilitating the use of such databases, including the Habitat and Corridors Information System, by federal, state, local, and tribal decisionmakers to incorporate qualitative and quantitative information on such habitat and corridors at the earliest possible stage. Requires the development of a Habitat and Corridors Information System, as described in this Act. Bars certain information regarding the human remains of persons of Indian ancestry, or traditional or cultural resources, items, uses, or activities from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), if specified determinations are made regarding such disclosure. Directs the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to establish a Wildlife Corridors Stewardship and Protection Grant Program to fund projects by eligible applicants to advance important wildlife corridor stewardship and protection. States that it is U.S. policy, where appropriate, to manage important wildlife corridors in a manner that will preserve and protect their natural condition. Includes important wildlife corridors as \"areas of critical environmental concern.\" Requires coordination of important wildlife corridors under National Forest System land and resource management plans. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA): (1) under the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, in determining the amount and rate of payments involving foregone income of a producer, to accord great significance to a practice that promotes wildlife corridor management; and (2) in carrying out any USDA-administered conservation program, to encourage the stewardship of habitat in important wildlife corridors and the use of conservation practices that benefit important wildlife corridors identified as such by a state."
