    "text": "Clean Car Rebate Act of 2009 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a refundable tax credit for the purchase of new fuel-efficient passenger motor vehicles. Allows a $1,000 tax credit for vehicles purchased in 2009 that achieve a mile per gallon (mpg) rating of 28, and increases such credit amount to $2,500 for an mpg rating of more than 32. Increases required mpg ratings in 2010 and directs the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to prescribe mpg ratings for such credit for taxable years beginning after 2010 to achieve specified fuel economy goals by 2015. Terminates such credit after December 31, 2014. Directs the Secretary to establish a program for making advance payments of credit amounts to individuals who purchase vehicles that meet the mpg ratings established by this Act."
