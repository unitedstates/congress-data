Requires such programs to provide students with camp activities geared toward: (1) reducing childhood obesity through increased physical activity and healthy lifestyle choices; (2) strengthening high school graduation rates by reducing summer learning loss and improving academic achievement; and (3) promoting positive youth development. Directs the Secretary to arrange for an independent evaluation of the pilot programs. Requires the Secretary to provide a grant or contract to one or more national nonprofit organizations to collect best practices from among this Act's grantees and provide grantees with training, technical assistance, and professional development."
