Permits the insured employee to elect such an alternative form of payment; but allows a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to elect settlement by any other form of payment available to the employee, regardless of the employee's election. Applies this Act only to employees who first become insured in any calendar year beginning at least three months after enactment of this Act."
