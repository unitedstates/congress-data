    "text": "Healthy Kids Act - Directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to promulgate rules that define advertising, promoting, and marketing directed at children and that specify categories of foods and beverages for which advertising, promotion, or marketing directed at children shall be an abusive, unfair, or deceptive act or practice in or affecting commerce. Repeals the restriction on FTC rulemaking authority relating to children's advertising. Amends the Children's Television Act of 1990 to direct the FTC to revise its regulations with respect to children's television programming to limit the amount of time devoted to advertising foods and beverages of low nutritional value. Amends the Public Health Service Act to: (1) establish within the Office of Public Health and Science of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) the Office of Childhood Overweight and Obesity Prevention and Treatment (Office); and (2) direct the Secretary to establish and carry out a matching grant program to assist the Office in gathering data on childhood obesity and to carry out demonstration programs to reduce the incidence of childhood obesity. Amends the Childhood Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 to include the Office in providing technical assistance to schools and educational agencies for developing and implementing local wellness policy. Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to require the Secretary to prescribe regulations for identifying healthy and unhealthy foods and beverages for children in schools and service institutions. Amends titles XIX (Medicaid) and XXI (State Children's Health Insurance Program) (CHIP, formerly known as SCHIP) of the Social Security Act to include in early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services obesity prevention, nutritional counseling, and other services for obesity."
