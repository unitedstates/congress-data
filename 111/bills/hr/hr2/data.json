    "text": "Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 - (Sec. 3) Makes the amendments made by this Act effective on April 1, 2009, regardless of whether final regulations have been promulgated to carry them out.Allows certain state plans under titles XIX (Medicaid) or XXI (State Children's Health Insurance Program) (SCHIP, referred to in this Act as CHIP) of the Social Security Act (SSA) that require state legislation to meet additional requirements imposed by this Act additional time to make required plan changes.Provides for coordination of CHIP funding for FY2009.Title I: Financing - Subtitle A: Funding - (Sec. 101) Amends SSA title XXI to reauthorize the CHIP program through FY2013 at increased levels.

Sets the minimum income eligibility level for children under age 19 at 200% of the poverty line applicable to a family of the size involved. Provides for automatic enrollment for children born to women receiving pregnancy-related assistance.(Sec. 112) Provides for phase-out of CHIP coverage for nonpregnant childless adults, leaving states an option to apply for a Medicaid waiver to continue coverage for such adults. Requires extension of an expiring waiver at state request, but only through calendar 2009 and only for childless adults who were covered through that year. Prescribes terms and conditions for coverage of parents of targeted low-income children.Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on whether: (1) the coverage of a parent, a caretaker relative, or a legal guardian of a targeted low-income child under a state CHIP health plan increases the enrollment of, or the quality of care for, children; and (2) such parents, relatives, and legal guardians who enroll in such a plan are more likely to enroll their children in such a plan or in a state Medicaid plan.(Sec. 113) Eliminates counting Medicaid child presumptive eligibility costs against CHIP allotment.(Sec. 114) Limits the matching rate for states that propose to cover children with effective family income that exceeds 300% of the poverty line. Exempts from this denial (grandfathers) any state that already has an approved state plan amendment or waiver to provide such expenditures. (Sec. 115) Allows the Secretary, at state option, to provide the state with the federal medical assistance percentage determined for the state for Medicaid with respect to certain expenditures or otherwise made to provide medical assistance under Medicaid to a child who could be covered by the state under CHIP.Allows a state to cover: (1) certain individuals and thereby receive federal financial participation for medical assistance for them under Medicaid; or (2) receive such federal financial participation for children made eligible as a result of an income or resource eligibility level expansion.Title II: Outreach and Enrollment - Subtitle A: Outreach and Enrollment Activities - (Sec. 201) Amends SSA title XXI to direct the Secretary to award grants during FY2009-FY2013 for outreach and enrollment efforts to increase the enrollment and participation of eligible children under CHIP and Medicaid.Makes appropriations for FY2009-FY2013.

Prescribes civil and criminal penalties for improper disclosure of such information.Directs the Secretary to enter into agreements necessary to permit a state that elects the Express Lane option to receive data directly relevant to determining eligibility and the correct amount of benefits under CHIP or Medicaid from: (1) the National Directory of New Hires; and (2) data regarding enrollment in insurance that may help to facilitate outreach and enrollment under the state Medicaid and CHIP plans and such other programs as the Secretary may specify.Subtitle B: Reducing Barriers to Enrollment - (Sec. 211) Gives states the option, as an alternative to the current documentation requirement, to verify a declaration of U.S. citizenship or nationality for purposes of Medicaid or CHIP eligibility through verification of a name and Social Security number with the Commissioner of Social Security.

Allows a state child health plan, at state option, to waive a waiting period for a child provided dental-only supplemental coverage.
