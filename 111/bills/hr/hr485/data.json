Amends the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act to include within the scope of such Act (including identification/reporting and sanction provisions) persons involved in the transshipment (as defined by this Act) of certain goods, services, or technology. Establishes restrictions on nuclear cooperation with a country that is assisting the nuclear program of, or transferring advanced conventional weapons or missiles to, Iran, North Korea, or Syria. Provides for exclusion from the United States (with a discretionary national security waiver by the President) of an alien who is a senior government official of a foreign government or a corporate principal or significant shareholder of a foreign person identified as involved in proliferation activities respecting Iran, North Korea, or Syria. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) deny a foreign tax credit to a taxpayer engaged in business activity with Iran that is prohibited by U.S. law; and (2) set forth income tax provisions respecting a foreign corporation engaged in business activity with Iran that is prohibited by U.S. law. Establishes the Compensation for Former United States Hostages in Iran Fund."
