Directs the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to establish the More Books for Africa Program to facilitate the donation and distribution of not fewer than 3 million text and library books per year to African schools, libraries, and community learning centers in partnership with U.S.-based entities. Provides that: (1) Program books may come only from unrestricted donations from citizens, not-for-profits, educational institutions, libraries, and private companies; (2) the Program shall encourage partnerships with faith-based organizations, community organizations, K-12 educational institutions, and private companies; (3) the Program shall encourage partnerships with African ministries of education; and (4) the Program shall encourage U.S. Ambassadors to African countries to make the establishment of libraries and donations of books to schools on behalf of the United States a priority. Provides for Program monitoring."
