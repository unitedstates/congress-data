Allows any U.S. citizen or national that is enrolled in a postsecondary school to commence a civil action against a school or state education official to enforce their compliance with this Act's requirement and obtain appropriate relief, including the in-state tuition rate. Prohibits federal agencies from providing financial assistance to postsecondary schools that provide benefits to illegal aliens in contravention of this Act."
