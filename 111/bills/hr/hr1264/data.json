Defines windstorm as any hurricane, tornado, cyclone, typhoon, or other wind event. Restricts multiperil coverage to areas (or their subdivisions) where an appropriate public body has adopted adequate mitigation measures, including effective enforcement provisions, which the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) finds are consistent with the criteria for construction described in the International Code Council building codes relating to wind mitigation. Prohibits provision of multiperil coverage to any structure (or related personal property ) covered, at any time, by flood insurance under the Act. Requires maintenance of flood insurance coverage under this Act as a prerequisite to windstorm coverage of any structure (or related personal property). States that separate windstorm coverage only covers losses from physical damages from windstorm. Prescribes the nature and terms of coverage and actuarial rates. (Sec. 3) Prohibits duplicative coverage. (Sec. 4) Prohibits new multiperil coverage for property declared by a governmental authority to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances intended to reduce windstorm damage. (Sec. 5) Instructs the Director to: (1) carry out studies and investigations to determine measures for wind hazard prevention; and (2) provide technical assistance to state, interstate, and local governmental agencies to encourage adoption and enforcement of laws, regulations, and ordinances relating to the orderly development and use of areas subject to damage from windstorm risks, and zoning building codes, building permits, and subdivision and other building restrictions for such areas."
