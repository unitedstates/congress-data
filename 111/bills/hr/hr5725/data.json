Appropriates additional amounts to the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund to compensate for losses in revenue resulting from the revision of the formula for including social security benefits in gross income. Amends title II (Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Benefits) of the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a procedure for allowing Medicare beneficiaries to waive Medicare entitlements and be automatically enrolled in the Medicare Alternative Voucher Program established by this Act."
