Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Director of NIH, in awarding grants, to give: (1) priority to entities that serve populations disproportionately impacted by asthma; and (2) consideration to an adequate national understanding of asthma prevalence. Authorizes additional appropriations for FY2010-FY2014 to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to develop a National Asthma Action Plan and to fund a report to Congress by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program on federal asthma activities. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to: (1) collaborate with state and local health departments to conduct activities to inform and educate the public regarding asthma; (2) conduct asthma surveillance activities to collect data on the prevalence and severity of asthma, the effectiveness of public heath asthma intervention, and the quality of asthma management; and (3) compile and annually publish data on childhood and adult asthma."
