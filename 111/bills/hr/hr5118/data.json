Prohibits, if such emission data is excluded: (1) the Administrator from finding that a state has failed to enforce, or that a person has violated, a state implementation plan (SIP) for national primary or secondary ambient air quality standards as a result of such emissions; or (2) a state from finding that a person has violated, or from bringing an enforcement action for violation of, a SIP for such standards as a result of such emissions. Prohibits: (1) the Administrator from requiring, or a state from adopting, a smoke management plan under such Act in connection with any prescribed fire in such region; and (2) a building, structure, facility, or installation from being treated as a stationary source under new stationary source performance standards as a result of such prescribed fires. Provides that no person shall be required to obtain or modify an operating permit under Title V of the Clean Air Act in connection with such a prescribed fire."
