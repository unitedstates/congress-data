Exempts related nonmonetary remunerations meeting specified requirements from criminal penalties. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to assess and report to Congress on the effect of these safe harbors on the health system, especially the adoption of health information technology. Amends SSA title XVIII (Medicare) to except from the limitation on certain physician referrals the provision of health information technology and training services to health care professionals. Requires the Secretary to assess and report to Congress similarly on the impact of this exception on the health system, especially the adoption of health information technology."
