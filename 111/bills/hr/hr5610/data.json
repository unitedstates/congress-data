Sets as such conditions that: (1) the Commissioner receives from the state, by August 5, 2010, a request to disregard ARRA funds, jointly signed by the designated state unit that receives and disburses funds to such centers and the state's Statewide Independent Living Council; and (2) the Commissioner is not conducting a competition to establish a new center for independent living in the state with ARRA funds. Requires the distribution of funds among such centers in a state for FY2010 (except under ARRA) to be in the same proportion as the regular funds appropriated for FY2009 for such centers, disregarding any ARRA funds. Requires continued disregard of ARRA funds in the allocation of funds for such centers in FY2011 and subsequent fiscal years. Authorizes the director of the designated state unit with approval to award funds to existing centers for independent living in the state to: (1) distribute non-ARRA funds among such centers during FY2010 in the same proportion as such funds were distributed in FY2009, disregarding ARRA funds; and (2) continue disregarding ARRA funds in distributions for FY2011 and subsequent fiscal years."
