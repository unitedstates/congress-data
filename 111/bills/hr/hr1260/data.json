Defines \"effective filing date of a claimed invention\" as the filing date of the patent or the application for patent containing the claim to the invention (thus establishing a first-to-file system). Revises various other rights and requirements related to patents, including regarding: (1) damages; (2) post-grant procedures; (3) citation of prior art; and (4) inter partes reexaminations; (5) preissuance submissions by third parties; (6) venue and jurisdiction; and (7) the regulatory authority of the Patent and Trademark Office. Replaces the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. Revises provisions concerning the residency of federal circuit judges."
