Grants the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), acting through FPS, lead authority in the executive branch to carry out counterterrorism functions on federal property managed by the General Services Administration (GSA). Requires the Secretary to submit to Congress a five-year budget outlook and strategic plan for FPS. Requires annual updates. Directs the Secretary, through the Director, to: (1) conduct facility security assessments; (2) prepare a report on each assessment; and (3) give the facility security committee established for such a facility a 60-day period to review and comment on each report. Provides for the selection by GSA of recommendations for implementation. Requires: (1) the Secretary to develop minimum standards for training and annual recertification for FPS's contract guards; (2) the Director to establish a three-year pilot program in not less than three level IV facilities to test and evaluate to what extent efficiencies exist in having a federalized guard staff and to what extent such a staff provides a measurable improvement in security; and (3) the Comptroller General to monitor and review the program. Grants the Secretary a right of entry to property for which security is provided by FPS for unannounced inspections. Requires the Secretary to conduct security inspections, including unannounced inspections, of such properties. Directs the Director to publish: (1) a list of qualified vendors and products that would promote common standards of deployment of personnel and technology; (2) standards for training personnel among all FPS protected properties; and (3) best practices for utilizing items on the qualified products list. Directs the Secretary to issue and implement a list of items that are prohibited from being brought into facilities protected by FPS unless specifically authorized on a case-by-case basis."
