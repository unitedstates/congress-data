Defines the term \"health information technology\" to mean computer hardware, software, and related technology that supports the meaningful electronic health record use requirements of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act and is purchased by an eligible professional to aid in the provision of health care, including electronic medical records, but excludes information technology whose sole use is financial management, maintenance of inventory of basic supplies, or appointment scheduling. Sets loan limits at $350,000 for an individual professional and $2 million for a group of affiliated professionals. Authorizes the Administrator to impose a guarantee fee on such borrowers, but prohibits any service, processing, or other fees. Allows such loans for a period of not less than one year or more than three years. Authorizes appropriations."
