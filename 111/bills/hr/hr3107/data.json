Charter or relevant U.N. resolutions. Directs the Secretary of State to withhold specified voluntary and assessed IAEA contribution amounts. Authorizes the waiver of such withholding if: (1) the IAEA has suspended all Program assistance to such countries; or (2) the President certifies that such countries no longer pose a threat to U.S. security and allies."
