Imposes: (1) a fine of not more than $1 million and/or a prison term of up to 20 years for knowingly defrauding the United States or a provisional authority in connection with such a mission or for materially overvaluing any goods or services with the intent to defraud; (2) a fine of not more than $1 million and/or a prison term of up to 10 years for falsification or concealment, false statements, or false documents in connection with such contracts or goods or services. Grants extraterritorial federal jurisdiction over war profiteering and fraud offenses. Permits venue for the prosecution of such offenses in any district where any act in furtherance of an offense took place or where any party to a contract or provider of goods or services is located. Allows criminal forfeiture of property obtained from a war profiteering or fraud offense. Makes war profiteering and fraud a predicate offense for prosecuting money laundering and racketeering offenses."
