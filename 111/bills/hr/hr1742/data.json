    "text": "Requires the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to deploy and integrate plug-in electric drive vehicles in multiple regions. Lists as program goals: (1) to demonstrate the viability of a vehicle-based transportation system that is not overly dependent on petroleum as a fuel and contributes to lower carbon emissions than a system based on conventional vehicles; (2) to facilitate the integration of advanced vehicle technologies into electricity distribution areas to improve system performance and reliability; (3) to demonstrate the potential benefits of coordinated investments in vehicle electrification on personal mobility and a regional grid; (4) to demonstrate protocols and standards that facilitate vehicle integration into the grid; and (5) to investigate differences in each region and regulatory environment regarding best practices in implementing vehicle electrification. Authorizes the Secretary to provide financial assistance for: (1) assisting persons in the purchase of new plug-in electric drive vehicles by offsetting the incremental cost of such vehicles above the cost of comparable conventionally fueled vehicles; (2) supporting electrical charging stations for plug-in electric drive vehicles and smart grid equipment and infrastructure to facilitate the charging and integration of such vehicles; and (3) other projects to support the large-scale deployment of such vehicles in regional deployment areas. Directs the Secretary to collect and make available to the public information regarding the cost, performance, and other technical data regarding the deployment and integration of plug-in electric drive vehicles."
