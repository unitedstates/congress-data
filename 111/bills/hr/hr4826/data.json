Limits the aggregate amount of such deduction to $9,000, allowable in three annual installments of $3,000. Terminates such deduction after 2012. Requires the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) to waive any short sale waiting period requirement for certain mortgagors who refinance their mortgage in a short sale. Terminates such waiver authority on January 1, 2013."
