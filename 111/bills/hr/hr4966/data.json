Treats such stored value devices as monetary instruments. Prescribes procedures for mandatory registration of such devices with the Secretary of the Treasury. Subjects to a civil penalty noncompliance with such requirement Instructs the Secretary to: (1) prescribe regulations establishing a threshold point under which small stored value device businesses are exempt from such registration requirements; and (2) study and report to Congress on specified uses of such devices, including the extent to which they are used to provide payments related to drug trafficking and human trafficking or financial support to terror cells operating within the United States."
