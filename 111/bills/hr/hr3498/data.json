Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to permit a satellite carrier to retransmit the signals of a television broadcast station outside the station's local market directly to its subscribers if: (1) such station is a part of a network of three or more noncommercial educational broadcast stations that are licensed to a single state, political, educational, or special purpose subdivision of a state, or to a single public agency; and (2) the carrier retransmits such signal only to subscribers in a county within that state that is outside the station's local market and is not served by another in-state noncommercial educational broadcast station."
