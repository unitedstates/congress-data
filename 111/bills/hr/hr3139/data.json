(Sec. 3) Extends through FY2010 the pilot program for mitigation of severe repetitive loss properties. Repeals the termination date for, and thus makes permanent, the authority of the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide assistance to any state or community. (Sec. 4) Extends eligibility for flood insurance at specified maximum premium rates to any community that has made adequate progress on construction (as under current law), reconstruction, or improvement of a flood protection system which will afford flood protection for the one-hundred year frequency flood (without respect to the level of federal investment or participation). Revises the requirement that a revised Flood Insurance Rate Map be prepared for the community to delineate as Zone AR the areas of special flood hazard that result from the disaccreditation of the flood protection system. Specifies that the areas of special flood hazard may be either coastal or riverine. Revises the requirement that a community will be considered to be in the process of restoration if its flood protection system has been deemed restorable by a federal agency in consultation with the local project sponsor. Replaces a federal agency as the deeming authority with the entity or entities that own, operate, maintain, or repair the system. (Sec. 5) Instructs the FEMA Administrator to implement this Act in a manner that will not materially weaken the financial position of the National Flood Insurance Program, or increase the risk of financial liability to federal taxpayers."
