Authorizes appropriations for this loan program for FY2010-FY2015. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Administrator, to publish in the Federal Register, a plan that describes the demonstration, research, and multistate project priorities of the Department of Transportation (DOT) regarding merchant mariner recruitment, training, and retention for the three-year period following the publication of the plan. Requires the Secretary to submit copies of the plan to Congress. Authorizes the Secretary to award competitive grants to maritime training institutions to carry out demonstration projects and other eligible projects that implement DOT priorities in a way to address merchant mariner recruitment, training, and retention issues.
