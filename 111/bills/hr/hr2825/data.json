Directs the Secretary to also debar any subcontractor found to have caused or committed such actions. Requires a five-year minimum period for such a debarment. Authorizes a debarment waiver by the Secretary if it would jeopardize national security. Directs the Secretary, in the case of any defense contractor receiving a level III corrective action request from the Defense Contract Management Agency in a fiscal year, to withhold any contract award or incentive fees for that fiscal year."
