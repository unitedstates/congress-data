Authorizes the Secretary to release such flows to the extent that they would not impede or delay completion of specified measures in the Settlement or exceed existing downstream channel capacities.Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) purchase property needed to implement the Settlement; and (2) dispose of such property and deposit proceeds into the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund established in the Treasury.Declares that the Settlement satisfies and discharges the Secretary's obligations under the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992. Provides for the reintroduction of California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon into the San Joaquin River. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Bureau of Reclamation, to provide direct financial assistance to the California Water Institute to study coordination and integration of sub-regional integrated regional water management plans into a unified plan. Directs the Secretary to conduct feasibility studies on: (1) restoration of the capacity of the Friant-Kern Canal and Madera Canal; and (2) reverse flow pump-back facilities on the Friant-Kern Canal.
