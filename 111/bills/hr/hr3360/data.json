Prescribes civil and criminal penalties for persons who willfully violate such requirements. Directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to develop minimum training standards for the certification of passenger vessel security personnel, crew members, and law enforcement officials on methods for the prevention, detection, evidence preservation, and reporting of criminal activities in the international maritime environment. Prohibits a vessel carrying U.S. citizens from entering a U.S. port unless there is at least one crew member on board who has met such training and certification requirements. Subjects persons who violate such requirements to certain civil penalties. (Sec. 4) Repeals certain maritime reporting requirements. Requires the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard (CG) is operating to combine into a single annual report for FY2010 and thereafter the separate reports of the CG concerning: (1) its annual fisheries enforcement plans; and (2) steps it will take to improve significantly the detection and interdiction of illegal incursions by foreign fishing vessels into the U.S. exclusive economic zone."
