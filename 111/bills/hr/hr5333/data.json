Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary should expedite the design and manufacture of the button, as well as mechanisms to facilitate its issuance. Makes such button available retroactively to the child of any member satisfying such eligibility conditions before the enactment of this Act. Requires the Secretary to notify members with qualifying service since September 30, 2001, of the availability of the button."
