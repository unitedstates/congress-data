Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to: (1) authorize an alien who has been arrested or detained pending a removal determination to be represented by counsel (at no cost to the government); and (2) require that an alien who has been in such custody for more that 48 hours be brought for a custody determination not later than 72 hours after commencement of detention. Amends part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Social Security Act to require that state plans for foster care and adoption assistance include provisions regarding foster care children with a parent, legal guardian, or primary caregiver relative who is in immigration detainment or has been removed from the United States. Directs the Secretary of DHS to: (1) mandate vulnerable population and child welfare training for immigration enforcement personnel; and (2) ensure that immigration detention facilities take steps to preserve family unity."
