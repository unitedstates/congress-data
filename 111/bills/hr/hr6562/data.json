Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit for private investment in shared equity appreciation contracts. Amends the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to: (1) treat shared equity appreciation contracts as a consumer financial product; and (2) provide for regulatory oversight of shared equity appreciation contracts by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection."
