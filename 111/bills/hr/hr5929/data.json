Requires such improvements to include: (1) challenging and grade-appropriate academic content standards for computer science; (2) grade-appropriate assessments of computer science learning; (3) programs to increase disadvantaged students' access to computer science courses; (4) computer science teacher training programs; (5) improved certification requirements and processes for such teachers; (6) programs to ensure that computer science courses are considered an integral part of the secondary school curriculum; (7) effective computer science curricula; and (8) computer science distance learning programs. Requires states to partner with institutions of higher education (IHEs) and local educational agencies in implementing such measures. Directs the Secretary to establish a Blue Ribbon Commission on Computer Science Education to provide recommendations to the Secretary and Congress for expanding and improving computer science education. Authorizes the Secretary to award five-year grants to IHEs to improve computer science teacher training."
