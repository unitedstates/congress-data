Entitles anyone who is eligible for such monthly compensation or annuity as the survivor of a public safety officer who died on or after January 1, 1974, to: (1) have such compensation or annuity recomputed upon application submitted within 12 months after enactment of this Act; and (2) a lump-sum payment for the period between January 1, 1974, and the date as of which regular monthly compensation or survivor annuity payments are adjusted to reflect the recomputation."
