Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to terminate the status of a sponsored entrepreneur (and the alien spouse and children of such entrepreneur) if, not later than three years after the date on which such permanent resident status was conferred: (1) the sponsoring venture capitalist or investor failed to meet investment requirements; or (2) the entrepreneur failed to meet job creation, capital investment, or revenue requirements."
