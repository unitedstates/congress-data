Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) establish a permanent $3.5 million estate tax exclusion (adjusted for inflation) and a maximum estate and gift tax rate of 45% after 2010; (2) restore after 2010 the estate tax deduction for family-owned business interests and increase the amount of such deduction to $8 million (adjusted annually for inflation); and (3) exclude from the gross estate of a decedent the value of farmland used as a farm for farming purposes."
