    "text": "Troops' Soft Landing, Employment, and Rural Transportation Act - Requires that a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces who was deployed for more than 179 days for a contingency operation or a homeland defense mission be: (1) retained on active duty in the Armed Forces for 90 days after the end of the member's demobilization from a deployment; (2) allowed to use accrued leave; and (3) paid specified pay and allowances. Allows a member to be released from such retention if the member requests release after the first 15 days of the retention. Directs the Secretary of the military department concerned to provide each member so retained (and, as practicable, appropriate family members) reintegration counseling and services. Amends Internal Revenue Code work opportunity tax credit provisions, with regard to unemployed veterans living in counties where the unemployment is over a specified national threshold, to increase the credit from 40% to 50% and the maximum first-year wages which may be taken into account from $6,000 to $10,000. Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a competitive grant program to assist veterans in rural areas to travel to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities."
