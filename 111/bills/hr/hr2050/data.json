Defines as a \"novelty lighter\" a lighter that has a toy-like appearance, has entertaining audio or visual effects, or resembles in any way in form or function an item that is commonly recognized as appealing, attractive, or intended for use by children of 10 years of age or younger. Excludes from that term standard disposable and refillable lighters that are printed or decorated with logos, labels, decals, artwork, or heat shrinkable sleeves."
