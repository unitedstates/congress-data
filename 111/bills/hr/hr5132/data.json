Requires the Director to work with the private sector and appropriate federal agencies to perform needs assessments to identify and evaluate the measurement, technical standards, and conformity assessment needs required, as well as support the development of technical standards and conformance architecture, to improve the operation of emergency communication and tracking technologies."
