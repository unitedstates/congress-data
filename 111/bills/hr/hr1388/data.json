    "date": "2009-04-21", 
    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on March 26, 2009. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Serve America Act - Amends the National and Community Service Act of 1990 (NCSA) and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 (DVSA) to revise their programs and reauthorize appropriations for them through FY2014. Title I: Amendments to National and Community Service Act of 1990 - Revises under the NCSA: (1) the School-Based and Community-Based Service-Learning programs and Higher Education Innovative Programs for Community Service, also known as Learn and Serve programs; (2) National Service Trust programs, also known as AmeriCorps; (3) the Civilian Community Corps Demonstration program; and (4) the Investment for Quality and Innovation program. Subtitle A: Amendments to Subtitle A (General Provisions) - (Sec. 1101) Adds to NCSA purposes: (1) providing year-round opportunities in service-learning; (2) involving program participants in emergency and disaster preparedness, relief, and recovery; (3) increasing service opportunities for retiring professionals; (4) encouraging service by individuals age 55 or older and continued service by national service alumni; (5) focusing national service on the areas of national need such service has the capacity to address; (6) assisting social entrepreneurs and nonprofit community organizations in addressing national and local challenges; (7) leveraging federal investments to increase other public and private resources directed toward such challenges; (8) supporting institutions of higher education (IHEs) that engage students in service-learning; and (9) increasing veterans' participation in national service and assisting the families of veterans and military personnel. (Sec. 1102) Adds definitions of Alaska Native-serving institutions, approved silver scholar positions, approved summer of service positions, Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving institutions, authorizing committees, community-based entities, disadvantaged youth, Encore Service programs, Hispanic-serving institutions, historically Black colleges or universities, medically underserved populations, Native American-serving, nontribal institutions, Native Hawaiian-serving institutions, predominantly Black Institutions, principles of scientific research, qualified organizations, scientifically valid research, territories, tribally controlled colleges or universities, and veterans. Subtitle B: Amendments to Subtitle B (Learn and Serve America) - (Sec. 1201) Revises the School-Based programs for elementary and secondary school students (part of the Learn and Serve programs) to eliminate the current competitive grant portion of such programs. Requires the Corporation for National and Community Service (Corporation) to allocate appropriated funds to states, after reserving from 2% to 3% for Indian tribes and territories, pursuant to a formula that takes into account a state's share of school age youth and funds received under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). Sets a minimum grant of $75,000 per state for School-Based programs when fiscal year appropriations for the School-Based programs exceed $50 million. Authorizes grants to be used for the development of civic engagement programs dealing with our nation's history and government. Limits the Corporation's share of costs for new School-Based programs at 80% for their first year, 65% for their second year, and 50% thereafter. Permits certain schools receiving funds under title I of the ESEA to use such funds to cover their share of program costs. Increases from 5% to 6% the limit on the use of program funds for administrative costs. Eliminates the current Community-Based Learn and Serve programs. (Sec. 1202) Revises the Higher Education Innovative programs (part of the Learn and Serve programs) that award grants to IHEs and partnerships of IHEs and nonprofit organizations for the provision of community service-learning opportunities to postsecondary school students. Allows the use of grant funds for the inclusion of service-learning as a key component not only of preservice teacher education, but also of education in other fields, such as medicine, criminal justice, or public policy. Directs the Corporation, to the extent practicable, to give special consideration to applications submitted by, or partnerships that include, IHEs serving primarily low-income populations, including Alaska Native-serving institutions, Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving institutions, Hispanic-serving institutions, historically Black colleges and universities, Native American-serving, nontribal institutions, Native Hawaiian-serving institutions, predominantly Black institutions, tribally controlled colleges and universities, and community colleges serving predominantly minority populations. Requires that grantee IHEs meet the minimum requirement set by the Higher Education Act of 1965 regarding the participation of federal work-study students in community service activities. Establishes a Campuses of Service program under which the Corporation annually designates up to 25 IHEs, from among institutions nominated by state Commissions on National and Community Service (state Commissions), as recipients of funding to develop exemplary service-learning programs or disseminate them to other IHEs. (Sec. 1203) Establishes a new Learn and Serve program, Innovative Community-Based Service-Learning Programs and Research, providing grants to states, nonprofit organizations, territories, Indian tribes, IHEs, elementary or secondary schools, and local educational agencies (LEAs) to: (1) provide community service-learning opportunities to elementary and secondary, college, and graduate students; and (2) research and evaluate service-learning. Includes among allowable grant activities: (1) integrating service-learning programs into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) curricula; (2) service-learning programs focused on energy conservation, emergency and disaster preparedness, and improving access to computers and other emerging technologies; and (3) involving high school age youth in the mentoring of middle school students. Authorizes new Summer of Service programs under which students who will be entering grades 6 through 12 at the end of the summer and complete 100 hours of community-based service learning summer projects become eligible for an educational award of $500 from funds deposited in the National Service Trust. Permits the Corporation to increase the award to $750 for economically disadvantaged participants. Allows participants to earn a maximum of two summer of service educational awards. Authorizes new Youth Engagement Zone programs under which partnerships between community-based agencies and LEAs that serve a high number or percentage of disadvantaged students engage students and out-of-school youth in service-learning addressing specific community challenges. Authorizes new Semester of Service programs that allow secondary school students, including a large number or percentage of disadvantaged students, to earn academic credit for a semester of coordinated school-based or community-based service-learning that totals at least 70 hours and addresses specific community challenges. Requires participants to spend at least a third of such time participating in field-based activities. Gives funding priority to programs that: (1) involve students and community stakeholders in their design and implementation; (2) operate in low-income or rural communities; and (3) utilize adult volunteers, including retired or retiring adults. Directs the Corporation to contract for a 10-year longitudinal study into the effect Learn and Serve programs have on participants' academic performance and commitment to public service. Requires the results of such study to be reported to Congress and made available to the public. Subtitle C: Amendments to Subtitle C (National Service Trust Program) - (Sec. 1301) Revises the National Service Trust (AmeriCorps) program to: (1) include territories as eligible grant recipients; (2) prohibit the provision of grants to federal agencies; and (3) require grant recipients (other than fixed amount grant recipients) to report any non-Corporation federal funding for their program. Directs the Corporation to develop and, subject to the availability of appropriations, implement a plan to establish the number of approved national service positions as 88,000 for FY2010, and increase them to 115,000 for FY2011, 140,000 for FY2012, 170,000 for FY2013, 200,000 for FY2014, 210,000 for FY2015, 235,000 for FY2016, and 250,000 for FY2017. Requires such increases to be achieved through an appropriate balance of full- and part-time service positions. (Sec. 1302) Requires Americorps grant recipients and federal agencies operating or supporting national service programs to devote a portion of their funding to operating or supporting: (1) an Education Corps to address unmet educational needs; (2) a Healthy Futures Corps to address unmet health needs; (3) a Clean Energy Service Corps to address unmet environmental needs; (4) a Veterans Corps to address the unmet needs of veterans and members of the Armed Forces who are on active duty; or (5) an Opportunity Corps to address the unmet needs of economically disadvantaged individuals. Sets forth authorized Americorps programs that include those that: (1) meet the development needs of rural communities; (2) engage citizens in public safety, health, and emergency preparedness services; (3) expand the number of mentors for disadvantaged and other youths; (4) provide life skills training, employment training, educational assistance, counseling, or a mentoring relationship with an adult volunteer to individuals who are mostly disadvantaged youth; and (5) reduce recidivism by re-engaging court-involved youth and adults. Authorizes AmeriCorps grantees to implement program models that include: (1) community corps programs that promote community unity through the use of organized teams that include participants with diverse backgrounds and abilities; (2) service programs that recruit individuals with special skills or provide participants with specialized preservice training; (3) campus based programs involving postsecondary school students; (4) professional corps programs that recruit professionals for service positions that include salaries that are covered by public or private employers and may exceed the maximum living allowance; (5) programs that give veterans opportunities to participate in service projects; and (6) programs carried out by intermediaries that build the capacity of local nonprofit and faith-based organizations to expand and enhance services. Requires AmeriCorps programs to meet or exceed specified performance indicators. Requires national service programs that provide tutoring to elementary and secondary school students to: (1) certify that tutors have obtained their high school diploma and successfully completed pre- and in-service tutor training; and (2) offer high quality curricula that meet state academic content standards. Requires national service programs that promote citizenship and civic engagement to meet guidelines, to be established by the Corporation, that are consistent with the principles on which the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' citizenship programs are based. (Sec. 1303) Allows the Corporation to approve programs carried out by territories as national service programs that include education awards.
