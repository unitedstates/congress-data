Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, as additional requirements under such program, to: (1) modify the program in such a way that program graduates can be employed as soon as possible upon graduation and to actively assist and monitor graduates to ensure certifications are obtained in a minimal period following graduation; (2) require program participants to perform clinical tours; and (3) assign to each program participant a mentor who is employed at the same facility where the participant performs post-graduation obligated service. Increases maximum payments under the VA education debt reduction program. Allows the Secretary to waive such limits. Authorizes the Secretary to provide an educational loan repayment program for clinical researchers from disadvantaged backgrounds, in order to secure clinical research for the Veterans Health Administration. Directs the Secretary to: (1) transfer specified funds to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) for including VA facilities on a list of facilities eligible for assignment of participants in the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program; and (2) identify all VA medical centers and community-based outpatient clinics that may be eligible for such assignments."
