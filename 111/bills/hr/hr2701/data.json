    "text": "Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 - Title I: Budget and Personnel Authorizations - (Sec. 101) Permits, for purposes of provisions of the National Security Act of 1947 concerning the funding of intelligence activities, appropriated funds available to an intelligence agency to be obligated or expended for an intelligence or intelligence-related activity as appropriated for FY2010, as modified by such reprogramming and transfers of funds authorized by and reported to the appropriate congressional committees. (Sec. 102) Prohibits the authorization of appropriations by this Act from being deemed to constitute authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of the United States. (Sec. 103) Requires the budgetary effects of this Act to be determined by reference to the latest statement titled \"Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation\" for this Act, as long as such statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage of this Act. Title II: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System - (Sec. 201) Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act to make a technical modification concerning mandatory retirement for age. Title III: General Intelligence Community Matters - Subtitle A: Personnel Matters - (Sec. 301) Permits appropriations authorized by this Act for salary, pay, retirement, and other benefits for federal employees to be increased by such additional or supplemental amounts as may be necessary for increases in such compensation or benefits authorized by law. (Sec. 302) Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to allow a federal officer or employee or member of the Armed Forces to be detailed to the staff of an element of the intelligence community (IC) funded through the National Intelligence Program from another element of the IC or the federal government on a reimbursable or nonreimbursable basis, as jointly agreed upon by the heads of the receiving and detailing element, for a period of up to two years. (Sec. 303) Authorizes the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to fix rates of pay for critical positions in the IC in excess of the applicable limit, up to the rate payable for level II of the Executive Schedule. Requires the head of any IC department or agency to which the DNI grants such increased compensation authority to notify the intelligence committees and the DNI within 30 days after the exercise of such authority. (Sec. 304) Authorizes the President to award ranks to members of the Senior National Intelligence Service and other IC senior civilian officers not already covered by a rank award program. (Sec. 305) Requires the DNI to annually prepare and submit to the intelligence committees a personnel level assessment for each of the IC elements. (Sec. 306) Authorizes an additional 100 full-time equivalent positions for the Office of the DNI for each fiscal year to be used to fill positions made absent by employee participation in critical language training or the provision of language-capable services on a temporary basis. Requires the DNI to report annually to the intelligence committees on the use of authority provided in this section. (Sec. 307) Directs the DNI to: (1) issue regulations prohibiting any IC officer or employee from engaging in outside employment if such employment creates a conflict of interest or appearance thereof; and (2) report annually to the intelligence committees on any outside employment of IC officers and employees that was authorized by the head of an IC element. Subtitle B: Education Programs - (Sec. 311) Makes permanent the Pat Roberts Intelligence Scholars program (originally a pilot program under the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004). Allows scholarship funds to be used for tuition, books, travel expenses, and a stipend. (Sec. 312) Amends the National Security Agency Act of 1959 to extend the Louis Stokes Educational Scholarship Program to: (1) graduate students, in addition to undergraduates; and (2) individuals not employed by the federal government. Replaces the term \"employee\" with \"program participant.\" Repeals the requirement that the National Security Agency (NSA) publicly identify to participating educational institutions scholarship students who are NSA employees or training program participants. Authorizes IC elements other than the NSA to establish undergraduate or graduate training programs for prospective or current employees similar to the NSA programs. (Sec. 313) Authorizes the DNI to carry out programs to enhance the recruitment and retention of an ethnically and culturally diverse IC workforce with capabilities critical to U.S. national security interests. Authorizes the use of grants under the programs to institutions of higher education for the establishment or continued development of programs of study aimed at meeting current or emerging IC needs. Requires regular reports from institutions receiving such grants. Repeals similar programs under certain prior Acts. (Sec. 314) Authorizes the DNI to establish a pilot program for intensive language instruction in African languages. Terminates the pilot program after five years. Authorizes appropriations. Subtitle C: Acquisition Matters - (Sec. 321) Requires the DNI to conduct and submit to the intelligence committees an initial vulnerability assessment for any major system and its significant items of supply prior to completion of Milestone B or an equivalent acquisition decision, or prior to one year after the enactment of this Act for an acquisition decision completed prior to the date of enactment. Allows a 180-day extension of the submission of such assessment, if justified by the DNI to such committees. Requires subsequent assessments periodically through the life span of the system when warranted by a change of circumstances or upon request of an intelligence committee. Requires the DNI to: (1) give due consideration to such assessments when developing and determining the annual National Intelligence Program (NIP) budget; and (2) provide the intelligence committees a copy of each assessment, along with a proposed schedule for subsequent assessments. Provides limits on the obligation of funding for major systems for which such assessments are required, if such assessments are not timely submitted. (Sec. 322) Prohibits any funds appropriated to an IC element from being obligated for an IC business system transformation having a total cost in excess of $3 million unless: (1) the transformation is certified as complying with intelligence enterprise architecture and other DNI policy or standards, or is necessary to achieve a critical national security objective or to prevent a significant adverse effect on an essential project; and (2) the certification is approved by a board within the IC business system transformation governance structure. Requires: (1) the DNI to develop and implement an enterprise architecture to cover all IC business systems, and the functions and activities supported by such systems; (2) the DNI to establish and implement, within 60 days after the enactment of this Act, an investment review process for IC business systems; (3) the DNI to include in annual budget materials specified information concerning each IC business system for which budget funding is proposed; (4) the DNI to establish the board to take certain actions to implement this section; and (5) the DNI to report during 2011 through 2015 to the intelligence committees concerning compliance with requirements of this section. (Sec. 323) Directs the program manager for each IC system to submit quarterly to the DNI a major system cost report including, for each system, its total acquisition cost, cost or schedule variances, and changes from milestones or performance measures. Requires additional reports from such program manager in the case of cost increases equal to or greater than the significant or critical cost growth threshold for such system, requiring the DNI to notify Congress of such cost growth. Prohibits the obligation of funding for such system upon the DNI's failure to submit such notification. Provides for the treatment of cost increases occurring prior to the enactment of this Act. (Sec. 324) Requires the DNI, upon a determination of a major system cost increase greater than or equal to the critical cost growth threshold for that system, to: (1) determine the root cause or causes of such cost growth; and (2) carry out an assessment of projected costs of completing the system, the costs of an alternative system, and the need to reduce funding for other systems due to such cost growth. Requires the termination of such system unless the DNI submits to Congress a major system report certifying the necessity of such additional costs. Requires specified DNI actions if a major system is not terminated (including a restructure that addresses the root causes of the cost growth), or if a major system is terminated (including alternative plans to meet intelligence requirements not met by such system). Allows the DNI to waive certain requirements with respect to a terminated system upon determining that at least 90% of the amount of the current baseline estimate for the system has been expended and notifying the intelligence committees of such determination. (Sec. 325) Requires the DNI to provide to the intelligence committees a five-year Future Year Intelligence Plan for each expenditure center and each major system in the NIP. Requires the DNI to provide to such committees a Long-term Budget Projection for each element of the NIP acquiring a major system that includes the budget for the five-year period following the last budget year for which proposed funding is included in a Plan. Requires each Plan and Projection to be submitted to Congress along with the annual intelligence budget, along with a major system affordability report concerning the acquisition of a major system funded under the NIP. (Sec. 326) Allows the DNI to authorize the head of an IC element to exercise any acquisition authority authorized for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) under the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 for an acquisition that is more than 50% funded by the NIP. Provides acquisition authority limits similar to those provided in such Act. Subtitle D: Congressional Oversight, Plans, and Reports - (Sec. 331) Requires all reports from the President, DNI, or head of an IC element to the intelligence committees on intelligence activities and covert actions to be written and to include the legal basis under which the activity or action is being or was conducted. Requires a covert action finding by the President to be reported in writing, along with the reasons for any limited access to a finding or notice of significant change in a finding. Directs the President, within 180 days after submitting a limited access statement, to ensure that: (1) all members of the intelligence committees are provided access to the finding or notification; or (2) a statement of the reasons that it is essential to continue to limit such access to meet extraordinary circumstances affecting vital U.S. interests is submitted to specified congressional leaders. Requires the President, if the statement under (2) is chosen, to notify all members of the intelligence committees of that choice, and to provide such members a general description regarding the finding or notification. Outlines specific factors to be taken into consideration by the President when determining whether an activity constitutes a significant undertaking, for purposes of required congressional notification concerning activities other than covert actions. Directs the President to maintain a record of each Member of Congress to whom a finding is reported or a notice is provided. (Sec. 332) Requires the head of each IC element to annually submit to the intelligence committees either: (1) a certification of compliance with all congressional notification requirements and that any information required to be submitted has been properly submitted; or (2) a statement of the reasons the head of the element is unable to submit such certification, a description of any information not properly submitted, and an assurance that such information will be submitted as soon as possible. (Sec. 333) Directs the DNI to report to the intelligence committees on all IC detention and interrogation policies and procedures. Requires appropriate parts of such report to be submitted to the defense and judiciary committees when the report addresses an IC element within DOD or the Department of Justice (DOJ).

(Sec. 336) Requires the President to notify Congress of each existing US cybersecurity program, and to provide such notification within 30 days after commencement of operations of a new cybersecurity program. Outlines information required under such notification, including the legal basis for the program and an assessment of its privacy impact with respect to civil liberties. Directs the head of a federal department or agency with responsibility for a cybersecurity program for which a notification was submitted to: (1) report to Congress and the President on the results of any audit or review of such program and the legality of such program's implementation; and (2) update such report annually, along with any appropriate information concerning a newly-implemented program. Requires reports to Congress and the President from the heads of any federal department or agency with responsibility for a cybersecurity program for which a notification was submitted. Directs the Inspectors General of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and of the IC to report jointly to Congress and the President on the status of the sharing of cyber threat information. Requires the DNI to submit to Congress: (1) a plan for recruiting, retaining, and training a highly-qualified cybersecurity IC workforce to secure its networks; and (2) a report on guidelines and recommended legislation to improve US cybersecurity (with annual report updates). Terminates the authorities of this section on December 31, 2013.
