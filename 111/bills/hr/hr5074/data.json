Establishes in the Department of Commerce an Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology and requires the Under Secretary to conduct policy analysis on innovation and technical standards to improve and promote U.S. competitiveness. Requires the Director to reorganize the scientific and technical research and services laboratory program as specified. Directs the Secretary to promote collaboration among federal departments and agencies and private sector stakeholders. Requires the Director to establish, within the Hollings Manufacturing Partnership Program, an innovative services initiative to assist small- and medium-sized manufacturers in: (1) reducing their energy usage and environmental waste; and (2) accelerating the domestic commercialization of new product technologies, including components for renewable energy systems. Directs the Secretary to establish appropriate criteria to be considered in determining the cost share of a Hollings Manufacturing Extension Center, but in no case shall it exceed half of the costs incurred by such Center. Revises the funding for a Center under the Program after the sixth year of operation. Requires the Director to establish a bioscience research program. Authorizes the Director to establish university research centers at institutions of higher education to conduct research to further the program's objectives."
