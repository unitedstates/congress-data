Directs the Secretary to establish the Commercial Real Estate Credit Guarantee Program, under which the Secretary shall guarantee payments of interest and principal on an approved credit instrument. Requires 50% of the Program to be used for small- and mid-sized institutions. Permits loans for either owner-occupied or nonowner-occupied commercial real estate. States that guarantees issued under this Act constitute general obligations of the United States, for which the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged. Expresses the intent of Congress that the Program be utilized when such utilization proves beneficial, and not be unduly inhibited by concerns related to potential unfavorable regulatory accounting treatment."
