Amends the Internal Revenue Code to grant: (1) individual taxpayers a $5,000 tax credit through June 30, 2010, for refinancing a mortgage on a principal residence located in the United States; (2) mortgage lenders an exclusion from gross income for their share of appreciation from a principal residence subject to a mortgage modification; (3) an exclusion from gross income for income resulting from a discharge of indebtedness under a mortgage modification; (4) a tax credit for up to $15,000 of the purchase price of a principal residence purchased before July 1, 2010, on which the taxpayer makes not less than a 5% downpayment; and (5) an exclusion from gross income of gain on the sale of single-family residential rental property held by a taxpayer for two years or more and rented as a single dwelling unit on a regular basis. Grants civil immunity and legal protections to mortgage servicers who enter into loan modifications, mortgage workouts, or other loss mitigation plans."
