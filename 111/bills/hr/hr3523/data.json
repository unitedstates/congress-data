Requires the Secretary to award competitive grants to IHEs to establish Centers of Excellence for Biofuels Research and Training that: (1) integrate biofuels research, training, and instruction; (2) coordinate the broad range of disciplines relevant to biofuels engineering; and (3) work with companies that are commercializing biofuels technology, and local communities spurring economic development and job creation in the biofuels sector. Directs the Secretary to award portable graduate fellowships to students pursuing doctorates in biofuels engineering. Requires the fellowships, which are for up to three years of study, to provide recipients with an annual living stipend, and cover graduate tuition and incidental expenses. Requires federal agencies, including national laboratories, to make research facilities available to accredited biofuel engineering programs."
