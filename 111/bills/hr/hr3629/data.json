Requires the plan to include measures to address and mitigate the full range of such impacts, including: (1) preserving, maintaining, and restoring wildlife migration corridors, key habitats, and the ecologically functional connectivity among key habitats sufficient to ensure that species remain viable and are able to adapt to the impacts of climate change; (2) addressing control of invasive species; (3) maintaining hydrological functionality; and (5) protection of cultural and historical resources. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out the plan on any federal, state, private, or tribal lands, provided that activities are carried out in full consultation with, and with the concurrence of, the owner or entity with principal responsibility for the management of such lands. Authorizes the Secretary to transfer funds of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to other federal agencies for: (1) expenditure under programs of such agencies that are designed to fund conservation-related activities on nonfederal lands; and (2) mitigation activities on federal lands managed by such agencies."
