Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to include within the mission of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office to: (1) lead the development and implementation of the national strategic five-year plan for improving U.S. nuclear forensic and attribution capabilities required under the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010; (2) establish within the Office a National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center to provide centralized stewardship, planning, assessment, gap analysis, exercises, improvement, and integration for all federal nuclear forensics and attribution activities; (3) establish a National Nuclear Forensics Expertise Development Program that is devoted to developing and maintaining a vibrant and enduring academic pathway from undergraduate to post-doctorate study in nuclear and geochemical science specialties directly relevant to technical nuclear forensics and that shall provide undergraduate and doctoral student scholarships and awards to ensure that faculty and their graduate students have a sustained funding stream; and (4) report to Congress annually on such activities. Requires the Director of the Office and each of the relevant departments that are partners in the Center to: (1) include, as part of required assessments, evaluations, and reviews, each office's or department's activities and investments in support of nuclear forensics and attribution activities and specific goals and objectives accomplished during the previous year pursuant to the national strategic five-year plan for improving U.S. nuclear forensic and attribution capabilities; (2) attach, as an appendix to the Joint Interagency Annual Review, the most current version of such strategy and plan; and (3) include a description of new or amended bilateral and multilateral agreements and efforts in support of nuclear forensics and attribution activities accomplished during the previous year."
