    "text": "Defined Contribution Plan Fee Transparency Act of 2009 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a penalty tax on employers maintaining defined contribution pension plans for the failure of their plan administrators to provide plan participants or beneficiaries, prior to enrollment in a plan, with certain notices and disclosures pertaining to fees and charges, investment alternatives, and the manner for making elections among designated investment alternatives. Sets forth the types of information about investment alternatives required in a plan notice or disclosure. Requires plan administrators to provide plan participants and beneficiaries, after enrollment, with quarterly notices describing the investment alternatives and associated fees and charges in their plans. Imposes a penalty tax on a provider of services to a defined contribution plan for failure to provide a plan administrator with certain disclosures, including the total fees and expenses expected to be paid by a plan and any relationships of such service provider with third parties offering investment products. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to issue final regulations on the written formats allowed for providing the notices and disclosures required by this Act."
