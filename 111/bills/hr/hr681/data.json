Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to extend for 116 days the terms of the licenses for recovered spectrum. Requires, on request, the reissue of any household digital-to-analog converter box coupons that expired without being redeemed. Requires expediting the delivery of household digital-to-analog converter box coupons by sending them via presorted first class mail. Allows a station to terminate analog broadcasting (and to continue broadcasting exclusively in digital signals) before the date established by law for termination of all full power analog station licenses. Requires the FCC to permit public safety entities to use spectrum thus relinquished if the FCC determines that such use does not cause harmful interference to full-power television stations in the analog or digital service. Extends until September 30, 2012 (currently, September 30, 2011) the FCC's spectrum auction authority."
