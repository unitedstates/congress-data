Extends through 2011 the exemption from alternative minimum tax (AMT) treatment of interest on certain tax-exempt bonds. Extends through 2011 the period for issuing recovery zone economic development bonds and recovery zone facility bonds. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to allocate 2010 national limitations on recovery bonds based upon state unemployment statistics. Allows a full offset against the AMT for new market tax credit amounts. Extends through 2011: (1) the tax exemption allowed for interest on bonds guaranteed by a federal home loan bank; and (2) small issuer rules for the allocation of tax-exempt interest expense by financial institutions."
