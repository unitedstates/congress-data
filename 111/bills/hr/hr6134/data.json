Requires the President by regulation to subject employees in the executive branch, during FY2011, to: (1) a total of two weeks of mandatory unpaid leave; or (2) the pro rata equivalent in the case of employees serving for less than the entire fiscal year. Requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, by regulation, to apply such requirements to employees in the judicial branch. Allows such regulations to make exceptions for: (1) national security reasons; (2) reasons relating to the public health or safety, including effective law enforcement; or (3) such other reasons as the President considers necessary or appropriate. Limits the aggregate amount which may be appropriated or otherwise made available for any fiscal year for allowances and expenses (including salaries) of any legislative branch office, except the U.S. Capitol Police, to 96% of the aggregate amount appropriated or otherwise made available for FY2010 for such allowances and expenses."
