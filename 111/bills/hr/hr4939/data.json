    "text": "Social Security and Medicare Protection Act - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to make it out of order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any concurrent resolution on the budget (or related measure) that would set forth a surplus for any fiscal year less than the surplus of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for that fiscal year. Creates an exception to such point of order if a violation of it would result from an assumption in the measure of an increase in outlays or a decrease in revenue relative to the baseline underlying the measure for Social Security or Medicare reform legislation for any such year. Makes it out of order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any (spending or tax) measure if its enactment would cause the surplus for any fiscal year covered by the most recently agreed to budget resolution to be less than the surplus of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for that fiscal year. Creates an exception to such point of order similar to the other one. Declares that, if the President's budget recommends an on-budget surplus for any fiscal year less than the surplus of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for that fiscal year, then it shall include a detailed proposal for Social Security or Medicare reform legislation."
