Prohibits a creditor from extending a covered loan with respect to which the creditor uses as security either: (1) access to a borrower's financial account; or (2) the title of a vehicle. Amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to prohibit a remotely created check that: (1) is not created by the financial institution that holds the customer account from which the check is to be paid; and (2) does not bear a signature applied by the person from whose account the check is to be paid. Declares unenforceable, with respect to any consumer, any contract made in violation of this Act."
