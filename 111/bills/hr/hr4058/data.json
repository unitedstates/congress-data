Requires the Secretary, for each of FY2011-FY2015, to designate for the pilot program at least 20 military construction projects, taking into account specified considerations. Requires each contractor or subcontractor on a designated project to assure that it participates in a qualified apprenticeship or other training program for each craft or trade classification of worker that it intends to employ on the construction project."
