Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to ensure that a loan used for such purchase in a corporation that has been reviewed and approved by a lender approved by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, a/k/a Fannie Mae) is not denied solely because such corporation: (1) is not preapproved by FNMA; or (2) is an affordable limited equity cooperative."
