Requires an operator to provide the surface owner with appropriate financial assurance of reclamation in lieu of executing a surface use agreement. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to provide notice of upcoming lease sales and drilling permits to each: (1) surface owner of affected covered land; and (2) permittee or right-of-way holder with the right to use the surface of affected federal land."
