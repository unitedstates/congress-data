    "text": "Discretionary Spending Control Act of 2009 - Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to extend through FY2014 the spending limits (spending caps) for the discretionary categories in new budget authority and outlays. Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to make it out of order in either chamber to consider: (1) legislation that increases the discretionary spending limits for any ensuing fiscal year after the budget year or would cause the discretionary spending limits for such year to be breached; (2) a budget resolution that would cause the discretionary spending limits for the budget year to be breached; or (3) any appropriation bill or joint resolution, amendment, or conference report that provides advance discretionary new budget authority that first becomes available for any fiscal year after the budget year at an amount for any program, project, or activity above the amount of appropriations for FY2007 for them. Amends the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act to require preview and final discretionary sequestration reports to set forth estimates for the current year and each subsequent year through FY2014 of the applicable discretionary spending limits for each category and an explanation of any adjustments in such limits. Amends the Act to extend Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) enforcement mechanisms through FY2014."
