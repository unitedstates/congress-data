Requires the Secretary, not later than two years after the enactment of this Act, to report on the findings and recommendations of the research project. Requires the Secretary to expand and intensify public health research on gestational diabetes, including; (1) developing and testing novel approaches for improving postpartum testing or screening and for preventing type 2 diabetes in women with a history of gestational diabetes; and (2) conducting research to\u00a0further understanding of the\u00a0factors and health systems that influence the risk\u00a0of gestational diabetes and the development of type 2 diabetes in women with a history of gestational diabetes. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director of the CDC, to: (1) award grants on a competitive basis for demonstration projects that implement evidence-based interventions to reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes, the recurrence of such disease in subsequent pregnancies, and the development of type 2 diabetes in women with a history of gestational diabetes; and (2) report to Congress, not later than four years after the enactment of this Act, on the results of the demonstration projects. Sets forth priorities for awarding grants and requirements for the use of grant funds for carrying out demonstration projects. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director of the CDC, to work with state and Indian tribal-based diabetes prevention and control programs assisted by the CDC to encourage postpartum follow-up after gestational diabetes to reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes and its recurrence, the development of type 2 diabetes in at-risk women, and\u00a0related complications.
