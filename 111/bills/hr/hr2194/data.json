    "date": "2010-07-01", 
    "text": "Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 - (Sec. 3) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) international diplomatic efforts to address Iran's illicit nuclear efforts and support for international terrorism are more likely to be effective if strong additional sanctions are imposed on the government of Iran; (2) U.S. concerns regarding Iran are strictly the result of that government\u0092s actions; (3) the September 2009 revelation that Iran is developing a secret uranium enrichment site near Qom highlights the urgency that Iran disclose the full nature of its nuclear program and provide the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) unfettered access to its facilities; (4) because of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) involvement in Iran's nuclear program, international terrorism, and domestic human rights abuses the President should impose the full range of sanctions on individuals or entities with IRGC ties; (5) the United States should adopt additional measures to prevent the diversion of sensitive dual-use technologies to Iran; (6) the President should take measures to respond to violations of human rights and religious freedom in Iran; (7) it is in the U.S. national interest to allow responsible U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations to establish and carry out operations in Iran to promote civil society and foster goodwill among the people of Iran; (8) the United States should not issue a license for the export of nuclear materials, services, or technology to a country that is providing similar materials, services, or technology to another country that is not in full compliance with its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) unless their provision does not undermine U.S. nonproliferation policies; and (9) the people of the United States have feelings of friendship for the people of Iran and regret that developments in recent decades have created impediments to that friendship. Title I: Sanctions - (Sec. 102) Amends the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 (ISA) to direct the President to impose three or more specified ISA sanctions if a person (defined by such Act to include a natural person, business enterprise, or government entity operating as a business enterprise) has knowingly made an investment of $20 million or more, or any combination of investments of at least $5 million which in the aggregate equals or exceeds $20 million in any 12-month period, that directly and significantly contributed to Iran's ability to develop petroleum resources. (Under current law the sanction thresholds are $40 million, $10 million, and $40 million, respectively.) Directs the President to impose three or more specified ISA sanctions on a person that knowingly sells, leases, or provides goods, services, technology, information, or provides support related to the production of refined petroleum products in Iran: (1) any of which has a fair market value of $1 million or more; or (2) that during a 12-month period have an aggregate fair market value of $5 million or more. Directs the President to impose three or more specified ISA sanctions on a person that knowingly: (1) provides Iran with refined petroleum products that have a fair market value of $1 million or more, or that, during a 12-month period, have an aggregate fair market value of $5 million or more; or (2) sells, leases, or provides to Iran certain goods, services, technology, information, or support any of which has a fair market value of $1 million or more, or that during a 12-month period have an aggregate fair market value of $5 million or more. Exempts from such sanctions underwriters and insurance providers exercising due diligence. Directs the President to impose three or more specified ISA sanctions for violation of provisions regarding nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons of mass destruction or advanced conventional weapons. Prohibits issuance of export licenses or approval of transfers pursuant to a civil nuclear cooperation agreement with the United States for any country whose nationals have engaged in activities with Iran relating to the acquisition or development of nuclear weapons or related technology or missiles or other advanced conventional weapons capable of delivering a nuclear weapon. Authorizes waiver of such prohibition: (1) upon presidential determination and congressional notification that a government does not know or have reason to know about such activity, or is taking steps to prevent its recurrence and to penalize the person involved; or (2) for national security reasons on a case-by-case basis with congressional notification. Revises parent entity and affiliate/subsidiary provisions to impose sanctions upon: (1) a parent entity that had actual knowledge or should have known that an affiliate or subsidiary engaged in sanctionable activities; or (2) an affiliate or subsidiary that knowingly engaged in sanctionable activities. Establishes additional mandatory foreign exchange, banking, and property sanctions for violations of petroleum product and weapons of mass destruction prohibitions. Requires: (1) each prospective contractor submitting a federal government bid to certify that the contractor or a person owned or controlled by the contractor does not conduct any sanctionable activity; and (2) contract termination or a three-year maximum suspension for federal contract eligibility for submission of a false certification. Authorizes the President to waive such certification on a case-by-case basis for reasons of U.S. national interest. Amends presidential waiver of sanctions provisions to: (1) revise the standard from \"important\" to U.S. national interest to \"necessary\" to U.S. national interest; and (2) require in a waiver request information regarding an activity's effect on petroleum resource development or nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons development. Requires the President to report to Congress annually regarding the dollar value amount of trade, including in the energy sector, between Iran and each country maintaining membership in the Group of Twenty (G-20) Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors. Expands the definition of \"person\" to include a financial institution, insurer, underwriter, guarantor, and any other business organization. (Excludes from such definition a government or government entity that is not operating as a business enterprise.) Redefines \"petroleum resources\" to include petroleum, refined petroleum products, oil or liquefied natural gas, natural gas resources, oil or liquefied natural gas tankers, and products used to construct or maintain pipelines used to transport oil or liquefied natural gas. Defines \"refined petroleum products\" to mean diesel, gasoline, jet fuel (including naphtha-type and kerosene-type jet fuel), and aviation gasoline.

Directs the President, upon such designation, to: (1) report to Congress; and (2) require an export license for the export of U.S. goods, services, or technologies that, if diverted to Iran, would contribute to Iran's weapons programs, defense capabilities, or support of terrorism (with a presumption of denial for all such license applications).

Title IV: General Provisions - (Sec. 401) Terminates the provisions of this Act 30 days after the date on which the President certifies to Congress that: (1) the government of Iran has ceased supporting acts of international terrorism and no longer satisfies certain requirements for designation as a state sponsor of terrorism; and (2) Iran has ceased the pursuit, acquisition, and development of nuclear, biological, chemical, and ballistic weapons. Authorizes the President to waive, if in the U.S. national interest: (1) the application of sanctions; (2) sanctions on Iranian officials complicit in human rights abuses; (3) the prohibition on procurement contracts with persons that export sensitive technology to Iran; or (4) the imposition of the licensing requirement for a country designated as a Destination of Diversion Concern. Directs the President to report to Congress regarding any such waiver.
