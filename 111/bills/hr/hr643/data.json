    "text": "Care for Life Act of 2009 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish an Office of Pregnancy Support Services to encourage and assist pregnant women to carry their children to live birth by providing services that will alleviate the financial, social, emotional, and other difficulties that may otherwise lead to an abortion. Requires the Secretary to: (1) develop the Pregnancy Care Information Service database; (2) conduct an annual nationwide best practices conference; and (3) provide for the establishment and operation of a toll-free number to provide referrals to pregnancy support services. Authorizes the Secretary to award competitive grants to entities to provide such services. Requires the Secretary to develop and implement a public outreach campaign to provide information on such services to: (1) vulnerable women; and (2) facilities receiving funds for family planning services. Authorizes the Secretary to awards grants to institutions of higher education for the exclusive purpose of providing pregnancy support services. Prohibits health insurance issuers offering coverage in the individual market from imposing any preexisting condition exclusion or any waiting period or otherwise discriminating in coverage or premiums related to pregnancy against a woman who has had at least 12 months of creditable coverage before seeking coverage. Makes this provision retroactive to January 1, 2009. Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to make grants or enter into contracts for the establishment and operation of pregnant and parenting student services offices or agencies. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to revise provisions regarding the adoption tax credit, including to: (1) increase the credit for the adoption of a special needs child; and (2) make the credit refundable."
