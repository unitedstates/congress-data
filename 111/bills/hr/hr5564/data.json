Directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to: (1) deny a judgment evading foreign state access to U.S. capital markets unless the proceeds of borrowing or securities issuance are to be used in the first instance to satisfy in full all final judgments that form the basis for such designation as such a state; and (2) require all periodic filings made by such a state with the SEC to prominently bear a warning describing its failure to satisfy outstanding judgments. Imposes similar restrictions on state-owned corporations of such states. Requires: (1) a proposal to extend bilateral or multilateral assistance to a judgment evading state to bear notice that such state is a judgment evading state; and (2) the Secretary of the Treasury to report annually to Congress identifying each such state."
