    "text": "Rural Flood Mitigation and Recovery Act of 2010 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to determine that a flood damage reduction project for a flood prone disaster area is justified and to recommend the project solely on the basis that the non-federal interest has demonstrated that the project is appropriate and needed to protect the area's long-term economic viability. Amends the\u00a0Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to direct the President: (1) upon declaring that a major disaster exists in an area due to flooding, to determine whether the area qualifies as a flood prone disaster area; (2) to determine an area to be a flood prone disaster area if it has experienced at least two other major disasters due to flooding during the preceding five-year period; (3) in making contributions for hazard mitigation measures to benefit such an area, and for repair, restoration, and replacement of facilities for such area's benefit, to provide for a federal share of 90% (or 100% if the President determines that the measures would not be carried out without additional federal funding and are necessary to protect the area's long-term economic viability); and (4) in each state that includes such an area, to establish a task force to ensure that activities in response to the major disaster in that area are coordinated and carried out appropriately. Requires the President: (1) in making contributions for hazard mitigation measures for a major disaster, to review an application for assistance within three months of receipt and begin providing contributions to the cost of the measures within six months after the disaster is declared; and (2) in determining whether to provide financial assistance or direct services to an individual or household affected by a major disaster, to consider the economic impact on the area and the number of other major disasters that have been declared there during the preceding five-year period. Permits a higher federal share payable for repair or reconstruction for Interstate highway system projects to be accomplished more than 180 days after the actual occurrence of a natural disaster or catastrophic failure if the Secretary determines that inclement weather or flooding prevented accomplishment within that period. Requires the President to select three declared major disasters for the use of modified response procedures, under which the President shall make contributions to a state or local government for a repair, restoration, reconstruction, or replacement project: (1) at the time a bid is selected for awarding the contract for the project; and (2) in an amount based on the bid selected. Directs the President to: (1) establish an Indian tribe disaster response management pilot program; and (2) report to Congress on efforts of the President to utilize for hazard mitigation projects contributions made for the repair, restoration, reconstruction, or replacement of facilities damaged or destroyed by a major disaster. Authorizes the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to make a grant to assist a state in conducting a study to determine and prioritize road projects that need to be completed for the state to be prepared for flooding or other potential disasters and to develop an implementation plan for priority projects. Directs the Administrator to report to Congress on efforts to improve communication with state and local officials with respect to FEMA's disaster response, recovery, and hazard mitigation programs. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on: (1) the effectiveness of the major disaster declaration process and other response under the Stafford Act in providing assistance to distressed communities; and (2) the application processes and paperwork required for programs under the Stafford Act that provide assistance for hazard mitigation activities."
