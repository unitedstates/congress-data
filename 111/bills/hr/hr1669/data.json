Directs the Secretary to establish a program to: (1) purchase municipal securities; (2) issue securities backed by pools of municipal securities; and (3) provide credit enhancement or guarantees for municipal securities. Authorizes the Federal Financing Bank to: (1) make commitments to purchase and sell any municipal security issued under a specified plan approved by the Secretary; (2) guarantee repayment of principal and interest on any municipal security issued under a plan approved by the Secretary; and (3) issue and sell instruments representing interests in a pool of municipal securities purchased by the Bank. Prohibits the purchase or guarantee of a municipal security under this Act unless the Secretary has approved, prior to its issuance, the method, source, and timing of financing, as well as all terms and conditions. States that municipal securities sold by the Secretary or the Bank under this Act, and instruments issued by the Secretary or the Bank that represent pools of municipal securities, may be insured as to the payment of principal or interest by the Secretary or the Bank, respectively. Authorizes the Board to establish a credit facility to provide financial resources for the purchase of municipal securities by federal reserve banks or member banks or other persons."
