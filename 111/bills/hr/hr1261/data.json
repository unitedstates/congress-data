Requires premarket approval of all new tobacco products. Sets forth standards for the sale of modified risk tobacco products. Directs the Administrator to establish the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee. Revises tobacco product warning labels and advertising requirements. Requires the Administrator to establish standards requiring tobacco product manufacturers to publicly disclose a list of ingredients in each brand style.
