    "text": "Enforcing Orders and Reducing Customs Evasion Act of 2010 - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require the Commissioner responsible for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to initiate, upon petition or a referral from another federal agency, an investigation into claims of evasion of antidumping or countervailing duties (including any cash deposits or other security) with respect to covered merchandise imported into the United States. Requires the Commissioner, in the case of an affirmative preliminary determination, to: (1) suspend liquidation of each entry of the covered merchandise, and reopen and hold in suspension any liquidated entry; (2) notify the administering authority (Secretary of Commerce, or other responsible U.S. officer) of the determination and request identification of the applicable cash deposit rate to apply to the entries at issue; and (3) require the posting of such deposit for each entry. Requires the Commissioner, in the case of an affirmative final determination, to: (1) suspend or continue to suspend liquidation of each entry of covered merchandise; (2) notify the administering authority of the determination and request identification of the applicable antidumping or countervailing duties or cash deposit rate for such entries; (3) require the posting of cash deposits and assess duties; (4) review and reassess the amount of bond or other security posted for covered merchandise entered on or after the date of such determination; and (5) take appropriate additional enforcement measures. Requires the administering authority to apply the highest applicable cash deposit or antidumping or countervailing duty in cases where the producer or exporter of covered merchandise is unknown. Requires the Commissioner, to the maximum extent practicable, to ensure that CBP employs and assigns sufficient personnel to prevent the importation of merchandise in a manner that evades antidumping and countervailing duty orders or findings. Requires the Commissioner to hire at least an additional 100 full-time equivalent personnel to serve as Commercial Enforcement Officers within the Office of Field Operations. Applies the amendments made by this Act to goods from Canada and Mexico."
