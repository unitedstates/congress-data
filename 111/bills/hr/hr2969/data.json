Sets forth grant application requirements. Requires the Administrator to conduct a competitive process to select and fund applications, giving priority to applications that: (1) are submitted by water systems that are at the greatest and most immediate risk of facing significant climate-related negative impacts; (2) will impact the largest numbers of water users; and (3) will provide the greatest benefit per dollar expended. Limits the federal share to 50% of the cost."
