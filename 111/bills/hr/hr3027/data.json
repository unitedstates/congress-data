Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to authorize: (1) the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to make grants on a competitive basis to states and other jurisdictions to assist predisaster hazard mitigation strategies; and (2) the use of technical and financial assistance under such Act to support state programs that provide grants to low income homeowners for wind and flood inspections of their principal residences and for implementation of hazard mitigation improvements.. Limits the use of grants to assist predisaster hazard mitigation improvements to: (1) residential property valued up to $250,000; (2) small business property valued up to $500,000; and (3) residential rental property valued up to the product of the number of rental units in such property and $250,000. Prohibits grants from being used for projects located in the Coastal Barrier Resources System. Directs the Administrator to arrange with the National Academy of Sciences or a similar organization to examine methods to coordinate the functions of man-made and natural storm buffers."
