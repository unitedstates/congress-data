    "text": "Linked Learning Pathways Affording College and Career Success Act - Directs the Secretary of Education to award renewable, competitive, matching grants to local educational agencies that partner with a qualified intermediary and at least one educational stakeholder to establish or expand linked learning pathways and a system of pathways that gives secondary school students pathway options. Defines \"linked learning pathways\" as comprehensive, multi-year high school programs of study that integrate: (1) rigorous academics that are aligned with entrance requirements for the state's public institutions of higher education; (2) career and technical education geared toward jobs in high pay, high growth, or high skill industries; (3) work-based learning; and (4) supplemental services. Favors grant applications that propose to accomplish at least three of the following: (1) serve students attending underperforming schools with graduation rates below 60% and high concentrations of impoverished students; (2) offer multiple linked learning pathways; (3) encourage students to seek careers in fields where their gender, race, or ethnicity is underrepresented; (4) increase the secondary school completion and post-secondary enrollment rates of traditionally underrepresented students; (5) reduce the academic achievement gap; or (6) utilize research-based practices to implement linked learning pathways. Directs the Secretary to provide for an independent evaluation of this program's grants and disseminate the best practices that emerge to support linked learning pathways."
