Requires states and correctional facilities to work with family members and aftercare providers in developing educational services and transition plans for youth following their stay in state and local institutions for neglected or delinquent youth. Requires states to use part of their grant under part A (Teacher and Principal Training and Recruiting Fund) of title II of the ESEA to train teachers and principals to effectively engage families in their children's education. Establishes a new part E (Family Engagement in Education Programs) under title V of the ESEA requiring the Secretary of Education to provide funding to each state to establish a State Family Engagement Coordinating Council to assure coordination and integration of family engagement activities across the education spectrum. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to: (1) statewide nonprofit organizations to establish Statewide Family Engagement Centers to provide comprehensive training, technical assistance, and capacity building to states, LEAs, schools, and organizations that support family-school partnerships to assist parents in participating effectively in their children's education; and (2) local nonprofit parent organizations to create Local Family Engagement Centers which are to be assessed on their ability to assist parents in overcoming barriers to engaging in their children's education. Directs the Secretary to issue rules that specify research-based metrics on family engagement in education for entities receiving this Act's funding. Requires that there be established in the Department of Education dedicated staff, including a Director, for family and community engagement within the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education."
