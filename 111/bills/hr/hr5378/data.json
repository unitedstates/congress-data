Authorizes the Secretary to waive such prohibition for reasons of national interest. Describes such offense as any offense under UAE law: (1) that was committed in connection with the assault on Mohammed Shah Poor; and (2) for which Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al-Nahyan has not been tried. Directs the Secretary to revoke the nonimmigrant visa or other documentation of any alien who is rendered ineligible for such visa or documentation under the terms of this Act."
