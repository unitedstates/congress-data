Requires that the constitution and bylaws of the Nation be the constitution and bylaws of the Nation's Tribal Council dated January 21, 2001 (including amendments). Instructs the Secretary of the Interior, upon receipt of a written request of the Tribal Council, to hold a referendum for members to adopt a new constitution and bylaws. Specifies the role and duties of the Tribal Council. Requires that the membership roll of the Nation be determined in accordance with the membership criteria established by the ordinance of the Nation numbered 04-01-100 and dated February 7, 2004.
