    "text": "Streamlining America's Various Energy Needs Act - Directs federal agencies to expedite their review of permits and take other actions as necessary to accelerate completion of projects that will increase energy production, transmission, or conservation, while maintaining safety, public health, and environmental protections. Establishes an interagency task force to monitor and assist federal agencies to: (1) comply with this Act; and (2) set up mechanisms to coordinate federal, state, tribal, and local permitting in geographic areas where increased permitting activity is expected. States that nothing in this Act affects judicial review of an agency action."
