Amends the Clean Air Act with respect to emissions from small oil and gas exploration and production-related equipment. Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to: (1) amend the definition of \"wastewater treatment facility\" to include produced water from an oil production facility; and (2) require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish cost-effective minimal requirements for the prevention of oil and hazardous substance discharges for small facilities with oil storage capacities of less than 50,000 gallons at which no single tank exceeds a nominal capacity of 21,000 gallons."
