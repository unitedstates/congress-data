Authorizes states to extend the repayment period for a fund loan from the current limit of 20 years to the lesser of 30 years or the design life of the project to be financed with the proceeds. Conditions eligibility for a loan on the recipient developing and implementing a fiscal sustainability plan for any portion of the treatment works proposed for repair, replacement, or expansion. Sets forth plan elements. Revises the types of assistance that may be provided under state water pollution control revolving loan funds. Authorizes fund grants to owners and operators of treatment works: (1) that serve a population of 10,000 or fewer for technical, planning, and financial management assistance, user fee analysis, budgeting, capital improvement planning, facility operation and maintenance, equipment replacement, repair schedules, and other activities to improve wastewater treatment plant management and operations; and (2) for assessing the energy and water consumption of the treatment works and evaluating potential opportunities for energy and water conservation through facility operation and maintenance, equipment replacement, and projects or activities that promote the efficient use of energy and water. Authorizes states to provide additional subsidization, including forgiveness of principal and negative interest loans, to benefit specified municipalities or to implement a process, material, technique, or technology to address water-efficiency goals, address energy-efficiency goals, mitigate stormwater runoff, or encourage environmentally sensitive project planning, design, and construction. Requires states to: (1) establish affordability criteria to assist in identifying municipalities that would experience a significant hardship raising revenue for fund projects; (2) establish a list of fund projects that prioritizes water quality improvement projects for FY2011 and thereafter; (3) provide financial assistance to only projects on such list; and (4) provide an explanation if they do not fund projects in priority order.
