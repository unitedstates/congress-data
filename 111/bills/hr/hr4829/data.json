Defines \"9-1-1 services\" as service including both E-911 services and Next Generation 9-1-1 services. Defines \"Next Generation 9-1-1 services\" to mean an IP-based system comprised of hardware, software, data, and operational policies and procedures that: (1) provides standardized interfaces from emergency call and message services to support emergency communications; (2) processes all types of emergency calls, including voice, data, and multimedia information; (3) acquires and integrates additional emergency call data useful to call routing and handling; (4) delivers the emergency calls, messages, and data to the appropriate public safety answering point and other appropriate emergency entities; (5) supports data or video communications needs for coordinated incident response and management; or (6) provides broadband service to public safety answering points or other first responder entities. Requires a report to Congress from: (1) the Administrator of General Services (GSA) identifying the 9-1-1 capabilities of the multi-line telephone system in use by all federal agencies in all federal buildings and properties; and (2) the Comptroller General (GAO) concerning state and local use of 9-1-1 service charges."
