    "text": "State and Local Fleet Efficiency Act - Recognizes state or local government authority to require fleet owners or operators to acquire only new fleet vehicles that: (1) utilize natural gas as a fuel; (2) are flexible fuel vehicles that operate on gasoline, E85, and M85; or (3) meet a technology or performance-based characteristic that is commercially available. Provides that nothing in this Act or in any other provision of law shall limit such authority to establish purchase requirements for fleets operating within the proper jurisdiction if such requirements further any policy regarding climate change, the control of air pollution, energy independence, or local economic benefits. Defines \"fleet\" as a group of 20 or more light duty motor vehicles or medium-duty or heavy-duty motor vehicles carrying 14 or more passengers operating primarily in a metropolitan area with a population of more than 250,000 that are: (1) centrally dispatched; or (2) centrally fueled, or capable of being centrally fueled, and owned, operated, leased, or otherwise controlled by a governmental entity or other person meeting specified criteria."
