Requires such review to assess: (1) the FEMA workforce that administers such grants; (2) any additional resources and staff necessary to carry out management and oversight; (3) coordination with other DHS components with a role in assisting FEMA in managing and administering the grants; and (4) the procedures that grant recipients must follow to obligate and expend their grant awards."
