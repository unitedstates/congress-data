Allows the Secretary to determine appropriate energy efficiency standards for purposes of such guaranteed loans, and to require that dwellings purchased, constructed, or improved meet such standards. Revises current provisions setting the maximum amount allowable for such a loan guaranty to set the maximum amount for such guaranty at 5% of the total value of the property, unless the Secretary specifically approves a higher amount."
