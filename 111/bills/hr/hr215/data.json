Requires any bill or resolution, or its amendment, providing for any increase in such payable rate (other than a pay adjustment recommended by the President under the Federal Salary Act of 1967) to be adopted by the House of Representatives or the Senate only by a recorded vote so as to reflect the vote of each Member."
