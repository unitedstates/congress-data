Requires a public or private entity that redistributes any TARP or ARRA funds to another public or private entity to give the redistributee notice that: (1) such funds are a redistribution of either TARP funds or ARRA funds; and (2) the redistributee may be required to report to the Secretary. Instructs the Secretary to: (1) establish a database to hold all such reported information; (2) make the database information available to the public on the website recovery.gov; and (3) establish a national toll-free telephone hotline number for the public to report waste, fraud, or abuse related to either TARP or ARRA funds. Sets forth whistleblower protections. Amends ARRA to require the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, if it requests that an inspector general conduct or refrain from conducting an audit investigation, to make such request available to the public on the website recovery.gov."
