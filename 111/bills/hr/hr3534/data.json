Requires a certification of responsible stewardship meeting specified due diligence, safety, and environmental requirements as a prerequisite for submission of bids or requests for leases, easements, rights-of-way, or drilling permits. Requires the Secretary, at least 60 days before any lease sale, to request a review by the Secretary of Commerce regarding any impacts on the marine and coastal environment of the proposed sale. (Sec. 207) Requires all sums paid either to the Secretary of the Interior or to the Secretary of the Navy under any OCS lease between June 5, 1950, and the enactment of this Act to be deposited in the Treasury and credited to miscellaneous receipts in specified allocations to: (1) the Land and Water Conservation Fund, (2) the Ocean Resources Conservation and Assistance Fund, and (3) the Historic Preservation Fund. (Sec. 208) Modifies the process for approving OCS geological and geophysical exploration plans. Requires approval of a plan within 90 days (currently 30 days) after its submission if certain criteria are met. Requires a plan to include a scenario for the potential blowout of the well involving the highest potential volume of liquid hydrocarbons, along with a complete description of a response plan to both control the blowout and to manage the accompanying discharge of hydrocarbons, including the likelihood for surface intervention to stop the blowout, the availability of a rig to drill a relief well, an estimate of the time it would take to drill a relief well, a description of other technology to regain control of the well or capture escaping hydrocarbons and the potential timeline for using that technology for its intended purpose, and the strategy, organization, and resources necessary to avoid harm to the environment and human health from hydrocarbons. Requires a plan also to analyze the potential impacts of the worst-case-scenario discharge of hydrocarbons upon marine, coastal, and human environments. Directs the Secretary to require that any lessee operating under an approved exploration plan obtain a permit before: (1) drilling any well in accordance with the plan; and (2) any significant modification of the well design as originally approved by the Secretary. Prohibits the Secretary from granting any drilling permit or modification of the permit before completion of: (1) a full engineering review of the well system, including a determination that critical safety systems, including blowout prevention, will utilize best available technology and include redundancy and remote triggering capability; or (2) a safety and environmental management plan that will be utilized by the operator during all well operations. Conditions the issuance of drilling permits upon a determination by the Secretary that the applicant has available oil spill response and clean-up equipment and technology capable of effectively remediating a worst-case release of oil. Requires the Secretary to treat either the approval or a significant revision of an exploration plan as an agency action requiring an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). Requires the Secretary to disapprove an exploration plan if: (1) exceptional geological conditions in the lease areas, exceptional resource values in the marine or coastal environment, or other exceptional circumstances would probably cause serious harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), to property, to any mineral deposits (in areas leased or not leased), to the national security or defense, or to the marine, coastal, or human environments; (2) the threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and (3) the advantages of disapproving the plan outweigh the advantages of exploration. (Sec. 209) Requires consideration of the availability of infrastructure to support oil spill response in the timing and location of oil and gas exploration, development, and production among OCS oil- and gas-bearing physiographic regions. Revises other specified requirements. Directs the Secretary to implement a research and development program to ensure continued improvement of methodologies for characterizing both OCS resources and the conditions that may affect the ability to develop and use them in a safe, sound, and environmentally responsible manner. (Sec. 210) Changes from once only to at least once every three years the requirement that the Secretary study any area or region included in any oil and gas lease sale or other lease in order to establish information needed for assessment and management of environmental impacts on the human, marine, and coastal environments of the OCS and the coastal areas which may be affected by oil and gas or other mineral development in such area or region. Requires the Secretary, in addition, to conduct these triennial studies in cooperation with the Secretary of Commerce. Directs the Secretary to conduct research to identify and reduce data gaps regarding impacts of certain deepwater hydrocarbon spills; (2) identify and publish an updated list of the best available technologies for key areas of well design and operation, including blowout prevention and blowout and oil spill response and mitigation; (3) promulgate regulations requiring a safety case to be submitted along with each new application for an OCS drilling permit; and (4) implement an offshore technology research, development, and risk assessment program to address safety, environmental protection, and spill response issues. (Sec. 212) Revises requirements for enforcement of safety and environmental regulations. Requires such regulations to provide for: (1) scheduled onsite inspection, at least once a month, of each OCS facility engaged in drilling operations which is subject to any environmental or safety regulation; and (2) periodic audits of each required safety and environmental management plan, and any associated safety case, whether on the OCS or onshore. Requires investigations and reports on each loss of oil well control and any other accident that presented a serious risk to human or environmental safety. Requires holders of leases or permits to cooperate in any investigation as a condition of the lease or the permit. Requires investigation of any allegation from an employee of the lessee or any subcontractor of a violation of a safety regulation. Requires the Secretary to make available promptly to all lessees and the public all technical information about incident causes and corrective actions taken. Instructs the Secretary to require operators of drilling and production operations to certify annually that their operations are in compliance with applicable law and regulations. Prohibits the Secretary from approving any application for a permit to drill a well unless it is accompanied by specified written attestations by the chief executive officer (CEO), including that the applicant has the capability and technology to respond immediately and effectively to a worst-case oil spill in real-world conditions in the area of the proposed activity. Subjects to a civil penalty any CEO who makes a false certification. Requires all operators that modify or upgrade emergency equipment to prevent blow-outs or other well control events to obtain independent third party certification that: (1) the equipment will operate as originally designed, and (2) modifications or upgrades conducted after delivery have not compromised equipment design, performance or functionality. Subjects noncompliance with this requirement to suspension of the lease. (Sec. 214) Increases civil penalties for noncompliance, up to $75,000 for each day of continued failure ($150,000 if the failure threatens harm or damage to life, property, any mineral deposit, or environment). Increases criminal fines for knowing and willful violations from $100,000 to $10 million. Subjects corporate officers and agents to civil penalties for willful disregard in authorizing, ordering, or carrying out proscribed activities. Requires the Secretary to treat the approval of a development and production plan, or a significant revision of a development and plan, as an agency action requiring preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement. (Sec. 215) Places within the purview of the OCSLA all oil and gas development and production in the Gulf of Mexico. Expands the scope and contents of mandatory oil and gas development plans to include a scenario for the potential blowout of each well to be drilled as part of the plan involving the highest potential volume of liquid hydrocarbons, along with a complete description of a response plan to both control the blowout and manage the accompanying discharge of hydrocarbons. (Sec. 216) Requires lessees engaged in drilling operations to provide to the Secretary, within 24 hours in electronic format, all daily reports regarding drilling operations on the lease and documentation of blowout preventer maintenance and repair. Requires prompt or real-time transmission of the electronic log from a blowout preventer control system. (Sec. 217) Prohibits the Secretary from conducting a regular program to take oil and gas lease royalties in oil or gas. (Sec. 218) Revises conflict-of-interest employment restrictions governing former Department of the Interior personnel. Prohibits separated officers or employees of the Department within two years after separation from accepting employment or compensation from any party that has a direct and substantial interest: (1) that was pending under the officer's or employee's official responsibility at any point during the two-year period preceding termination of that responsibility; or (2) in which the officer or employee participated personally and substantially as a Department officer or employee. Extends conflict-of-interest prohibitions to certain prior dealings of full-time officers or employees in which they or their spouse, minor child, or general partner has a financial interest. Prohibits full-time Department officers or employees who directly or indirectly discharge duties or responsibilities under OCSLA from soliciting or accepting, directly or indirectly, any gift in violation of certain regulations. Specifies criminal penalties for violations of conflict-of-interest prohibitions.. (Sec. 219) Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to repeal authority for: (1) royalty incentives for natural gas production from deep wells in shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico; and (2) royalty relief for deep water production in the Gulf of Mexico. Amends OCSLA to repeal the Secretary's authority to reduce or eliminate any royalty or net profit share set forth in leases within the Planning Areas Offshore Alaska. (Sec. 220) Revises manning and buy-and-build-American requirements to require the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating to issue regulations that are supplemental to, and complementary with, but not a substitute for provisions of the U.S. Constitution and federal laws extended to the OCS subsoil and seabed, except with respect to individuals with extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, or business, which has been demonstrated by sustained national or international acclaim. Expresses the intent of Congress to monitor deployment of personnel and material on the OCS in order to encourage development of American technology and manufacturing and enable U.S. workers to benefit from the OCSLA. (Sec. 221) Requires the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling to: (1) consult monthly with engineering and technology experts who are analyzing causes of the oil spill for the National Academy of Engineering and the National Research Council; and (2) report recommendations for improvements to federal laws, regulations, and industry practices applicable to offshore drilling. Grants the Commission subpoena powers.

(Sec. 224) Instructs the Secretary to report on the costs of baseline environmental studies that gather, analyze, and characterize resource data necessary to implement the OCSLA. (Sec. 225) Requires the Secretary of Commerce or of the Interior to incorporate any takings of marine mammal species or stock from any other reasonably foreseeable activities administered under the OCSLA in determining whether takings from specified activities administered under OCSLA will: (1) have a negligible impact on a marine mammal species or stock, and (2) not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of such species or stock for taking for subsistence uses. Subtitle B: Royalty Relief for American Consumers - Royalty Relief for American Consumers Act of 2010 - (Sec. 232) Prohibits the Secretary from issuing a new oil or natural gas production lease to certain lessees unless they have renegotiated each covered lease to modify the lessee's payment responsibilities to require payment of royalties if the price of oil and natural gas is greater than or equal to specified OCSLA price thresholds. Extends such renegotiation requirements to a lessee or any other person who has any direct or indirect interest in, or who derives a benefit from, a lease in order to be eligible to obtain by sale or other transfer (including through a swap, spinoff, servicing, or other agreement) any covered lease, the economic benefit of any covered lease, or any other lease for the production of oil or natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico under the OCSLA. (Sec. 233) Directs the Secretary to agree to a lessee's request to amend certain leases issued for the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico tract to incorporate price thresholds applicable to royalty suspension requirements that are equal to or less than specified OCSLA price thresholds. Declares that existing lease provisions shall prevail through FY2010. Subtitle C: Limitation on Moratorium - (Sec. 241) Shields certain drilling permit applicants from the drilling moratorium dated July 12, 2010, and any consequent suspension of operations on the OCS, if the applicant has complied with a specified notice and recommended additional safety measures and has completed all required safety inspections.

Title III: Oil and Gas Royalty Reform - (Sec. 302) Amends the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 to authorize the Secretary, as an adjunct to audits of accounts for leases, to utilize compliance reviews of accounts. States that the reviews neither constitute nor substitute for audits of lease accounts. Requires any disparity uncovered in a compliance review to be referred immediately to a program auditor. (Sec. 303) Modifies the terms of liability for royalty payments. Treats as the lessee's designee any person who pays, offsets, or credits monies, makes adjustments, requests and receives refunds, or submits reports with respect to payments the lessee must make under such Act. Makes such a designee liable for any payment obligation of any lessee on whose behalf the designee pays royalty under the lease. Eliminates the primary liability for royalty payment obligations of the person owning operating rights in a lease, and the secondary liability of a person owning legal record title in the lease. Makes each such person liable for that person's pro rata share of payment obligations. (Sec. 305) Doubles civil penalties for violations of such Act. Subjects to these penalties any person who knowingly or willfully fails to make prescribed royalty payments, or who fails to provide correct, timely reports on requisite operations or financial records. Tolls the statute of limitations for certain violations committed by oil and gas lessees. (Sec. 306) Prohibits the allowance, payment, or crediting of interest on royalty overpayments.

Title VII: Oil Spill Accountability and Environmental Protection - Oil Spill Accountability and Environmental Protection Act of 2010 - (Sec. 702) Amends the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to: (1) repeal the limits on liability for certain vessels and offshore facilities; (2) direct the President to adjust triennially the liability limits upward to reflect either the amount of liability commensurate with the risk of a discharge of oil presented by a particular category of vessel, facility, or port or any increase in the Consumer Price Index (as under current law), whichever is greater. (Sec. 703) Increases the amount of financial responsibility required for an offshore facility to $300 million. Prescribes evidentiary criteria for an alternative amount of financial responsibility, if the President determines that an amount less than $300 million is justified. Sets mandatory minimum amounts at: (1) $105 million for an offshore facility located seaward of a state's seaward boundary, and (2) $30 million for one located landward. (Sec. 704) Expands the kinds of oil pollution liability to include damages to human health, including fatal injuries. (Sec. 705) Declares that, with respect to treatment of a mobile offshore drilling unit as an offshore facility for excess liability purposes, the circumstance triggering such treatment is any discharge of oil, or substantial threat of a discharge of oil, into or upon the water. (Sec. 706) Subjects to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act any federal, state, or tribal determination or assessment of damages to natural resources resulting from a discharge of oil. (Currently such a determination has the force and effect of a rebuttable presumption.) (Sec. 707) Declares that, with respect to procedures for claims for removal costs or damages against the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, in the event of a spill of national significance, the President may exercise specified authorities to ensure that the presentation, filing, processing, settlement, and adjudication of claims occurs within the states and local governments affected by the spill to the greatest extent practicable. Authorizes the President, furthermore, in such an event, to require a responsible party or a guarantor of a discharge or threat-of-discharge source to provide the President with any information on or related to claims, either individually, in the aggregate, or both, that the President requests. (Sec. 708) States that, with respect to the measure of natural resource damages from an oil discharge, federal officials acting as trustees for natural resources shall: (1) give equal and full consideration to restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and the acquisition of the equivalent of the natural resources under their trusteeship; and (2) consider restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and the acquisition of the equivalent of the natural resources under their trusteeship in a holistic ecosystem context, using, where available, eco-regional or natural resource plans. Requires acquisition to be given full and equal consideration only if it provides a substantially greater likelihood of improving the resilience of the lost or damaged resource and supports local ecological processes. (Sec. 709) Amends federal maritime law to limit to a vessel with a registry endorsement in its certificate of documentation that is owned by a U.S. citizen any support of exploration, development, or production of resources in, on, above, or below the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). (Sec. 710) Requires the safety management system for a mobile offshore drilling unit operating in waters subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including the EEZ) to include processes, procedures, and policies related to the safe operation and maintenance of the machinery and systems on board the vessel that may affect its seaworthiness in a worst-case event. (Sec. 711) Requires the Secretary, prescribing regulations for mobile offshore drilling units, to develop standards to address a worst-case event on the vessel. (Sec. 712) Limits issuance of a license as master of a mobile offshore drilling unit to any applicant with a merchant seaman's master license who has demonstrated the knowledge, understanding, proficiency, and sea service for all the industrial business or functions of a mobile offshore drilling unit. (Sec. 714) Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to: (1) declare a mobile offshore drilling unit ineligible to operate without an approved response plan; and (2) require the President to issue a revised regulation for the development of a schedule for the use of dispersants, other chemicals, and other spill mitigating devices and substances. Directs the EPA Administrator to study the potential risks and impacts to water quality, the environment, or any other appropriate factor, including acute and chronic risks, from the use of dispersants, other chemicals, and other spill mitigating substances, if any, that may be used to carry out the National Contingency Plan.
