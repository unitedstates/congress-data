    "text": "2010 District of Columbia Omnibus Authorization Act - Amends the District of Columbia Appropriation Act, 1982, as amended by the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 1990, to repeal the prohibition against, and so permit, the promotion or operation of revenue-raising games of chance on the federal enclave, its adjacent public buildings, and land controlled by the Shipstead-Luce Act. Amends the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to make permanent the authority to: (1) increase the amount appropriated to the District of Columbia (District) as local funds during a fiscal year attributable to unanticipated growth of revenue collections; and (2) allocate funds from the District emergency and contingency reserve funds, respectively, and use them for cash flow management purposes. Revises certain specifications for the authorized transfer by the District Council, on behalf of the United States, to the District Redevelopment Land Agency of all federal right, title, and interest in the Southwest Waterfront Project Site. Authorizes such transfer by one or more quitclaim deeds. Authorizes the Agency to lease or sell the Site to a redevelopment company or other lessee or purchaser. Repeals the U.S. reversionary interest in such property. Requires the Director of the National Park Service and the Secretary of the Interior each to transfer specified lands to the District. Amends the District of Columbia Official Code to revise the authorities of the chief judge of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals to: (1) provide biennial and, as under current law, annual judicial conferences; and (2) require active magistrate judges at such conferences. Authorizes the chief judges of the District Superior Court and of the District Court of Appeals to toll or delay judicial proceedings in certain natural disaster or other emergency situations. Amends the Code to authorize the Joint Committee on Judicial Administration to establish a voluntary separation incentive payments program for nonjudicial employees of the District courts substantially similar to that for certain federal employees and members of the uniformed services. Amends the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to reduce from 114 to 70 days after a vacancy occurs the timing for special elections for ward council members in the District. Revises the annual salary of the Chief Financial Officer of the District to a rate which is not less than (currently, an annual rate equal to) level I of the Executive Schedule. Deauthorizes a specified portion of the project for navigation, Potomac River, Washington Channel, District of Columbia."
