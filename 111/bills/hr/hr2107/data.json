Directs the Secretary to develop a written patient informed consent document relating to cord blood disposition to be presented to and signed by the expectant woman not later than two weeks before her estimated delivery date. Requires such document to include: (1) information on the different options to cord blood banking; (2) information on the medical value of cord blood stem cells in treating disease; and (3) a declaration, to be signed, of a woman's chosen option for disposition. Directs each physician or other health care professional who is primarily responsible for furnishing ambulatory prenatal care to a pregnant woman to: (1) provide her with timely information relating to umbilical cord blood banking options; and (2) obtain written informed consent or a document that the woman refused or declined to provide such consent. Applies such requirement to state Medicaid plans and group health insurance plans. Directs the Secretary to develop professional educational materials on umbilical cord blood stem cells for health care providers who provide prenatal services. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to entities for targeted education about umbilical cord blood stem cells and the different options for banking such cells."
