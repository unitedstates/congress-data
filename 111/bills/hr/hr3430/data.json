Makes funds available under the Pilot Program for a participating DSH to create and support collaborative care networks that would: (1) assist low-income individuals without adequate health care coverage access and use health services, as well as enroll in applicable public or private health insurance programs; and (2) improve health care by providing case management, application assistance, and appropriate referrals. Directs the Secretary to create within HHS a Collaborative Care Network Center."
