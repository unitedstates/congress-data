Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary: (1) for such activities; and (2) to expand the ExporTech program, requiring preference for activities that assist small- and medium-sized U.S. manufacturers, create or sustain the greatest number of jobs in the United States, and obtain the maximum return on investment. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary should enhance federal collaboration with states on export promotion issues by: (1) training state international trade agency staff to assist the United States and Foreign Commercial Service in providing export services to businesses in their communities; and (2) entering into agreements with such state agencies to deliver export promotion services in their local communities to extend the outreach of Service programs."
