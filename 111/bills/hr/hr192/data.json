Requires the Secretary of the Interior to convey, to the state of Idaho a specified parcel or parcels of BLM land, including roads thereon, for a motorized recreation park. Designates specified parcels of federal land in central Idaho as wilderness areas to be managed as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System (NWPS). Repeals existing law requiring review of portions of the Sawtooth National Recreation Area (SNRA) for possible inclusion in the NWPS. Sets forth provisions concerning the management of federal lands in the Challis National Forest, the Sawtooth National Forest, SNRA, and the Challis District of the BLM that are not designated as wilderness areas under this Act or previous laws. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to complete a study for establishing the Big Wood Backcountry Trail system for mechanized and nonmotorized recreation on a portion of the Rip and Tear Trail inside the SNRA."
