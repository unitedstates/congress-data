Defines \"qualified energy feedstock\" to include manure of livestock, any nonhazardous, organic agricultural or food industry byproduct or waste material derived from renewable biomass, solid wood waste materials, or agricultural or forestry crops. Allows such credit to offset alternative minimum tax (AMT) liability."
