    "text": "Federal Electronic Equipment Donation Act of 2009 - Directs each federal agency to identify useful federal electronic equipment that the agency has determined is excess to its needs and to: (1) report such equipment to the Administrator of General Services (GSA) for processing for transfer to an educational recipient in accordance with provisions relating to the donation of personal property through state agencies; (2) transfer such equipment directly to such a recipient by arrangement with the Administrator; or (3) report such equipment to the Administrator as excess property if transfer is not practicable.Provides procedures, in the transfer of such equipment, for refurbishing for classroom use and data removal.Requires transferring agencies to give the highest preference to educational recipients located in an enterprise community or empowerment zone designated under the Internal Revenue Code or a qualifying small town or county (those with certain levels of poverty). Requires state plans of operation for property transfers to give the same preference.Defines \"educational recipient\" as a school or community-based educational organization. Defines \"federal electronic equipment\" to include computers and peripheral equipment, fax machines, and software (where a license transfer is permitted).Requires a report to Congress from the Administrator on equipment inventories and transfers not later than 18 months after enactment of this Act.States that this Act supersedes Executive Order No. 12999 of April 17, 1996 (entitled \"Educational Technology: Ensuring Opportunity for All Children in the Next Century\")."
