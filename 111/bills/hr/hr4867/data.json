Bars the Secretary from excluding free-roaming wild horses from any part of the Currituck National Wildlife Refuge unless: (1) it is found that the presence of such horses on a part of the Refuge threatens the survival of an endangered species for which such land is designated as critical habitat; (2) such finding is based on a peer-reviewed scientific assessment; and (3) a period of public notice and comment is provided on that finding."
