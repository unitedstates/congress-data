Imposes a fine and/or prison term of up to 10 years for failure to report such travel. Requires diplomatic or consular missions in each foreign country to establish and maintain a countrywide sex offender registry for sex offenders from the United States who temporarily or permanently reside in such country. Directs the Commissioner of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to issue directives for the assessment of sex offenders whose travel is reported to determine whether such offenders are high risk sex offenders. Directs the President to establish the International Sex Offender Travel Center to monitor the travel of high risk sex offenders. Authorizes the Secretary of State to rescind the passports of individuals awaiting trial for a sex offense against a minor or a permanent resident who has been convicted of such an offense. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to make convicted sex offenders inadmissible to the United States. Amends the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 to include in the annual report of the Secretary of State on the status of severe forms of human trafficking efforts of foreign countries to identify and provide notice of international travel by sex offenders. Encourages the President to use authorities under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to assist foreign countries in identifying and providing notice of sex offenders traveling to the United States and other countries. Sets forth reporting requirements relating to the travel of international sex offenders and the implementation of this Act."
