Declares the sense of Congress that private entities should not: (1) use Social Security account numbers as a method identifying individuals on documents made available to the public or on personal identification cards; or (2) include on any such document or card a magnetic strip, bar code, or other means of communication which conveys such number (or a derivative)."
