    "text": "E-Rate 2.0 Act of 2010 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to direct the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to implement a five-year pilot program which distributes funding to secondary schools participating in the E-Rate program (which provides discounted telecommunications services to certain schools and libraries) so that they can provide residential broadband service vouchers to students who are eligible to participate in the school lunch program and have a computer at home. Includes community colleges and Head Start agencies in the E-Rate program. Directs the FCC to implement a pilot program that, for the five years following this Act's enactment, is the exclusive source of federal funding for broadband equipment and services for community colleges and Head Start agencies. Requires the FCC to implement a four-year pilot program that allows secondary schools that are eligible for the highest percentage discounted rates under the E-Rate program to apply for meaningfully discounted services and technologies for the use of electronic books. Directs the FCC to: (1) develop and implement policies and procedures to streamline and simplify the E-Rate program application process; and (2) complete the proceeding to revise the E-Rate program funding cap so that the cap accounts for inflation."
