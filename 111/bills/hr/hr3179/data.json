Instructs the SIG to include, in quarterly reports to Congress, information on actions by the Secretary and any financial institutions receiving TARP assistance to include and utilize minorities and women, and minority- and women-owned businesses, in any solicitation or contract. Requires such reports to include information on: (1) the levels of inclusion and utilization of women, minorities, and women- and minority-owned businesses; (2) the type of such contracts or solicitations, their dollar amounts, and the total number of them; and (5) any other activities to increase the participation of women, minorities, and women- and minority-owned businesses, including recommendations."
