    "text": "American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 - Sets forth provisions concerning clean energy, energy efficiency, reducing global warming pollution, transitioning to a clean energy economy, and providing for agriculture and forestry related offsets. Includes provisions: (1) creating a combined energy efficiency and renewable electricity standard and requiring retail electricity suppliers to meet 20% of their demand through renewable electricity and electricity savings by 2020; (2) setting a goal of, and requiring a strategic plan for, improving overall U.S. energy productivity by at least 2.5% per year by 2012 and maintaining that improvement rate through 2030; and (3) establishing a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and setting goals for reducing such emissions from covered sources by 83% of 2005 levels by 2050. (Sec. 3) Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA Administrator) to report annually to Congress on whether China and India have adopted GHG emissions standards that are at least as strict as the standards under this Act. Title I: Clean Energy - Subtitle A: Combined Efficiency and Renewable Electricity Standard - (Sec. 101) Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) to establish a combined efficiency and renewable electricity standard that requires each retail electric supplier that sells more than 4 million megawatt hours of electricity to consumers for purposes other than resale to supply an increasing percentage of its demand each year (6% in 2012, 9.5% in 2014, 13% in 2016, 16.5% in 2018, and 20% in 2020-2039) from a combination of electricity savings and renewable electricity.. Defines: (1) \"renewable electricity\" as electricity generated from a renewable energy resource or other qualifying energy resources; (2) \"renewable energy resource\" as wind, solar, and geothermal energy, renewable biomass, biogas and biofuels derived exclusively from renewable biomass, qualified hydropower, and marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy; and (3) \"other qualifying energy resource\" as landfill gas, wastewater treatment gas, coal mine methane used to generate electricity at or near the mine mouth, and qualified waste-to-energy. Requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), in establishing regulations to implement the standard, to: (1) incorporate best practices of existing state and tribal renewable electricity programs; and (2) provide for the issuance, tracking, verification, and identification of renewable electricity credits (RECs). Requires each retail electric supplier to submit to FERC: (1) an amount of RECs and demonstrated total annual electricity savings equal to the supplier's annual combined target (the product of the specified annual percentage and the supplier's base amount of electricity sold in such year); and (2) RECs equal to at least three quarters of such target. Authorizes FERC, upon request from a state's governor, to increase the proportion of a supplier's target that may be met with electricity savings to no more than two fifths. Requires FERC to: (1) issue to each generator of renewable electricity a REC for each megawatt hour of renewable electricity generated after December 31, 2011; (2) issue three RECs for each megawatt hour of renewable electricity generated by an existing distributed renewable generation facility; and (3) review the effect of issuing three RECs and to reduce such number for any given energy source or technology to ensure that such number is no higher than is necessary to make such facilities using such source or technology cost competitive with other sources of renewable electricity generation. Provides for the issuance of RECs for qualified hydropower, electricity generated from qualified waste, and electricity generated using both a renewable energy resource and a nonrenewable resource. Authorizes: (1) the holder of a REC to sell, exchange, transfer, and bank a REC and to submit it for compliance or retirement; and (2) a REC to be submitted for the compliance year in which it was issued or for any of the three immediately subsequent compliance years. Requires FERC to prescribe standards that: (1) define and measure electricity savings from energy efficiency and energy conservation measures; and (2) require third-party verification of savings. Authorizes a retail electric supplier to use electricity savings transferred through a bilateral contract from another supplier, an owner of an electric distribution facility that is not a supplier, a state, or a third-party efficiency provider to meet compliance obligations. Requires: (1) a retail electric supplier to report to FERC on its annual electricity savings; and (2) FERC to review such reports and exclude any savings that have not been adequately demonstrated in accordance with such standards. Provides that this Act does not limit or affect the authority of a state to require a retail electric supplier to obtain authorization or approval of a contract for transfer of savings. Authorizes suppliers to submit to the state(s) in which they are located a payment of $25 (adjusted for inflation annually) in lieu of each REC or megawatt hour of demonstrated total annual electricity savings that would otherwise be due. Requires states to use such payments exclusively for: (1) deploying technologies that generate electricity from renewable energy resources; or (2) implementing cost-effective energy efficiency programs to achieve electricity savings. Authorizes a central procurement state to request and assume responsibility for compliance with such retail electric supplier requirements for electricity sold in the state. Sets forth provisions concerning enforcement and judicial review of such combined efficiency and renewable electricity standard. Terminates regulations concerning such standard on December 31, 2040.
