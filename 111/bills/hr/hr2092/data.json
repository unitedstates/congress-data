States that title in the Islands and the related easements shall revert back to the United States 60 days after the Secretary of Interior notifies the District in writing that a portion of the District is not using them for the recreational, environmental, or educational purposes of the National Children's Island, in accordance with the Anacostia Waterfront Framework Plan or the Comprehensive Plan."
