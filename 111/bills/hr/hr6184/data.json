Directs the Secretary to ensure that the evaluation of permits carried out using such funds: (1) is reviewed by the District Commander of the Corps District in which the project or activity is located (or the Commander's designee), or by the Commander of the Corps Division in which the District is located if the permit evaluation is initially conducted by the District Commander; and (2) utilizes the same procedures for decisions that would otherwise be required for the evaluation of permits for similar projects or activities not carried out using such funds. Prohibits funds contributed for the evaluation of permits from being used for such review.Directs the Secretary to ensure that all final permit decisions carried out using such funds are made available to the public, including on the Internet.Requires the budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, to be determined by reference to the latest statement titled \"Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation\" for this Act submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage."
