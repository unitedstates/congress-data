Allows a state or local government and a private nonprofit facility to choose whether or not to repair, restore, reconstruct, or replace one or more of such facilities after assessing the need.Sets the federal cost share for a public facility at 100% of: (1) the federal estimate of the cost of repairing, restoring, reconstructing, or replacing the facilities; and (2) management expenses."
