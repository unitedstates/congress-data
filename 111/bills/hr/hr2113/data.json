Requires each large employer to identify on all records and reports each establishment and whether one has been acquired, sold, or transferred since the last report required under this Act. Requires the Secretary to issue citations under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to any large employer, including those with establishments in states with an approved state plan for development and enforcement of standards, for violations of any of this Act's reporting requirements. Excludes from the meaning of \"establishment\" a place where business is conducted that has fewer than 10 employees or that is in the construction industry."
