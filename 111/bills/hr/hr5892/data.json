Title II: General Provisions - (Sec. 2001) Amends the Flood Control Act of 1970 to direct the Secretary, in any case in which a specific provision of law provides for a nonfederal interest to receive credit toward the nonfederal share of the cost of a study for, or construction or operation and maintenance of, a water resources project, to apply: (1) the specific provision of law; or (2) at the request of the nonfederal interest, the specific provision of law and such provisions of this Act as the nonfederal interest may request. Defines \"water resources project\" to include projects studied, reviewed, designed, constructed, operated and maintained, or otherwise subject to federal participation under the authority of the civil works program of the Secretary for the purposes of navigation, flood damage reduction, ecosystem restoration, hurricane and storm damage reduction, water supply, recreation, hydroelectric power, fish and wildlife conservation, water quality, environmental infrastructure, resource protection and development, and related purposes. (Sec. 2002) Amends the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 1986 to require mitigation for impacts to ecological resources, including both terrestrial and aquatic resources. Requires the Secretary to: (1) identify in a report to Congress the basis for any determination that mitigation to in-kind conditions is not possible; and (2) ensure that the mitigation plan for each water resources project complies at a minimum (currently, complies) with the mitigation standards and policies established pursuant to the regulatory programs administered by the Secretary. (Sec. 2003) Amends the WRDA of 2007 to make provisions of such Act authorizing the Secretary to recommend harbor and navigation improvement projects without the need to demonstrate that such projects are justified solely by national economic development benefits applicable to a feasibility study (as defined in the WRDA of 1986) or a detailed project report (as defined in the River and Harbor Act of 1960). (Sec. 2004) Amends the WRDA of 2007 to provide that any revision to a partnership agreement providing for the participation of the federal government in a water resources project shall be effective without regard to whether the original partnership agreement was entered into before, on, or after the enactment of this Act. (Sec. 2005) Amends the WRDA of 2007 to add requirements applicable to the Chief of Engineers relating to peer reviews of water resources project studies, including a requirement to make public and submit to Congress peer review reports on water projects. (Sec. 2006) Makes the Federal Advisory Committee Act inapplicable to a safety assurance review conducted under the WRDA of 2007.

Directs the Secretary to ensure that the evaluation of permits carried out using such funds: (1) is reviewed by the District Commander of the Corps District in which the project or activity is located, unless the evaluation of the permit is initially conducted by the District Commander, in which case the review shall be conducted by the Commander of the Corps Division in which the District is located; and (2) utilizes the same procedures for decisions that would otherwise be required for the evaluation of permits for similar projects or activities not carried out using such funds. Prohibits such funds from being used to carry out such review. Directs the Secretary to ensure that all final permit decisions carried out using such funds are made available to the public, including on the Internet. (Sec. 2009) Amends the WRDA of: (1) 1986 to raise the cap for the maximum federal expenditure on any single modification or measure for improvement of the environment; (2) 1996 to raise the cap for the maximum federal expenditure for a project at any single locality for ecosystem and estuary restoration; and (3) 1990 to designate all activities performed by personnel under the direction of the Secretary in connection with the operation and maintenance of navigation infrastructure, including floodgates, locks, and dams, as inherently governmental functions and not commercial activities. (Sec. 2012) Repeals provisions of the WRDA of 2000 limiting the performance of specialized or technical services by the Corps of Engineers, including an annual reporting requirement. (Sec. 2013) Amends the WRDA of 1986 to direct the Secretary, in preparing a feasibility report for a water resources project, to include in the report and any budget documents an accounting of the total cost of the recommended plan and an estimate of the federal and nonfederal participation in the plan based on the following scenarios: (1) the project cost based on optimal levels of federal funding; (2) the estimated project cost based on a 50% increase in the implementation period; and (3) the estimated project cost based on a 100% increase in that period. (Sec. 2014) Amends the WRDA of 2007 to require the Secretary, in reporting to Congress on the status of all projects that require mitigation under the WRDA of 1986, to: (1) use a uniform methodology for determining the status of all projects included in the report; (2) use a methodology that describes both a qualitative and quantitative status for all such projects; and (3) provide specific dates for and participants in consultations relating to mitigation plans required under the WRDA of 1986. (Sec. 2015) Prohibits the use of funds authorized or made available by this Act for a project unless all of the iron, steel, and manufactured goods used in the project are produced in the United States, with exceptions relating to the public interest, availability, and project cost. Requires the Secretary to publish any request for a waiver of this requirement and the justification for such waiver. Title III: Project-Related Provisions - (Sec. 3001) Modifies federal funding limits and other requirements for various water resources projects in specified states.
