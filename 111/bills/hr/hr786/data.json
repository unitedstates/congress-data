Amends the FDIA to: (1) extend from five years to eight years the period during which the restoration plan for the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) must rebuild its statutory reserve ratio; (2) increase to $100 billion the borrowing authority of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); and (3) authorize the FDIC to impose special assessments upon depository institution holding companies to recover losses to the DIF. Amends the FCUA to: (1) increase to $6 billion the borrowing authority of the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA); and (2) require the NCUA Board to establish a Share Insurance Fund (SIF) restoration plan whenever the Board projects that the SIF equity ratio will fall below, or the SIF equity ratio actually does fall below, the required minimum amount. Sets forth restoration plan requirements."
