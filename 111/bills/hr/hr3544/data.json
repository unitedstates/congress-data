Requires the Secretary, in conducting an annual performance measure of the percentage of veterans served by a cemetery, to: (1) use census tracts, rather than counties, to test and identify potential cemetery locations and to determine the percentage of veterans served; (2) use methods to avoid the double counting of veterans in overlapping service areas; and (3) count veterans who reside in counties bisected by a service area using a proportional overlay method."
