Directs the Secretary of Labor to provide rules setting forth the form and manner in which prompt notice to individuals of such continued coverage shall be made. Allows a state to enforce the provisions of this Act with respect to COBRA continuation coverage provided under a state program. Provides that this Act shall: (1) have no effect on termination of continuation coverage for any reason other than expiration of a period of a specified number of months; and (2) supersede any provision of the law of a state or political subdivision that limits or precludes access by a qualified beneficiary, whose COBRA continuation coverage has been extended under this Act, to a state high risk pool established under PPACA solely by reason of such extension."
