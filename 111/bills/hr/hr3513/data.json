Directs the Attorney General to notify the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security of individuals, including aliens, who are convicted of sex offenses against children. Requires the Secretary of State to deny passports for such individuals and authorizes the Secretary to revoke, restrict, or limit a passport issued to a convicted sex offender if the passport was used to transport a minor for illicit sexual purposes. Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to place aliens convicted of sex offenses in removal proceedings. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to: (1) render aliens who are convicted of sexual abuse of a minor inadmissible to the United States; and (2) subject aliens convicted of a sex crime against a minor to deportation."
