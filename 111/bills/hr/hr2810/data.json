Requires the Secretary to establish the Public Health Workforce Loan Repayment Program to provide for the repayment of loans incurred by individuals in the pursuit of the relevant public health workforce educational degree or certificate in exchange for working at public health agencies or centers for at least three years. Requires the Secretary to award grants to public health agencies that receive public health cooperative agreements from HHS to operate state, local, and tribal public health workforce loan repayment programs. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to, or enter into contracts with, any eligible entity to award scholarships to eligible individuals to enroll in degree or professional training programs for the purpose of enabling mid-career professionals in the public health workforce to receive additional training in the field of public health. Requires the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in cooperation with the Secretary, to ensure that included in the OPM website there is an online catalogue, or a link to an online catalogue, of public health workforce employment opportunities in the federal government. Requires the Secretary to award competitive grants to establish or maintain Academic Health Departments to provide for collaboration between the academic and practice aspects of public health. Sets forth licensure or certification exam requirements for social workers participating in the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment program."
