Requires the Secretary of the military department concerned to consult with the member regarding the repayment rate, taking into account the financial ability of the member to pay and avoiding the imposition of undue hardship on the member and his or her dependents. Provides specified delays in collection of overpayments from members injured or wounded during hostile action or incurring a wound, injury, or illness during active duty in a combat operation or combat zone. Imposes a five-year statute of limitations on the collection of overpayments. Allows for the cancellation of repayment when the Secretary concerned determines that the person: (1) relies on social security benefits or disability compensation for more than half the person's annual income; or (2) would suffer undue hardship in repaying the indebtedness."
