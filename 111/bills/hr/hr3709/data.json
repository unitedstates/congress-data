Includes as such conditions that sufficient data has been submitted by a qualified geothermal professional to the relevant federal land management agency to engender a belief that: (1) there is a valid discovery of geothermal or geothermal steam resources on the lands for which the lessee holds the right to develop the resources; and (2) the thermal feature extends into the adjoining areas."
