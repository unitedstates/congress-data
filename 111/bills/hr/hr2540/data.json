Applies the oil shale management final rules published by the Department of the Interior on November 18, 2008, to all commercial leasing for the management of federally owned oil shale, and any associated minerals, located on federal lands. Authorizes the Secretary to reduce temporarily any royalties, fees, rentals, bonus, or other payments for leases of federal lands for oil shale resources development and production as necessary to incentivize and encourage development of such resources, if the Secretary determines that such payments, otherwise authorized by law, are hindering production of such resources."
