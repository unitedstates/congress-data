Authorizes a consular official to issue a temporary tourist/business visa to a Cuban national (who is not otherwise inadmissible) whose itinerary documents an intent to conduct activities, including phytosanitary inspections, related to purchasing U.S. agricultural goods under the provisions of the Act. Amends the Act to define \"payment in cash in advance\" as the payment by the purchaser of an agricultural commodity or product and the receipt of payment by the seller prior to the transfer of title and release of control of the commodity or product to the purchaser. Prohibits the President from restricting direct transfers from a Cuban financial institution to a U.S. financial institution executed in payment for a product authorized for sale under the Act."
