Amends the Public Health Service Act to provide for the establishment and governance of individual membership associations (IMAs) to make available health benefits coverage to all members of the IMA. Requires an IMA to be operated under the direction of an association which: (1) has been actively in existence for at least five years; (2) has been formed and maintained in good faith for purposes other than obtaining insurance; and (3) does not condition membership in the association on any health status-related factor relating to an individual. Prohibits an IMA from offering health benefits coverage to a member of an IMA unless the same coverage is offered to all members of the IMA. Sets forth requirements for health benefits coverage offered through an IMA, including that such coverage must be: (1) provided only through contracts with health insurance issuers with no risk assumed by the IMAs; and (2) underwritten by a health insurance issuer that is licensed and in compliance with state law. Supersedes specified state laws related to health benefits coverage made available through an IMA. Gives funds to states for a high-risk pool, a reinsurance pool, or other risk-adjustment mechanism used for the purpose of subsidizing the purchase of health insurance coverage for the high-risk population."
