Directs the Secretary to give priority to individuals who agree to serve in community health centers in designated health professional shortage areas. Sets forth factors for the Secretary to consider in determining the amount to pay for each year of service. Directs the Secretary to provide additional reimbursements for the individual's tax liability resulting from such payments."
