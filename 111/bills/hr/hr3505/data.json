    "text": "American Energy Production and Price Reduction Act - Expresses the sense of Congress that at no time shall Congress enact legislation that will lead to the increase of domestic energy prices. Amends the Submerged Lands Act to: (1) revise the seaward boundaries of states from three geographical miles to 12 nautical miles; and (2) retain as federal property all oil and gas mineral rights for lands beneath the navigable waters located within such expanded offshore state seaward boundaries. Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) to revise requirements for: (1) the determination of Adjacent Zones and Planning Areas; (2) lease administration and granting of leases; and (3) treatment of receipts from tracts within specified miles of a state coastline. Revamps procedures for the reservation of lands and rights. Authorizes the President to revoke or revise prior withdrawals from leasing within certain areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Revises the OCS leasing program. Prescribes a program for approval of pipeline construction (including a petroleum products pipeline) within part of an Adjacent State's Adjacent Zone. Cites conditions under which leases and exploration activities are categorically excluded from the need to prepare an environmental assessment or impact statement. Prescribes procedures for federal repurchase of certain leases, including oil and gas leases. Permits offsite environmental mitigation. Sets forth procedures for the exchange of specified leases within the California or Florida Adjacent Zone. Repeals: (1) the coastal impact assistance program; and (2) the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. American Energy Independence and Price Reduction Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to implement a competitive leasing program for oil and gas exploration, development, and production on the Alaska Coastal Plain. Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 to repeal the prohibition against leasing or other development regarding production of oil and gas from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Deems any oil and gas leasing programs and activities authorized by this Act to be in compliance with ANWR purposes. Authorizes the Secretary to designate specified acres of the Coastal Plain as a Special Area, after consultation with the state of Alaska, the city of Kaktovik, and the North Slope Borough. Permits directional drilling in the Special Area. Prescribes procedures governing Coastal Plain lease sales. Prescribes a \"no significant adverse effect\" standard to govern Coastal Plain activities. Prohibits the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) from denying a license application under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 on the grounds that sufficient capacity does not exist, or will not become available on a timely basis, for disposal of spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste from the facility for which the authorization is sought. Amends the Internal Revenue Code: (1) to prescribe an ASME Nuclear Certification credit of 15% of the qualified nuclear expenditures paid or incurred by the taxpayer; and (2) repeal the deduction for income attributable to domestic production activities. Amends the Clean Air Act to exclude from the term \"air pollutant\" carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, or sulfur hexafluoride. Declares the Clean Air Act shall not be treated as authorizing or requiring the regulation of climate change or global warming. Amends the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) to set forth procedures for judicial review of federal agency compliance. Amends the Clean Air Act to repeal specified amendments to the renewable fuel standard. Amends the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2009, to repeal the requirement to consult regarding impacts on global warming and the polar bear population. Amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to repeal lighting energy efficiency standards for general service incandescent lamps and other designated lamps. Emergency Solar Power Permit Act - Amends NEPA to exempt any action relating to a solar energy project on lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) from environmental impact statement (EIS) requirements. Directs the Secretary of Energy to conduct a five-year natural gas vehicle research and development program. Amends the IRC to: (1) make permanent alternative fuel credits for compressed or liquefied natural gas and the vehicles powered by such gas; (2) allow vehicle and infrastructure credits against regular and minimum tax and transferability of credits; (3) grant a credit for producing vehicles fueled by natural or liquefied natural gas; (4) grant a special allowance for coal-to-liquid plant property in the accelerated cost recovery system; and (5) extend permanently the credit for nonbusiness energy property and the credit for gas produced from biomass and for synthetic fuels produced from coal. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to authorize appropriations for large-scale coal-to-liquid facilities. Directs the Secretary to establish a coal-to-liquid facilities loan and loan guarantee programs. Amends the IRC to: (1) provide for a seven-year depreciation for clean coal technology or for carbon sequestration technology installed or retrofitted at power-plants; (2) extend the 50-cent per gallon alternative fuels excise tax credit; and (3) allow a tax credit for 30% of the expenditures made by an individual or business for energy production and distribution facilities. Directs the Internal Revenue Service to treat the synthetic gas produced from coal-to-liquids with the same tax treatment as covered by the industrial gasification tax credit. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to provide clean coal technology loan guarantees and direct loans for research, development, and deployment of clean coal technology in order to build up to five commercial-scale coal-fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration capabilities. Instructs the Secretary of the Interior to undertake a national assessment of carbon dioxide storage capacity. Directs the Secretary of Energy to conduct and report to certain congressional committees on an efficiency audit, and quantify the operating efficiencies, of all coal-fired electric generation facilities in the United States. Amends the IRC to extend specified tax incentives for energy, among them credits for: (1) energy efficient appliances; (2) nonbusiness energy property; (3) residential energy efficient property; and (4) new energy efficient homes."
