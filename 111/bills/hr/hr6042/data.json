Prohibits any deduction from\u00a0the burial allowance\u00a0because of a veteran's assets or because of any contribution toward\u00a0the burial and funeral\u00a0expenses,\u00a0unless the expenses incurred are covered by the United States, a state, an agency or political subdivision of the United States or a state, or the veteran's employer."
