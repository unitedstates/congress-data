Authorizes the Fund to establish the America for Haitian Private Sector Development Foundation which shall develop programs to recruit qualified individuals from the United States, including the Haitian diaspora in the United States, to provide technical expertise to the Haitian government to support public functions and to fill capacity gaps in the Haitian government, especially at ministries that oversee the private sector and were disrupted by the January 12, 2010, earthquake. Requires the President to submit an annual report to Congress, through 2016, summarizing all reports available to the President that were prepared for the purpose of providing oversight and evaluation of earthquake recovery and redevelopment activities conducted by U.S. government agencies during the preceding year."
