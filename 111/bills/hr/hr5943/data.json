Defines \"qualified indebtedness\" to mean any indebtedness incurred or assumed by a partnership or other taxpayer before January 1, 2009, which is secured by commercial real property. Requires a recapture in income of any deduction taken by a partnership if such partnership incurs additional indebtedness within three years after receiving a qualified debt reduction equity investment under this Act."
