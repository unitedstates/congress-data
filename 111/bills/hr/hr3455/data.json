Limits the application of this Act to employees with respect to whom the obligation of Delphi Corporation or General Motors Corporation to provide health care coverage has been discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding. Directs the Secretary to make available up to $3 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds, under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA), to provide health care coverage that is substantially the same as the coverage the obligation for which was so discharged."
