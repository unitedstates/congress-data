(Currently, this benefits transfer option applies only to the Secretary of Defense [DOD] and members of the Armed Forces.) Requires such personnel, at the time their benefits transfer request is approved, to have completed: (1) six years of service in the Public Health Service or NOAA Corps and agreed to serve at least four more; or (2) the years of service determined by the appropriate Secretary. Authorizes the transfer to family members of up to 36 months of unused post-9/11 educational assistance, although the appropriate Secretary may limit such transfer to as little as 18 months of assistance."
