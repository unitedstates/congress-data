Defines \"appropriate preventive care\" to mean medical care that meets the most recent Bright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents. Prohibits a group health plan from imposing any cost-sharing for such preventive services. Prohibits a group health plan from taking specified actions to avoid the requirements of this Act. Applies the provisions of this Act to individual health insurance coverage. Excludes a plan from being treated as a high deductible health plan unless the requirements of this Act are met."
