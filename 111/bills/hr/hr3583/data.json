Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide technical assistance to American Samoa through grants in specified per metric ton amounts to sellers and buyers of whole tuna directly delivered to tuna processors located within American Samoa for processing in American Samoa. States that a grantee may be eligible either as a seller of direct-delivered whole tuna or as a processor buying direct-delivered whole tuna. Exempts such grants from inclusion as gross income under the Internal Revenue Code. Establishes: (1) an annual fee for vessels that make less than three direct deliveries of whole tuna to processors on American Samoa for processing in American Samoa; and (2) a per ton fee for each delivery by a U.S.-documented vessel that delivers tuna to another vessel or other location for transshipment. Establishes within the Treasury the American Samoa Economic Development Trust Fund."
