    "text": "Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to: (1) prohibit the export of restricted electronic waste to countries that are not members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development or the European Union, or Liechtenstein; (2) require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), annually, to identify countries that permit trade in used electronic equipment and parts; and (3) impose criminal penalties for knowingly exporting restricted electronic waste in violation of this Act. Allows certain exceptions to such export ban. Defines \"restricted electronic waste\" to include electronic equipment, such as computers, televisions, printers, copiers, video players, and similar used electronic products, that contain circuit boards and other parts containing mercury or polychlorinated biphenyls, antimony, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, or lead and cathode ray tubes and batteries containing lead and other toxic ingredients."
