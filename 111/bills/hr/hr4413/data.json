Allows the Secretary to guarantee up to 80% of the loan amount for projects for the construction or the expansion, including renovation and modernization, of such infrastructure. Directs the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) under which the Board shall: (1) conduct an evaluation of such development under this Act; and (2) review and recommend best practices for the development of U.S. science parks, including metrics for their success."
