    "text": "Diabetes Prevention Act of 2009 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to establish a national diabetes prevention program targeted at persons at high risk for diabetes. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to recognized eligible entities to: (1) support community-based diabetes prevention program model sites that work with the health care delivery system to identify such high risk persons and to refer them to, or provide them with, cost-effective group-based lifestyle intervention programs; and (2) evaluate methods for ensuring the scalability of recognized community-based diabetes prevention program sites nationally, the health and economic benefits of a national diabetes prevention program for high risk persons in certain age groups, emerging approaches to identify and engage persons at high risk in health care and community-based programs, novel strategies for linking community-based program delivery with existing clinical services, and the costs and cost effectiveness of clinic-community linkages. Directs the Secretary to develop and implement: (1) a program under which the Secretary recognizes, annually, eligible entities that deliver community-based diabetes prevention programs; (2) a curriculum development and training program for diabetes prevention master and lifestyle intervention instructors; (3) community outreach programs to identify community and provider groups to participate in the national diabetes prevention program and coordinate quality assurance programs at the local level in partnership with community-based organizations; and (4) a national partner outreach program to identify and work with national partners to identify workers in the community to complete instructor training and to facilitate the recognition of eligible entities to deliver community-based diabetes prevention programs. Requires the Secretary to: (1) provide quality assurance for each community-based diabetes prevention program model site funded under this Act and for other recognized community-based diabetes prevention programs; and (2) award grants to eligible entities to conduct diabetes prevention research. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct or support studies to manage, reduce, and prevent type-2 diabetes in at-risk populations."
