    "text": "Preventing Social Security Fraud Act of 2010 - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act to require an insurance issuer providing private disability insurance coverage, at the time at which the issuer takes specified action which constitutes a presumed entitlement benefit reduction, to certify to the Commissioner of Social Security that there is reasonable cause to assume that the individual covered by the disability insurance is under a disability and is, or upon application would be, entitled to disability insurance benefits. Specifies such an action as one which has the effect of reducing an individual's covered benefits by reason of the individual's failure to: (1) apply for disability insurance benefits or child's, widow's, or widower's insurance benefits based on disability; or (2) timely request a hearing (or an administrative review prior to such a hearing) with respect to such benefits. Requires the Commissioner to include on any benefits application form a question as to whether the applicant has been requested by the insurance issuer, or any other person on the issuer's behalf, to file the application. Provides penalties for furnishing or causing to be furnished false information in such a certification or failing to timely provide such certification in order to willfully, knowingly, and with intent to deceive the Commissioner."
