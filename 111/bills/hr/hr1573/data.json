Requires the Secretary of Energy to establish procedures and techniques for home energy audits that: (1) establish priorities for selection of energy savings improvements based on their cost-effectiveness, payback period, and contribution to energy savings; (2) measure the energy requirement of individual dwellings and the rate of return of the total energy savings investment in a dwelling; and (3) account for interaction among energy savings measures. Sets forth requirements concerning loan eligibility and repayment. Limits the total loan amount to a single homeowner to $10,000."
