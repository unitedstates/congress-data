Directs the Secretary, in making such a declaration, to consider: (1) the level of threat the disease poses to affected wildlife populations; (2) the sufficiency of resources available in the Wildlife Disease Emergency Fund; (3) the ability of the Department of the Interior and other federal, state, and local agencies, tribal governments, and other stakeholders to address and coordinate a response to the disease through other authorities; and (4) any state governor's request for such a declaration. Establishes in the Treasury a Wildlife Disease Emergency Fund, which shall be available to the Secretary for activities authorized by this Act. Directs the Secretary to establish a Wildlife Disease Committee to assist the Secretary in increasing the level of preparedness of the United States to address emerging wildlife diseases. Authorizes the Secretary to convene rapid response teams to address a wildlife disease emergency."
