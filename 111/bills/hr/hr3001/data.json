    "text": "Ending LGBT Health Disparities Act - Sets forth provisions concerning the health of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend the tax exclusion for employer-provided health care benefits to eligible beneficiaries of the employee and the qualifying children of such beneficiaries. Limits preexisting condition exclusions. Requires parity in the rights and obligations of a federal employee (defined to exclude members of the uniformed services) with a domestic partner and a married employee and the spouse. Expands the definition of \"spouse\" and \"married\" for purposes of Medicare. Phases out the 24-month waiting period for eligibility for hospital insurance benefits under Medicare. Prohibits discrimination: (1) on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity under Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP, formerly known as SCHIP), Medicare, the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program; and (2) on the basis of sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation by the Secretary of Defense against a former member of uniformed services entitled to medical care, and by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to support demonstration projects to improve the health and health care of sexual or gender minorities. Establishes within the Office of Minority Health an Office of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Health to be headed by a Deputy Assistant Secretary for LGBT Health. Requires the HHS Secretary, acting through the Deputy Assistant Secretary, to establish the Center for Cultural Competence in Health Care. Provides for expanded research concerning sexual and gender minority individuals and the collection of sexual or gender minority data in health programs and surveys. Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act to provide benefits to surviving same-sex parents."
