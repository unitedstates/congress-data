Subjects officers and directors of a corporation to personal liability for civil money penalties for violating this prohibition. Exempts from this prohibition any corporation whose aggregate disbursements for electioneering communications during a year: (1) are less than $8,000, if the corporation has fewer than 100 full-time-equivalent (FTE) employees; or (2) are less than $20,000, if the corporation has more than 100 FTE employees. Declares that nothing in this Act shall affect political disbursements by a separate segregated fund established by a corporation."
