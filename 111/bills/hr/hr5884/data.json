Requires the FTC through such office: (1) to disseminate to seniors and their families and caregivers information on mail, telemarketing, television, and Internet fraud targeting seniors, including on ways of referring complaints to appropriate law enforcement agencies; (2) in response to a request about a particular entity or individual, to provide publicly available information on any record of civil or criminal law enforcement action for such fraud; and (3) to maintain a website as a resource for such individuals on those kinds of fraud. Requires the FTC through such office to establish procedures to: (1) log and acknowledge complaints from individuals who certify that they believe they have been victims of mail, telemarketing, television, or Internet fraud; (2) provide certain information on those kinds of fraud; and (3) refer such complaints to appropriate entities, including state consumer protection agencies and entities and appropriate law enforcement agencies, for potential law enforcement action."
