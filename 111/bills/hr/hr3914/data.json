    "as": "Reported to House amended",

    "text": "San Juan Mountains Wilderness Act of 2010 - (Sec. 3) Designates specified lands in the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison National Forests, as well as in the San Juan Resource Area of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in Colorado as wilderness areas and components of the National Wilderness Preservation System (NWPS). (Sec. 4) Designates specified lands in such National Forests and the San Juan National Forest as the Sheep Mountain Special Management Area. Requires activities within the Area to be managed to maintain such Area's presently existing wilderness character and potential for inclusion in the NWPS. Prohibits the construction of permanent roads, the use of motor vehicles, motorized equipment, or mechanical transport (except as necessary to administer the federal land and to protect public health and safety), and the establishment of temporary roads on the Special Management Area. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior or of Agriculture (USDA), as appropriate (the Secretary), to allow the continuation of authorized activities, including heliskiing, within the Special Management Area. Designates the Special Management Area as the Sheep Mountain Wilderness on the date on which the Secretary publishes in the Federal Register a notice that the nonconforming use has terminated. (Sec. 5) Authorizes the continuation of the competitive running event permitted since 1992 in the vicinity of the boundaries of the Special Management Area, the Sheep Mountain Wilderness Area, and the Liberty Bell addition to the Mt. Sheffels Wilderness in a manner compatible with the preservation of those areas as wilderness. Prohibits anything in this Act from affecting: (1) the jurisdiction or responsibility of the state of Colorado respecting fish and wildlife; and (2) the creation of protective perimeters or buffer zones around the lands designated as wilderness or a special management area under this Act (covered land). Allows a nonwilderness activity or use conducted outside the boundary of the covered land notwithstanding the fact that such activity or use can be seen or heard from within covered land. Withdraws covered lands, as well as land within the Naturita Canyon Mineral Withdrawal Area, from: (1) entry, appropriation, or disposal under public land laws; (2) location, entry, and patent under mining laws; and (3) disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing or mineral materials. Authorizes the acquisition of non-federal land within the boundaries of the Special Management Area or the Wilderness only through exchange, donation, or purchase from a willing seller. Requires any land or interest acquired by the United States inside the boundaries of covered land to become part of the relevant wilderness or special management area. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire the parcel of state land identified as the McKenna Peak adjacent parcel on the map entitled \"McKenna Peak Wilderness\" and dated April 15, 2010, from the state by donation or exchange. Requires any portion of the State Trust land parcel identified on the map as the proposed Mckenna Peak Wilderness addition, which is acquired by the United States, to become part of the McKenna Peak Wilderness. Allows the continuation of grazing within the covered lands in which it was established, subject to specified regulations, policies, and practices. Prohibits inclusions in the NWPS or special area designations from being construed as interfering with: (1) the operation and maintenance of the Ames Hydroelectric Project; and (2) the authority of the Secretary to authorize mechanical thinning of trees or underbrush for the prevention or control of wildfires. Authorizes the use of wheeled, muscle-powered carts for the removal of shot game in the designated wilderness and special management areas. (Sec. 6) Sets forth provisions regarding water rights and access to, and the operation of, water resource facilities in lands designated as wilderness or a special management area."
