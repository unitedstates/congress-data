Provides that, if the Secretary receives an application from an individual whose status as a veteran cannot be verified, the Secretary may not include that small business in the database until the Secretary receives sufficient information to verify such status. Prohibits a small business from being listed in the database until the Secretary has verified that: (1) the small business is owned and controlled by veterans; and (2) when an owner indicates that the small business is owned and controlled by a veteran with a service-connected disability, the person is a veteran with a service-connected disability."
