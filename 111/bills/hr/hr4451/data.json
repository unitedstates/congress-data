Directs FERC to: (1) transfer the reinstated licenses to the town of Canton, Connecticut, if it reinstates them and extends the time period during which the licensee is required to commence project construction; and (2) complete an environmental assessment for the projects and update the environmental analysis performed during the licensing process. Sets a deadline for FERC to make a final decision on reinstatement of either or both projects. States that this Act neither affects any valid license issued by FERC under the Federal Power Act on or before the date of enactment of this Act nor diminishes or extinguishes any existing rights under any such license."
