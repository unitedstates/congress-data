Repeals the provision that an individual enrolled in an MA plan may during the first 45 days of a year (beginning with 2011): (1) change his or her plan election at any time, but only to elect to receive benefits under the original Medicare fee-for-service program under parts A and B of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act; and (2) elect qualified prescription drug coverage under part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program). Restores as if the repealed provision had never been enacted the previous provision which allowed an MA eligible individual continuous open enrollment and disenrollment during first three months of any year after 2006."
