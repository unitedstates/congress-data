Directs the Administrator to make grants to participating investment companies under the program and limits to $100 million the aggregate amount of all grants made to a participating investment company under the program. Requires, as a condition of receiving a grant under the program, all of the investments of participating investment companies to be in small businesses, and at least 50% to be in early-stage small businesses in the targeted industries. Directs the Administrator to monitory participant compliance with such requirements. Establishes a separate Treasury fund for such grants. Authorizes appropriations. Prohibits funds appropriated for such purpose from being used for a congressional earmark."
