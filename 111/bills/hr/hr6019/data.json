    "text": "Accountability and Transparency in Ethics Act of 2010 - Amends the federal criminal code to revise post-employment restrictions on former officers, employees, and elected officials of the executive and legislative branches. Increases from one to two years the ban on lobbying contacts by the following individuals with a Member, officer, or employee of the entity in which they served before his or her tenure terminated: (1) former senior and very senior personnel of the executive branch and independent agencies (except for special government employees who serve less that 60 days in the two-year period before termination); (2) former Members of the House of Representatives or elected officers; (3) former elected officers and employees of the Senate; (4) former personal staff of House Members; (5) former employees of House committees or congressional joint committees; (6) House leadership staff; and (7) employees of other legislative offices. Increases from one to two years the lobbying ban on former officers, employees, and elected officials of the executive and legislative branches for foreign entities. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit payment of campaign funds, except reimbursements under $500, to immediate family members of candidates. Requires the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to provide an ethics training course to registered lobbyists. Expresses the sense of Congress that any changes to the duties and responsibilities of the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) should strengthen, not undermine, its powers to further improve accountability and transparency in Congress. Grants subpoena power to the OCE board to carry out its duties."
