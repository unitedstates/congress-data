Requires the study to include the significance of Camp Hale in relation to national security during World War II and the Cold War, including: (1) the use of Camp Hale for training of the 10th Mountain Division and other elements of the U.S. Armed Forces; and (2) the use of Camp Hale for training by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of Tibetan refugees seeking to resist the Chinese occupation of Tibet. Expresses the intent of Congress that the Secretaries not propose any designation that would affect valid existing rights, including: (1) all existing interstate water compacts; (2) water rights decreed at, or flowing within, below, or through Camp Hale; (3) water rights in Colorado; (4) U.S. water rights; and (5) the management and operation of any reservoir. Requires the Secretary to submit the study and any recommendations related to Camp Hale to Congress. Authorizes appropriations."
