Defines an \"HIZ\" as a geographic region that contains clinical and other entities that provide a full spectrum of health care to such patients and a teaching hospital that has the capacity to conduct health services research and provide clinical training for health professionals. Requires the HIZ program to: (1) incorporate innovative clinical initiatives for training health professionals in a new model of cost-effective, high-quality health care; and (2) consist of an HIZ planning grant program and an HIZ pilot project. Directs the Secretary to make up to 25 HIZ planning grants to eligible health care entities for researching and preparing HIZ design plans, which shall describe the HIZ Coordinating Entity (who will receive and administer payments under the program), how care will be provided, how spending will be reduced, how providers will be integrated and delivery processes changed to reduce costs and improve care, the target population,quality improvement metrics, training, data collection mechanisms, methods for monitoring health costs and use, a strategy to improve prevention, mechanisms to achieve community involvement, payment methodology options, and startup and operating costs. Directs the Secretary to establish an HIZ pilot project to test the effectiveness of HIZs in reducing the rate of growth of health care costs while improving quality of care."
