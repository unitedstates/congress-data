Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to require appropriate states to: (1) submit to the Secretary reports identifying SNAP participation in the 25 largest U.S. cities; and (2) implement practices to increase program participation in cities where eligible household participation is less than 85%. Increases funding for grants to increase program participation. Directs the Secretary to carry out a program to support the use of electronic benefits transfers for federal nutrition programs at farmers' markets."
