Grants each component's privacy official primary responsibility for implementing the privacy policy for DHS established by DHS's privacy officer. Requires each designated privacy official to report directly to both the component head and DHS's privacy officer. Lists the responsibilities of each component privacy official, including: (1) serving as DHS's privacy officer's main point of contact at the component to implement that officer's policies and directives; (2) advising the component head on privacy considerations when any law, regulation, or guideline is proposed, developed, or implemented; (3) assuring that the use of technologies sustains or enhances privacy protections; (4) identifying privacy issues related to component programs; (5) monitoring the component's compliance with all applicable federal privacy laws and regulations; (6) assisting in drafting and reviewing privacy impact assessments, privacy threshold assessments, and system of records notices; (7) implementing and monitoring privacy training for component employees and contractors in coordination with DHS's privacy officer; and (8) providing DHS's privacy officer with written materials and information regarding the relevant activities of the component, including privacy violations and abuse, that are needed to successfully prepare reports for Congress and on behalf of DHS. Directs each component head to ensure that the component's privacy official: (1) has the information, resources, and access to material and personnel necessary to fulfill his or her responsibilities; (2) is advised of proposed policy changes and the development of new programs, regulations, procedures, or guidelines during the planning stages; and (3) is included in decisionmaking."
