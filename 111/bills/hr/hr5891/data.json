Defines: (1) \"partial benefits poverty income measure\" to mean money income as defined by the Bureau for purposes of any survey relating to income or poverty in the United States; and (2) \"full benefits poverty income measure\" to mean the sum of the partial benefits poverty income measure and other non-cash benefits (including supplemental nutrition assistance benefits, housing subsidies, the actuarial value of health insurance coverage, and any other state or federal means-tested benefits) attributable to the members of the household involved, including non-related members, as calculated by the Bureau by applying its current disposable income methodology. Requires the Bureau to produce corresponding tables and graphs showing for each year the poverty rates (and related data) determined by using each such measure."
