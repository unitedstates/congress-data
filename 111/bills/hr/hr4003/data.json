Instructs the Secretary, in conducting the study, to: (1) determine the effect of designation of the study area as a unit of the System on specified existing commercial and recreational activities and the effect on the authority of state and local governments to manage these activities; (2) identify any authorities that will compel or permit the Secretary to influence local land use decisions or place restrictions on non-federal land if the study area is designated as a System unit; and (3) closely examine park unit models that encompass large areas of non-federal lands within their designated boundaries, foster public and private collaborative arrangements for achieving NPS objectives, and protect and respect private landowners' rights. Requires the Secretary to submit a report to Congress on the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of such study."
