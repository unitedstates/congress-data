    "text": "National Climate Service Act of 2009 - Requires the Secretary of Commerce to establish within the Climate Program Office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) a National Climate Service that includes a national center and a network of regional and local facilities for operational climate observation, modeling, and research. Requires the Service to: (1) inform the public about climate impacts; (2) serve as a clearinghouse and technical access point to stakeholders for information on climate, climate impacts, and adaptation, and relevant comprehensive databases of information; (3) provide education on climate impacts, vulnerabilities, and application of climate information in decisionmaking; (4) design decision-support tools that facilitate use of climate information in stakeholders' near-term operations and long-term planning; (5) facilitate user access to climate experts for technical assistance in the use of climate information and to inform the climate forecast community of their information needs; (6) provide researcher, modeler, and observations experts access to users to help guide direction of their activities; and (7) propose and evaluate adaptation strategies for climate variability and change. Sets forth the Service's functions, including establishing an atmospheric monitoring and verification program utilizing aircraft, satellite, ground sensors, ocean and coastal observing systems, and modeling capabilities to monitor, measure, and verify greenhouse gas concentrations and emissions throughout the oceans and atmosphere. Requires the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees on a plan of action for the Service. Requires the Administrator of NOAA to appoint a Director of the Service. Requires the Director to appoint members of a National Climate Service Advisory Council to promote coordination across regional, national, and international concerns and assess information needs."
