    "text": "Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to study and report to Congress on the feasibility of establishing a national program for measuring, reporting, publicly disclosing, and labeling products or materials sold in the United States for their carbon content, including regarding: (1) whether such a program would be effective in achieving greenhouse gas reductions; (2) criteria for identifying and prioritizing sectors, products, and processes that should be covered; (3) an identification of products, processes, or sectors whose inclusion could have a substantial carbon impact; (4) suggested methodology and protocols for measuring the carbon content of products across their entire carbon lifecycle; (5) options for educating consumers about product carbon content and the program; (6) an analysis of the associated costs and timelines; and (7) an evaluation of incentives to determine whether reductions in emissions can be accelerated through encouraging more efficient manufacturing or by encouraging preferences for lower-emissions products over higher-emissions products whose level of performance is no better. Requires the Administrator, upon concluding the study, to establish a national product carbon disclosure program, participation in which shall be voluntary and which may involve a product carbon label with broad applicability to the wholesale and consumer markets to enable and encourage knowledge about carbon content by producers and consumers and to inform efforts to reduce energy consumption nationwide."
