Requires (current law authorizes) the Administrator to make grants to such companies to be used for loans to new-market small businesses, and to guarantee debentures issued by such companies. Establishes the Office of New Markets Venture Capital, headed by a Director, to administer the Program. Revises the definition of \"low income geographic area\" for Program eligibility purposes. Requires a study by the SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy on the availability of equity capital in low-income urban and rural areas. Authorizes operational assistance grants to conditionally approved companies."
