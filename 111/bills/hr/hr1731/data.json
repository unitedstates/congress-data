    "text": "Credit Risk Retention Act of 2009 - Amends the Truth in Lending Act to require the federal banking agencies to prescribe specified regulations jointly to require any creditor that makes a residential mortgage loan that is not a qualified mortgage (as defined by such agencies) to retain an economic interest in a material portion of the credit risk for any such loan that the creditor transfers, sells, or conveys to a third party. Requires the standards governing such regulations to: (1) apply only to residential mortgage loans that are not qualified mortgages; (2) prohibit creditors from directly or indirectly hedging or otherwise transferring the credit risk they are required to retain under the regulations with respect to any residential mortgage loan; and (3) requiring creditors to retain at least 5% percent of the credit risk on any non-qualified mortgage that is transferred, sold, or conveyed."
