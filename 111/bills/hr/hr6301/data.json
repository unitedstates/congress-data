    "text": "Prevention of Unreasonable Fees Act - Prohibits an operator of a transportation terminal that uses federal funds for terminal construction, or for the purchase or lease of equipment installed there, from charging a fee to a provider of pre-arranged ground transportation service that meets state vehicle and intrastate passenger licensing requirements. Exempts from such prohibition: (1) fees charged to the general public for access to, or use of, the terminal; (2) any fee for the availability of ancillary facilities located there; or (3) any fee for such access or use that the Secretary has approved in advance as reasonable, nonburdensome, nondiscriminatory, and necessary to the provision of prearranged ground transportation service. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to: (1) prohibit or restrict a transportation terminal operator from requiring vehicles that cannot safely use public parking facilities to use segregated facilities provided the fee for segregated facilities is no more than that charged to the public for similar facilities; or (2) restrict the right of a state or its political subdivisions to require a license or fee (other than a prohibited transportation terminal fee) for a motor vehicle providing certain other prearranged ground transportation."
