    "text": "Procedures for Sanctions Against Charities Act - Amends the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to allow a sanction to be imposed that blocks the property of a charity only pursuant to a warrant obtained in the same manner as provided for a search warrant under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Permits a court to issue such warrant if the United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that: (1) the property with respect to which the warrant is sought is subject to the sanction; and (2) the property may be moved outside the jurisdiction of the United States. Permits imposing a sanction prior to applying to the court for a warrant if there is reason to believe that delay may have an adverse result, including: (1) endangering the life or physical safety of an individual; (2) flight from prosecution; (3) destruction of or tampering with evidence; (4) intimidation of potential witnesses; or (5) otherwise seriously jeopardizing an investigation. Directs the President to establish specified procedures with respect to the imposition of a sanction that blocks the property of a charity. Sets forth appeal procedures for affected charities."
