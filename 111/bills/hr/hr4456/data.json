    "text": "BPA-Free Kids Act of 2009 - Defines \"children's food or beverage container\" as any container, except a metal can, that is: (1) designed or intended to be filled with any liquid, food, or beverage primarily for consumption from that container by children three years old or younger; and (2) sold or distributed at retail without containing any liquid, food, or beverage. Requires that any children's food or beverage container that is composed in whole or in part of bisphenol A (BPA) be treated as a banned hazardous substance under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. Grants the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) jurisdiction over, and authority to enforce, the provisions of this Act, notwithstanding: (1) specified provisions of various Acts; and (2) a specified memorandum of understanding between the CPSC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Requires suppliers and manufacturers to test for BPA plastic resins used in the manufacture and distribution of children's food and beverage containers to ensure that the plastic resins in children's food and beverage containers do not contain BPA. Requires suppliers to certify to manufacturers that plastic resins do not contain BPA. Imposes labeling and advertising requirements. Allows nonconflicting state and subdivision laws. Requires research to increase understanding of the health effects of BPA exposure in all age groups and in pregnant women."
