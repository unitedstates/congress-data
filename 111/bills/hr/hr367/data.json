Requires the National Ocean Research Leadership Council to serve as the System's policy and coordination oversight body. Requires the Council to establish or designate an Interagency Ocean Observation Committee to prepare annual and long-term plans and to take other actions. Makes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) the System's lead federal agency. Sets forth the requirements for a regional information coordination entity to be certified or established. Requires the Administrator to establish or designate a System Advisory Committee. Requires the Council to develop a policy that defines processes for making decisions about the roles of the federal government, states, regional information coordination entities, the academic community, and the private sector in providing to end-user communities environmental information, products, technologies, and services related to the System."
