    "text": "Enhancing Quality through Survey System Improvements Act of 2010 - Amends titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to revise requirements for the review by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) of state procedures for scheduling and conducing standard skilled nursing facility (SNF) surveys. Authorizes the Secretary to review the SNF survey procedures of contractors other than a state. Makes each top tier SNF and nursing facility subject to a complete on-site standard survey at specified three-year intervals. Requires each state to implement programs to measure and reduce inconsistency in the application of survey results (including the results of both health surveys and life safety surveys) among surveyors. Lists the circumstances for special compliance surveys. Requires any funds collected by a state as an administrative civil monetary penalty to be used for the development of acuity adjusters that will provide more accurate information to the public, SNFs, nursing facilities, and their residents about the quality of care provided by each such facility."
