Requires transmittal to the Commissioner of CBP of supplemental passenger and crew manifests in instances when a passenger acquires a flight ticket or a flight crewmember is assigned to a flight after transmittal of the original manifest. Allows late ticket purchases or crewmember assignments within two hours before depature of a flight only if the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) issues procedures permitting such ticketing and assignments. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to require those air carriers that transmit a passenger and crew manifest to conduct a final comparison of passenger information on the manifest to the no fly list of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) within 60 minutes of a flight's departure."
