Authorizes the President to extend Corps activities to state- and private- owned lands to prevent and control forest fires and floods and attacks of forest tree pests and diseases. Requires the President, based on certain criteria, to give preference to the employment of additional persons in the Corps in the following order: (1) unemployed Armed Forces veterans (including Reserve members); (2) unemployed U.S. citizens who have exhausted their unemployment compensation; (3) unemployed U.S. citizens who are eligible for unemployment compensation immediately before employment in the Corps, including any additional compensation or extended compensation; and (4) other unemployed or underemployed U.S. citizens. Authorizes the President to provide housing and transportation for Corps employees. Prohibits discrimination in the hiring of Corps employees."
