Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) for the provision of financial literacy training and assistance to parents and students. Encourages LEA grantees to partner with community organizations, financial institutions, or local businesses when implementing such program. Directs the Secretary and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to coordinate the activities funded under this Act with the activities carried out by any financial education research center operated by a Federal Reserve bank."
