Provides that no bill, joint resolution, amendment, or conference report containing a provision which would have the effect of limiting the application of provisions regarding the confidentiality of census information shall be considered as passed or agreed to by either chamber of Congress except by a vote of at least two-thirds of the Members voting. Requires: (1) the Secretary of Commerce to submit to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) a copy of each question proposed to be included in the 2010 census and the American Community Survey; (2) GAO\u00a0 to review and report to Congress on such questions; and (3) the Secretary to include his or her views on, and GAO to specifically address, the reasons for each question, the purposes for which the information obtained is likely to be used, alternative means by which the same information could be obtained, and the relative advantages and disadvantages of obtaining the information through a census or survey. Prohibits any person conducting the Survey or 2010 census from seeking answers to any questions relating to a household or any member of such household from any person who is not a member of that household."
