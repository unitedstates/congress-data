(Sec. 226) Prohibits the Secretary, with respect to the use of funds for the operation, capital improvement, and management of public housing authorized by the United States Housing Act of 1937, from imposing any asset management requirement or guideline that restricts or limits in any way the use of capital funds for central office costs.

(Sec. 234) Revises requirements for prepayment of a loan providing HUD assistance for supportive housing for the elderly under the Housing Act of 1959 (as in effect before the enactment of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act). Allows prepayment of such a loan to involve refinancing if it results in: (1) a lower interest rate on the project's loan principal and in reductions in debt service related to such loan; or (2) in the case of certain HUD assisted projects providing supportive housing for the elderly, a transaction in which the project owner will address the physical needs of the project.
