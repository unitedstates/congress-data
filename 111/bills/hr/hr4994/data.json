(Sec. 102) Amends the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, as modified by other federal law, to extend section 508 hospital reclassifications through FY2011. (\"Section 508\" refers to Section 508 of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 [MMA], which allows the temporary reclassification of a hospital with a low Medicare area wage index, for reimbursement purposes, to a nearby location with a higher Medicare area wage index, so that the \"Section 508 hospital\" will receive the higher Medicare reimbursement rate.) (Sec. 103) Extends through calendar 2011 the 1.0 floor on geographic indexing adjustments to the work portion of the physician fee schedule. (Sec. 104) Extends through December 31, 2011, the process allowing exceptions to limitations on medically necessary therapy caps. (Sec. 105) Amends the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 to extend until January 1, 2012, an exception to a payment rule that permits laboratories to receive direct Medicare reimbursement when providing the technical component of certain physician pathology services that had been outsourced by certain (rural) hospitals. (Sec. 106) Amends SSA title XVIII to extend the bonus and increased payments for ground ambulance services until January 1, 2012. Amends the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) to extend the payment of certain urban air ambulance services until January 1, 2012. Extends increased payments for super rural ambulance services until January 1, 2012. (Sec. 107) Amends MIPPA to extend the physician fee schedule mental health add-on payment provision through December 31, 2011. (Sec. 108) Extends through 2011 hold harmless provisions under the prospective payment system for hospital outpatient department services. (Sec. 109) Amends the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, as modified by other federal law, to extend from July 1, 2010, until July 1, 2012, the reasonable cost reimbursement for clinical diagnostic laboratory service for qualifying rural hospitals with under 50 beds. (Sec. 110) Amends SSA title XIX (Medicaid) to extend the Qualifying Individual (Q1) Program through December 31, 2011, at specified allocations. (Sec. 111) Extends the Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA) Program through December 31, 2011. (Sec. 112) Amends the Public Health Service Act to extend through FY2013 the authorization of appropriations for: (1) type I diabetes research; and (2) diabetes prevention and treatment through Indian health facilities.
