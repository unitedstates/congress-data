Requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), in implementing those lead limits with regard to a small business, a person who sells used goods, or a charity to: (1) work cooperatively with the entity; (2) take into account economic, administrative, or other limits on the entity's compliance ability; and (3) construe those provisions favorably to the entity. Exempts a children's product made solely out of fabric from provisions requiring a manufacturer to certify, based on third party testing, that the product complies with an applicable children's product safety rule before importing, warehousing, or distributing the product."
