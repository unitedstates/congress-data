Authorizes the Secretary of State to waive such ban if in the U.S. national interest. Prohibits the head of an executive agency from entering into or renewing a contract for the procurement of goods or services with a person or entity that provides censorship or surveillance technology to the government of Iran. Authorizes the Secretary concerned to waive such prohibition if in the U.S. national interest. States that the establishment and carrying out of operations by U.S. nonprofit organizations in Iran for the direct provision of specified humanitarian and people-to-people assistance may not be prohibited or restricted. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to require such an organization to notify the Department of the Treasury up to 14 days in advance of commencing operations in Iran. Excludes from such provision an organization that provides services or conducts transactions with any organization or entity that appears on the Department of the Treasury's Specially Designated Nationals List (a list of organizations and individuals that are restricted from doing business with the United States or U.S companies or individuals)."
