    "text": "Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) Reform Act of 2009 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to rename the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) the Medicare Payment and Access Commission, make it an independent executive branch (instead of a legislative branch) agency, and revise its membership requirements. Directs MedPAC to determine payment rates for items and services furnished under Medicare. Requires the Comptroller General to study and report annually to Congress on changes to payment policies under the Medicare program as a result of the amendments made by this Act. Makes it in order in the Senate or the House to consider any measure that would overrule a MedPAC determination with respect to such payments if three-fifths of the Members agree to such consideration. Authorizes MedPAC to advise the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), on priorities for health services research. Directs MedPAC to establish: (1) an office of ombudsman to handle complaints on the implementation of certain regulations; and (2) a council of health and economic advisers to advise it on its development, analyses, and implementation of payment policies. Establishes: (1) a consumer advisory council to advise MedPAC on the impact of Medicare payment policies on consumers; and (2) a federal health advisory council."
