Requires the assignment within each military department of at least one full-time Sexual Assault Response Coordinator and one full-time Sexual Assault Victim Advocate, allowing the Secretary of the military department concerned to assign additional coordinators and/or advocates based on the demographics or needs of the unit. Allows only members of the Armed Forces (members) or DOD civilian personnel to be assigned as coordinators or advocates. Directs the Secretary of Defense to establish a professional training and certification program for such coordinators and advocates, and requires performance evaluations of all coordinators and advocates. Entitles any member, or dependent of a member, who is the victim of a sexual assault to legal assistance provided by a military legal assistance counsel and Victim Advocate service, regardless of whether the member or dependent elects unrestricted or restricted (confidential) reporting of the assault. Makes privileged any communications between a member or dependent and a Victim Advocate. Directs the Secretary to provide for the inclusion of a sexual assault prevention and response training module at each level of professional military education."
