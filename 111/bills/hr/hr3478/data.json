Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from gross income payments made to an Advantage HSA and premium payments for a high deductible health plan under an Advantage HSA. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a program for payment by debit card of HSA medical expenses. Establishes the HSA Healthcare Panel to review information relating to treatments, services, and products treatable as medical expenses under an HSA. Requires health care providers to disclose to patients the actual price to be charged for services or treatment and different payment rates applicable to other health care entities. Prohibits the issuance or renewal of an immigrant visa to an alien unless such alien presents evidence of coverage under a high deductible health plan and an HSA. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to impose criminal penalties on an alien who reenters the United States after receiving emergency medical assistance prior to removal."
