Sets forth area eligibility requirements, including: (1) being in extreme nonattainment of the 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard and in nonattainment of the national ambient air quality standard for PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter that does not exceed 2.5 micrometers) promulgated by the Administrator under the Clean Air Act; (2) having specified emission levels of oxides of nitrogen from farm equipment or of volatile organic compounds from farming operations; (3) meeting or exceeding national averages for asthma; (4) exceeding national averages for unemployment; and (5) being eligible for state or local matching funds. Prohibits an area from being designated unless the relevant district provides satisfactory assurances that the strategic plan (to be contained in its application) will be implemented. Authorizes the Administrator to revoke the designation if the relevant district: (1) has been designated as being in attainment with the air quality standards; or (2) is failing to comply with, or make progress in achieving the goals of, its strategic plan."
