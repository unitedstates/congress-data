Considers such bust a gift to the United States. Limits such bust to one per state on display. Requires the House Committee on House Administration to specify standards which must be met by such state provided bust, including that: (1) it must portray a leading political, religious, or cultural figure from the state's history; (2) it must conform to roughly uniform dimensions; (3) its construction must be in either bronze or marble; (4) its style must be realistic; and (5) no bust representing any individual may be accepted for display as part of the program until 50 years after his or her death."
