(Sec. 503) Directs the Secretary to submit to the appropriate committees a report containing: (1) a strategic plan for the global nuclear detection architecture to deter and detect the transport of nuclear or radioactive materials by all means possible, with specific focus on establishing the goals, objectives, and cost projections for the next five years; and (2) an analysis of overall budget allocations that determines whether government-wide nuclear detection resources clearly align with identified priorities to maximize results and minimize duplication of efforts. (Sec. 504) Expresses the sense of Congress that the Director must attempt to identify viable alternatives to the use of advanced spectroscopic portal monitors for primary screening and report to Congress. (Sec. 505) Authorizes appropriations to the Director for the Securing the Cities Initiative for FY2011-FY2012. Title VI: Clarifying Amendments - (Sec. 601) Authorizes a federally funded research development center to perform independent analysis of homeland security issues and reports its findings to the appropriate committees and the Secretary, at the request of the chairman and ranking minority member of an appropriate congressional committee. Encourages such centers, upon such a request, to provide to the committee a copy of any report it produces for DHS or any of its components. Directs: (1) the Secretary to review and revise DHS policies relating to personnel conflicts of interest to ensure that such policies specifically address employees of federally funded research and development centers who are in a position to make or materially influence research findings or agency decisionmaking; and (2) each such center to transmit to the Secretary and appropriate congressional committees an annual report on the center's activities. (Sec. 602) Repeals provisions regarding the establishment of a Homeland Security Institute. (Sec. 603) Directs the Comptroller of the United States to: (1) conduct a study to assess the implementation of the statutory relationship between DHS and the Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories, as established under HSA; and (2) submit recommendations to the appropriate committees for improvements to that relationship. (Sec. 604) Amends HSA to repeal a provision that includes within the mission of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office to conduct a transformational research and development program to generate and improve technologies to detect and prevent the illicit entry or potential use within the United States of a nuclear explosive device or fissile or radiological material and to coordinate with the Under Secretary for Science and Technology on research and development efforts relevant to the mission of both organizations. Title VII: Commission on the Protection of Critical Electric and Electronic Infrastructures - (Sec. 701) Establishes the Commission on the Protection of Critical Electric and Electronic Infrastructures to: (1) assess vulnerabilities of electric and electronic infrastructures; (2) provide a clear and comprehensive strategy and specific recommendations for protecting such infrastructures; and (3) test, evaluate, and report on specific mitigation protection and recovery devices or methods. Directs the Commission to give particular attention to threats that can disrupt or damage critical electric and electronic infrastructures. Requires the Commission to address: (1) the quantification of specified threats (i.e., cyber attacks or unintentional cyber disruption, electromagnetic phenomena such as geomagnetically induced currents, intentional electromagnetic interference, and electromagnetic pulses caused by nuclear weapons, and other physical attacks, acts of nature, or accidents) to the U.S. electric and electronic infrastructure; (2) the roles, missions, and structure of all relevant federal, state, and local government agencies with responsibilities for ensuring protection and reliability for electric and electronic infrastructures; (3) the roles, missions, and structure of all relevant private sector entities with responsibilities for ensuring protection and reliability for such infrastructures; (4) interagency coordination between and among those government and private sector entities; and (5) recommendations for protections and recovery devices and measures.
