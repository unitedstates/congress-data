Bars the establishment of the Park until it is determined that specified conditions have been met, including that: (1) Connecticut, the city of Hartford, or private property owner, as appropriate, has entered into a written agreement with the Secretary of the Interior to donate at least 10,000 square feet of space in the East Armory; and (2) the Secretary has entered into a written agreement with the state, city, or other public entity, as appropriate, which provides that land owned by such an entity within the Coltsville Historic District shall be managed consistent with land uses that are compatible with the designation of the Park and the city's preservation ordinance. Requires the Park to provide interpretation and viewing of specified sites, including the East Armory and Colt Park. Requires the Secretary to enter into a written agreement with the Connecticut State Library, Wadsworth Atheneum, and the Colt Trust, or other public entities, as appropriate, to gain access to Colt-related artifacts to have them on display in the East Armory or within the Park. (Sec. 4) Prohibits anything in this Act from enlarging, diminishing, or modifying any authority of the state or any of its political subdivisions. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with the owners of any properties within the Historic District or any nationally significant properties within the Park under which the Secretary may identify, interpret, restore and provide technical assistance for the preservation of such properties. Bars the making of any changes or alterations to any properties covered by such an agreement unless the Secretary and the other party to the agreement agree to the changes or alterations. Requires any payment made by the Secretary under this section to be subject to an agreement that the conversion, use, or disposal of a project for purposes contrary to the purposes of this section shall entitle the United States to reimbursement. Requires any federal funds under such an agreement to be matched on a one-to-one basis by non-federal funds. Permits the acquisition of lands or interests owned by the state or any political subdivision of the state by donation only. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance and public interpretation of related historic and cultural resources within the Historic District. (Sec. 5) Requires the Secretary to complete and submit to Congress a management plan for the Park with the advice of the Coltsville National Historical Park Advisory Commission established by this Act. Requires the management plan to include provisions that identify the costs to be shared by the federal government, the state, and the city, and other public or private entities or individuals for necessary capital improvements to and maintenance and operations of the Park. (Sec. 6) Directs the Commission to advise the Secretary in the implementation of the management plan. Terminates the Commission 10 years after enactment of this Act. Allows the Commission to be extended for an additional 10-year period, if necessary. (Sec. 7) Authorizes appropriations for the development of the Park."
