Defines \"depiction of extreme animal cruelty\" as any visual depiction of actual conduct in which one or more animals is tortured, maimed, mutilated, or subjected to other acts of extreme animal cruelty, that appeals to the prurient interest, and that, taken as a whole, does not have more than de minimis religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value."
