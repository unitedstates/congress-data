Phases in the deduction by allowing the deduction of 50 percent of the cost of premiums in 2011, 75 percent in 2012, and 100 percent in 2013 or thereafter. Allows long-term care insurance as a benefit under tax-qualified cafeteria plans and flexible spending arrangements. Allows a tax credit for caregivers of individuals with long-term health care needs. Phases in a $3,000 credit amount for 2015 or thereafter, beginning with $1,000 in 2011, $1,500 in 2012, $2,000 in 2013, and $2,500 in 2014. Reduces the amount of the credit for taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes over $75,000 ($150,000 for joint returns), adjusted for inflation after 2011."
