Requires the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to: (1) conduct, upon the request of the Attorney General or a background check designee, a nationwide criminal history background check; (2) provide criminal history records; and (3) investigate and resolve challenges to the accuracy and completeness of criminal history records. Authorizes appropriations for FY2011-FY2014. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that fees collected by the Attorney General or the background check designee should be sufficient to carry out their duties under this Act and to help support the criminal history review program. Limits the liability of entities participating in the background check system established by this Act resulting from a failure to conduct criminal background checks or to take adverse action against a covered individual after receiving a criminal history report. Imposes restrictions on the disclosure of fingerprints, criminal history records, or information in such records. Requires the Attorney General to promulgate regulations to enforce such disclosure restrictions and to destroy fingerprints and criminal history records after any transaction based upon such fingerprints or records is completed. Amends the PROTECT Act to provide for an extension of the Child Safety Pilot Program."
