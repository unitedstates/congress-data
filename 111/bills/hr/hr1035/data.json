Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental and Native American Public Policy Act of 1992 to rename the Act as the Morris K. Udall and Stewart L. Udall Foundation Act. (Sec. 3) Adds to the Act's findings to salute Stewart L. Udall's leadership in environmental and Native American policy as a member of Congress, Secretary of the Interior, environmental lawyer, and author. (Sec. 5) Renames the Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental Policy Foundation as the Morris K. Udall and Stewart L. Udall Foundation. Requires the Executive Director of the Foundation to be paid at a senior executive rate. (Sec. 6) Directs the Foundation to award grants to the Udall Center for Studies in Public Policy, at the University of Arizona, to conduct training, research, and other activities with regard to the involvement of Native American and Alaska Native professionals in health care and public policy. Refers to recipients of scholarships, fellowships, and internships under the Act as Udall Scholars, Udall Fellows, and Udall Interns, respectively. (Currently, they are known as Morris K. Udall Scholars.) (Sec. 7) Renames the Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental Policy Trust Fund, the Morris K. Udall and Stewart L. Udall Trust Fund. Allows the use of reasonable amounts of the Trust Fund for official reception and representation expenses, not to exceed $5,000 for a fiscal year. (Sec. 9) Declares that the use of the Foundation or the United States Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution for independent and impartial assessment, mediation, or other related services in connection with a dispute or conflict related to the environment, public lands, or natural resources shall not be considered the establishment or use of an advisory committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. (Sec. 10) Sets forth administrative provisions that allow the Foundation to: (1) appoint personnel without regard to federal law provisions governing appointments in the competitive service; (2) pay up to four employees, in addition to the Executive Director, at senior executive pay rates; and (3) rent office space in the District of Columbia or its environs."
