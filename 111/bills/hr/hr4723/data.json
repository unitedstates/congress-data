Prohibits the Secretary from promulgating any interim rule under specified provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act that prohibits fishing in the Gulf of Mexico red snapper fishery before such report demonstrates the need for interim or final rules. Deems any interim rule promulgated prior to enactment of this Act that decreases the number of fishing days to less than the 2009 level to have no force or effect."
