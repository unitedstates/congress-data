Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to make minor adjustments to the boundaries of the Monument for the inclusion of significant archaeological resources discovered on adjacent public land. Requires management of, and authorizes use of, the Monument as a unit of San Juan National Forest. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out vegetative management treatments within the Monument, with the exception of timber harvesting and the use of prescribed fire, which may only be used when necessary to address the risk of wildfire, insects, or diseases. Prohibits uses of the Monument other than those authorized by the Secretary. Includes as authorized uses: (1) construction of a visitor's center and related exhibit and curatorial facilities to interpret the Monument's scientific and cultural resources; (2) scientific research (including archaeological research) and educational and interpretive uses; (3) acquisition and display of artifacts; (4) recreational use of mountain bikes and motorized vehicles; (5) installation and maintenance of a certain public utility right of way; and (6) grazing uses. Requires the Secretary to develop a management plan for the Monument, which shall include: (1) providing for the continued use of the Monument by Indian tribes for traditional ceremonies and as a source for traditional plants and other materials; and (2) specifying permitted uses of artifacts."
