Allows states to use grants to conduct inspections, train inspection personnel, contract with a commercial applicator to inspect and treat lodging facilities, and educate lodging proprietors and staff about prevention and eradication of bed bugs. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the effectiveness of the grant program. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to include bed bug prevention and management in public housing agency plans. Amends the Public Health Service Act to include bed bug prevention and control under the block grant program for preventive health services. Requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to investigate the public health implications of bed bugs on lodging and housing and report to Congress."
