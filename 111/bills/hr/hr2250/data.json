    "text": "Energy Independence Now Act of 2009 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to: (1) authorize tax-exempt bond financing for domestic use oil refinery facilities; (2) set forth an ASME Nuclear Certification credit; (3) modify the credit against tax for specified energy production, including certain vehicles acquired from domestic corporations; and (4) eliminate certain restrictions on the use of energy alternatives. Directs the President to designate federal lands and closed military installations for private sector development of oil or natural gas refineries. Requires lands which have not been used as a refinery within 10 years after such designation to be made available for leasing for renewable energy development, including ethanol refineries. Prohibits the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) from denying an application for a facility on the grounds of insufficient disposal capacity for spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste. Declares without force or effect federal prohibitions against spending appropriated funds for oil and natural gas leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). American-Made Energy and Good Jobs Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to launch an oil and gas leasing program on the Coastal Plain of Alaska (including a limited payment of federal revenues to the state of Alaska). Coal-to-Liquid Fuel Promotion Act of 2009 - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to: (1) authorize appropriations for the coal-to-liquid fuel loan guarantee program; and (2) promote coal-to-liquid manufacturing on federal land. Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) to direct the Secretaries of Energy and of Defense to study and report to Congress on maintaining coal-to-liquid products in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). Authorizes: (1) construction of storage facilities near pipeline infrastructure; (2) contracts with private sector companies for coal-to-liquid facilities on or near military installations; and (3) appropriations for the Air Force Research Laboratory to procure coal-derived synthetic fuels for aviation jet use. Requires the Secretary of Energy to: (1) evaluate Fischer-Tropsch fuel in connection with certain transportation fuels; and (2) report to Congress on the public health effects of using Fischer-Tropsch fuel for transportation purposes. Amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to lease public lands for production of renewable biomass for biofuels."
