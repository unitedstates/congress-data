    "text": "Pine River Indian Irrigation Project Act of 2009 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to study the irrigation infrastructure of the Pine River Indian Irrigation Project, Colorado, and develop a list of activities that are recommended to be implemented over a 10-year period to repair, rehabilitate, or reconstruct that infrastructure. Requires the Secretary to prioritize activities based on: (1) a review of specified priority factors (i.e., threats to health and safety; the extent of disrepair and its effect on the ability of Project users to irrigate agricultural land; the extent to which infrastructure repair would provide an opportunity to conserve water; the economic and cultural impacts the disrepair has, and benefits the repair would have, on the Tribe; the opportunity to address water supply or environmental conflicts through repair; and overall benefits of the activity to efficient water operations on the land of the Tribe); (2) recommendations of the Tribe; and (3) a consideration of projected benefits on Project completion. Authorizes the Secretary to provide grants to, and enter into cooperative agreements with, the Tribe to repair, rehabilitate, reconstruct, or replace the Project's irrigation infrastructure. Prohibits such assistance from being used for on-farm improvements. Requires the Secretary, in providing assistance, to coordinate the activity with any work being conducted under the irrigation operations and maintenance program of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Caps the federal share of the total cost at 75%, subject to a waiver or limitation on the nonfederal share, at the Tribe's request."
