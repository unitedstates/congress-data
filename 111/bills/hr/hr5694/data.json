Requires the Task Force to implement strategies in response to foreign government policies that unjustifiably or unreasonably burden or restrict international trade in Internet-related goods, services, and content, mandate or otherwise preference Internet-related technology standards and related measures, impede the free flow of information on the Internet, or otherwise threaten U.S. interests in Internet-related international trade and the open, global nature of the Internet. Requires the Task Force to transmit to Congress specified annual reports and action plans and to hold a public hearing in the preparation of each report and plan. Instructs the U.S. Trade Representative to initiate an investigation of any acts, policies, or practices of a foreign government that are identified in such reports and plans as priority concerns in accordance with specified provisions of the Trade Act of 1974. Directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Attorney General to investigate whether each act, policy, or practice identified in such a report or plan (or any related action by a nongovernmental entity) violates any antitrust laws. Requires the Task Force to report to Congress on the sufficiency of existing multilateral and bilateral trade agreements in advancing specified objectives that support the goal of a single open, global Internet. Instructs the Task Force to organize specified standards related training."
