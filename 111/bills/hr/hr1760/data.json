Requires the Administrator, within a year, to finalize regulations under the Clean Air Act to reduce emissions of black carbon or propose a finding that existing regulations promulgated pursuant to such Act adequately regulate them. Requires the Administrator to report to Congress on the amount, type, and direction of all present U.S. financial, technical, and related assistance to foreign countries to reduce, mitigate, and abate black carbon emissions."
