Authorizes such projects to include: (1) delivering or enhancing outpatient home-based health and support services; and (2) providing education to new mothers and their families about postpartum conditions to promote earlier diagnosis and treatment. Sets forth grant requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance to entities seeking a grant. Title III: General Provisions - (Sec. 301) Authorizes appropriations for FY2010-FY2012. (Sec. 302) Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on the benefits of screening for postpartum conditions.
