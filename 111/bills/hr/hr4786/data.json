Ratifies and approves all actions taken by federal employees, contractors, and grantees during that period of lapse to: (1) maintain the essential level of government operations, services, and activities to protect life and property; and (2) bring about orderly termination of government functions. Requires that funds used by the Secretary of Transportation to compensate such employees be derived from funds previously authorized out of the Highway Trust Fund and made available or limited to the Department of Transportation by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010. Deems this Act to be a section of the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2010, as in effect on the date of the enactment of the last amendment to such Resolution."
