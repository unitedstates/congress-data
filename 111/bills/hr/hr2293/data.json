Requires the United States Trade Representative (USTR) and the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, Health and Human Services (HHS), Labor, Defense, or other executive departments to seek written advisory opinions from the advisory committees established under such Act throughout the trade agreement negotiation process.
