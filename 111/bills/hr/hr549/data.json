Directs the Office to: (1) serve as the lead agency of DHS for ensuring that programs designed to counter terrorist explosive attacks function together efficiently to meet the evolving threat from explosives and improvised explosive devices (IEDs); (2) promote secure information sharing of sensitive material and security awareness; (3) assist state, local, and tribal governments in developing multijurisdictional IED security plans for high risk jurisdictions; and (4) establish and execute a public awareness campaign to inform the general public and private sector businesses on ways they can deter, detect, prevent, protect against, and respond to terrorist explosive attacks. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to partner with other federal, state, local, and tribal agencies, nonprofit organizations, universities, and the private sector to: (1) develop a pilot program that includes a domestic breeding program for explosives detection canines; (2) increase the number of capability assessments of explosives detection canine units; (3) continue development of a scientifically-based training curriculum to enhance consensus-based national training and certification standards to provide for the effective use of explosives detection canines; and (4) continue engagement in explosives detection canine research and development activities through partnerships with the Science and Technology Directorate and the Technical Support Working Group. Directs the Secretary to develop, periodically update, and report to Congress on a national strategy to prevent and prepare for terrorist explosive attacks in the United States. (Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary, acting through the Under Secretary for Science and Technology, to: (1) ensure coordination and information sharing regarding nonmilitary research, development, testing, and evaluation activities relating to the detection and prevention of, protection against, and response to terrorist attacks using explosives or IEDs and the development of tools and technologies to neutralize and disable explosive devices; (2) coordinate with the Secretary of Defense and other federal department heads to ensure that military policies, procedures, activities, tools, and technologies to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks are adapted to nonmilitary uses; (3) establish a technology transfer program to facilitate the identification, modification, and commercialization of technology and equipment for use by governmental agencies, emergency response providers, and the private sector against such attacks; and (4) establish a working group to advise and assist in the identification of military technologies developed by the Department of Defense (DOD) or the private sector to protect against and respond to explosive attacks. (Sec. 4) Amends the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 to direct the Comptroller General to utilize explosives detection canine teams of TSA and other DHS agencies to strengthen security and capacity. (Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary to submit a report to specified congressional committees on the administration of canine procurement activities by DHS to deter, prevent, detect, and protect against terrorist explosive attacks in the United States that includes consideration of the feasibility of reducing the price paid for the procurement of untrained canines, including by utilizing an expanded pool of breeds, procuring canines from domestic breeders, and acquiring canines from animal shelters, rescue societies, and other not-for-profit entities."
