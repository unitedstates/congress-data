    "text": "A Roadmap for America's Energy Future - Deems the Draft Proposed Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2010-2015 to have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior as a final oil and gas leasing program in full compliance with specified environmental law. Directs the Secretary to conduct a lease sale every 270 days in each outer Continental Shelf (OCS) planning region for which there is a commercial interest in purchasing federal oil and gas leases for OCS production. Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) to: (1) modify the OCS leasing program; and (2) direct the Secretary to include, in each 5-Year Program, lease sales proposals offering for oil and gas leasing at least 75% of the available unleased acreage within each OCS Planning Area. Prescribes requirements for coordination with adjacent states regarding pipeline construction for crude oil, petroleum products, and natural gas. Prohibits, on either federal OCS or state waters, uses that are incompatible with: (1) oil and gas leasing; or (2) full oil or natural gas exploration and production on geologically prospective tracts. Requires the Secretary to accept, in satisfaction of mitigation requirements, proposals for mitigation measures on a site away from the area impacted by exploration and production activities. Directs the Secretary to establish a leasing program for oil, gas and oil shale within the Alaska Coastal Plain (ANWR). Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (ANILCA) to repeal the prohibition against production of oil and gas from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Allocates to the state of Alaska 50% of federal revenues derived from federal oil and gas leasing operations. Establishes in the Treasury the Coastal Plain Local Government Impact Aid Assistance Fund. Requires the Secretary to hold a lease sale offering an additional 10 parcels for lease for research, development, and demonstration of oil shale resources. Directs the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to develop, construct, and operate a coal-to-liquids facility. Amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to repeal the limitation on federal agency contracting for procurement and acquisition of alternative fuels with respect to associated lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish the American-Made Energy Trust Fund to receive certain revenues from oil, gas, and oil shale leases. Directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to: (1) issue operating permits for 200 new commercial nuclear reactors; (2) continue to review certain license applications to construct the nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain (Nevada); (3) use certain funds to develop, construct, and operate a facility for the recycling of spent nuclear fuel; (4) establish a process for licensing facilities for the recycling of spent nuclear fuel; and (5) deem that sufficient capacity will be available for spent nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste disposal. Directs the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to promulgate regulations to conduct reverse auctions to award funds from the American-Made Energy Trust Fund to owners or operators of qualified renewable energy facilities to generate electric energy. Establishes in the legislative branch the National Commission on Outer Continental Shelf Oil Spill Prevention to examine and report on the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill of 2010."
