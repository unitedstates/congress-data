Allows a service-disabled veteran a subsistence allowance for six (under current law, two) months of full-time employment training following completion of a vocational rehabilitation program. Allows such a veteran who has unused VA educational assistance entitlement to use such assistance to pursue a program of education as part of a vocational rehabilitation program, as long as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs approves the educational, professional, or vocational objective chosen by the veteran. Directs the Secretary to provide reimbursement for child care to a veteran who is participating in a vocational rehabilitation program and is the sole caretaker of a child. Requires the Secretary to include in annual budget materials submitted to Congress information on veterans receiving vocational rehabilitation assistance who: (1) became employed; and (2) achieved independence in daily living."
