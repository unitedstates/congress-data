Requires the FTC to enforce this Act. Defines \"major broadband Internet service provider\" as a broadband Internet service provider that, directly or through an affiliate, provides broadband Internet service to 2 million or more subscribers. Defines \"volume usage service plan\" as any choice of service offerings to a residential consumer that includes two or more different sets of rates, terms, or conditions directly or indirectly based on the amount of data transmitted to or from the consumer within a fixed period of time. Includes nonprofit organizations or higher education institutions in the term \"residential consumer.\""
