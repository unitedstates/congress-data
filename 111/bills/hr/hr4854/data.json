Amends the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA) to require the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to include in the HUD-1 settlement form: (1) an item for identifying any home inspection conducted in connection with the settlement; (2) when such inspection was or is to be completed; (3) the inspection's cost; (4) whether the charge for such inspection is imposed on the borrower or the seller; and (5) whether such charge has been paid before settlement and a copy of such receipt is included with the settlement documents."
