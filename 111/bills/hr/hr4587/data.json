Waives such prohibition for any measure increasing the statutory limit on the public debt if statutory limits are in place on the total level of such spending for each of 10 consecutive fiscal years beginning with the first fiscal year in which such increase would occur. Repeals Rule XXVIII (Statutory Limit on Public Debt) of the Rules of the House (known as the \"Gephardt Rule\") which provides for mandatory adjustment of the statutory limit on the public debt to conform to a budget resolution."
