Permits a recipient of grant funds to use the funds to provide assistance for startup costs, worker training, relocation costs, planning, and other projects identified by the recipient that are consistent with the purposes of this Act. Limits: (1) the federal share of the cost of projects carried out using funds authorized by this Act to 50%; and (2) the portion of the non-federal share of project costs that may be provided through in-kind contributions to 50%."
