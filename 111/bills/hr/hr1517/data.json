Directs the United States to: (1) indemnify and hold such individual whose appointment is converted harmless from any claim arising from any event, act, or omission that arises from the exercise of such individual's official duties; and (2) provide to such individual (including any dependents) services and monetary payments which are equivalent to those provided to other CBP employees in similar positions in the same country of assignment and for which such individual was not eligible by reason of such individual's overseas limited appointment. Directs the Commissioner to implement such a conversion in a manner that: (1) meets the operational needs of the CBP; and (2) is not disruptive to the employees affected. Provides that: (1) nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect the pay of any individual for services performed before the date of his or her conversion; and (2) the authority of the Commissioner to convert an employee under this Act shall terminate two years after enactment."
