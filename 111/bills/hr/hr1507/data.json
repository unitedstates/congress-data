    "text": "Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2009 - Amends federal personnel law relating to whistleblower protections to expand the concept of protected disclosure to include lawful disclosures without restriction to time, place, form, motive, context, forum, or prior disclosure, including a disclosure made in the ordinary course of an employee's duties. Defines evidentiary standards applicable to whistleblower disclosures. Includes as a prohibited personnel practice against whistleblowers the implementation or enforcement of any nondisclosure policy, form, or agreement, a suspension or revocation of a security clearance, and an investigation of a whistleblower. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study of security clearance revocations of federal employees at a select sample of executive branch agencies and report to Congress on such study. Provides for expedited review of Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) decisions interpreting whistleblower protections in U.S. district court. Grants authority to MSPB to determine whether whistleblower security clearances were properly suspended or revoked. Expands whistleblower protection to employees or former employees of a national security agency. Prohibits reprisals against such employees, including revocations of their security clearances, for making disclosures. Extends whistleblower protections to contractors, employees of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and individuals who disclose censorship related to federal research or technical information."
