(Sec. 607) Amends federal criminal law to extend whistleblower protection against retaliation by a subsidiary or affiliate of an issuer. (Sec. 608) Denies the PCAOB authority either to withhold information from Congress, or to prevent compliance with a federal court order when an action is commenced by either the United States or the PCAOB.
