Sets minimum requirements for such form, including that it: (1) use standard, plain language for purposes of explaining covered services and benefits and restrictions; (2) use standard, consistent definitions for coverage of services and benefits; (3) provide for a standard, consistent disclosure of key provisions, such as monthly premiums, the maximum daily or monthly benefit, and the extent to which benefit amounts will be adjusted for inflation; and (4) have a standard, consistent format with respect to font, color, and type size to allow for easy comparison and not exceed one single-sided page. Requires the Secretaries of the Treasury and HHS to promulgate regulations requiring issuers of qualified long-term care insurance contracts to use such form for marketing such contracts."
