Establishes in the Executive Office of the President a White House Office on Global Hunger and Food Security. Directs the President to appoint, as head of such Office, a Coordinator on Global Hunger and Food Security to implement a comprehensive government-wide strategy to address global hunger and food security and to ensure that the strategy: (1) contributes to achieving the Millennium Development Goal of reducing global hunger by half not later than 2015 and to advancing the United Nations Comprehensive Framework for Action with respect to global hunger and food security; and (2) is integrated into any review or development of a federal strategy for global development. Requires: (1) the Office to work with all relevant federal departments and agencies; (2) the Coordinator to establish, schedule, and administer a high-level, government-wide global hunger and food security meeting each week; and (3) the Comptroller General to submit to Congress biennial reports evaluating the design, implementation, and federal coordination of the strategy. Establishes a Permanent Joint Select Committee on Hunger. Expresses the sense of Congress that not less than $50.36 billion should be made available for FY2010-FY2014 for federal programs addressing global hunger and food security."
