    "text": "Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Reauthorization Act of 2010 - Amends the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (Act) to reauthorize juvenile delinquency prevention programs through FY2015. Requires the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to include in the annual report of the Office information on juveniles held in state and local secure detention and correctional facilities, including pregnant juveniles, the number of status offenders (e.g., runaways and truants), and criteria for evidence-based programs for juvenile delinquency prevention. Expands requirements for state plans under the Act to require: (1) statewide compliance with the core requirement of the Act for protection of incarcerated juveniles; (2) alternatives to detention for juveniles in need of mental health or substance abuse treatment; (3) programs to improve the recruitment, selection, training, and retention of professionals working in juvenile delinquency prevention programs; (4) the identification of racial and ethnic disparities among juveniles in the juvenile justice system; and (5) the development of policies, procedures, and training to eliminate the use of dangerous practices, unreasonable restraints, and unreasonable isolation, including by developing effective behavior management techniques. Eliminates as a requirement under the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grant Program evidence that Indian tribe grant applicants perform law enforcement functions. Authorizes the Administrator to make incentive grants to state and local governments for juvenile delinquency prevention programs, including evidence based programs for the prevention and reduction of juvenile delinquency, personnel recruitment and training, and mental health and substance abuse screening and treatment. Includes mentoring programs as a permissible grant purpose under the Incentive Grant Program for Local Delinquency Prevention. Reauthorizes such grant program through FY2015. Prevention Resources for Eliminating Criminal Activity Using Tailored Interventions in Our Neighborhoods Act of 2010 or the PRECAUTION Act - Establishes the National Commission on Public Safety Through Crime Prevention to: (1) carry out a comprehensive study of the effectiveness of certain crime and delinquency prevention and intervention strategies; and (2) make initial and final public reports on such strategies to specified federal and state officials. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct by October 1, 2010, a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of: (1) the performance of the Office of Juvenile Justice Delinquency and Prevention, its functions, programs, and grants; and (2) a sampling of grantees that receive federal funds from such Office, including a review of internal controls to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of funds."
