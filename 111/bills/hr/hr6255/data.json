Permits a mail-order pharmacy to substitute a generic drug for a brand name drug or a brand name drug for a generic drug if the mail order pharmacy: (1) notifies the customer that the pharmacy will request that the prescriber provide an authorization to make such a substitution; and (2) after providing such notification, obtains the express written authorization of the prescriber of the drug to make such a substitution. Requires the prescriber to provide notice to the customer of an authorization. Permits the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to assess civil penalties against a mail-order pharmacy for violations of this Act. Declares that this Act preempts state laws to the extent any are inconsistent with this Act."
