Fort Pulaski National Monument Lease Authorization Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to lease to the Savannah Bar Pilots Association or a successor organization up to 30,000 square feet of land and improvements in Fort Pulaski National Monument in Georgia at the location on Cockspur Island that has been used continuously by the Association since 1940. Instructs the Secretary to require a rental fee based on fair market value adjusted, as deemed appropriate, for amounts to be expended by the lessee for property preservation and related expenses. Requires the deposit of the proceeds received from such fee into a special account in the Treasury related to rental payments made under leases for the use of buildings and associated property administered as part of the National Park System. Requires a lease entered into under this Act to be made for a term of up to 10 years and, at the Secretary's discretion, for successive terms of up to 10 years at a time and to include any terms and conditions necessary for the protection of the resources of the Monument and the public interest. Exempts the lease authorized by this Act, except as provided above, from certain provisions related to the leasing of buildings and property administered as part of the System and the leasing of federal buildings and property."
