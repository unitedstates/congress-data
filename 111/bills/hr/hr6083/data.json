    "text": "Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Reauthorization Act of 2010 - Amends the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005 to revise the National Cord Blood Inventory Program, including to: (1) remove the cap of 150,000 new units of cord blood to be made available for transplantation under the Program; and (2) require an application under the Program to include a\u00a0 plan for, and demonstration of, ongoing measurable progress toward achieving self-sufficiency of cord blood unit collection and banking operations. Extends financial support provided under the Program for an additional five years. (Current law allows financial support for a maximum of ten years.) Sets forth requirements for such an extension, including that a qualified cord blood bank demonstrate a superior ability to satisfy the requirements of such Program and achieve the overall goals for which the contract was awarded. Redefines the term \"first-degree relative\" to exclude a parent. Reauthorizes appropriations for FY2011-FY2015 for the collection or maintenance of cord blood. Amends the Public Health Service Act to revise the requirements of the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program to: (1) require studies and projects under such Program to include exploring novel approaches or incentives to expand the number of cord blood unit collection sites partnering with federally-supported cord blood banks; and (2) revise privacy provisions to protect the privacy of patients and donors in accordance with federal and state law. Reauthorizes appropriations for such Program for FY2011-FY2015. Directs the Comptroller General to submit a report to the relevant congressional committees and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) that reviews studies, demonstration programs, and outreach efforts to increase\u00a0 cord blood unit donation and collection."
