Directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to modify certain federal regulations regarding carry-on baggage to require air carrier carry-on baggage programs to limit each passenger boarding an aircraft to one piece of carry-on baggage and one personal item. Authorizes air carriers to establish smaller size limitations for such items. Specifies items and persons to be excluded from TSA and FAA carry-on baggage limitations, including cockpit and cabin crew in uniform. Requires the TSA and FAA to notify passengers via their websites of federal carry-on baggage and personal item limitations. Requires the TSA to: (1) to install a template with a maximum depth and width to prevent the conveyor belt passage at each checkpoint of carry-on baggage or personal items that exceed federal size limitations; and (2) require passengers with carry-on baggage or personal items that exceed such limitations to check them in."
