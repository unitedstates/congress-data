Establishes that net metering standard and related requirements. Requires retail electric suppliers to make net metering available to customer-generators on a first-come-first-served basis. Directs FERC to: (1) publish model standards for the physical connection between local distribution systems and qualified generation units; and (2) modify its Small Generator Interconnection Procedures to expedite permitting of qualified generation units up to 2,000 kilowatts Directs FERC to promulgate regulations to ensure that simplified contracts will be used for the interconnection of qualified generation units by a retail electric supplier or local distribution company"
