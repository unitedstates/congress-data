Requires the Devil's Staircase Wilderness Area to be administered by the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior, subject to valid existing rights. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to decommission any National Forest System road within the wilderness boundaries and to convert Forest Service Road 4100 to a trail for primitive recreational use. Deems land acquired by the United States within the boundary of the Wilderness Area as part of the Devil's Staircase Wilderness. Specifies this Act's effect on fish and wildlife, buffer zones, and tribal rights. Withdraws the federal land designated as a wilderness area by this Act from all forms of: (1) entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; (2) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and (3) disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing or mineral materials. Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate Franklin and Wasson Creeks in Oregon as wild rivers and as components of the Wild and Scenic Rivers System."
