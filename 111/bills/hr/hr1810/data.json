Directs the Secretary of the Interior to issue all regulations necessary to implement the Oil Share, Tar Sands, and Other Strategic Unconventional Fuels Act of 2005 with respect to oil shale. Directs the Secretary, immediately after issuing such regulations, to offer for leasing: (1) additional 160-acre tracts of lands the Secretary considers necessary for research and development of oil shale resources; and (2) public lands, for commercial exploration, development, and production of oil shale resources, in states for which the Secretary finds sufficient support and interest."
