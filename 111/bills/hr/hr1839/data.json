Requires the Administrator to carry out a networking program through SCORE that provides small businesses with the opportunity to make business contacts in their industry or geographic region. Renames the Service Corps of Retired Executives as SCORE. Eliminates the Active Corps of Executives. Authorizes appropriations for SCORE for FY2010-FY2011."
