Repeals the limitation to one payment only to an individual regardless of whether the individual is entitled to, or eligible for, more than one benefit or cash payment. Entitles such individual to a payment in each of calendar years 2009 and 2010. Rescinds from the unobligated balance of the discretionary appropriations made available by division A of such Act the amount determined by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to be required to offset the increase in spending resulting from this Act."
