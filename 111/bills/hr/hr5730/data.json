Rescinds certain unobligated amounts allocated under the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (STURAA) for federal-aid system demonstration projects. Rescinds unobligated amounts under the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) for certain high priority projects in which less than 10% of the amount authorized for such projects has been obligated. Repeals the designation of a specified segment of U.S. Route 322 as an addition to Corridor O in Pennsylvania on the Appalachian development highway system. Rescinds a specified amount of unallocated funds authorized for FY2005-FY2009 under the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) for the high priority projects program. Requires the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to report to Congress on each authorized project in the following categories that has inactive funds or that has been completed in the previous fiscal year: (1) each high priority project authorization under TEA-21; (2) each project of national and regional significance, highway construction project in a corridor of national significance, high priority project authorization, and transportation improvement project under SAFETEA-LU; and (3) specified bridge program set-aside projects. Requires such report also to specify for each project the amount of funds authorized, any unobligated balance of funds, and a reference to its public law and section and project number."
