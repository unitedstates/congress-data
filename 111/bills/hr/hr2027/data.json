Prohibits the use of whole-body imaging technology as the sole or primary method of screening aircraft passengers. Allows its use only if another method of screening, such as metal detection, demonstrates cause for preventing a passenger from boarding an aircraft. Requires that passengers: (1) be provided information on the operation of such technology and specified related matters, including privacy policies and the right to request a pat-down search; and (2) be offered such a pat-down search in lieu of such screening. Prohibits the storage, transfer, sharing, or copying in any form of an image of a passenger generated by whole-body imaging technology after a boarding determination is made. Imposes criminal penalties upon any U.S. officer or employee who knowingly stores, transfers, shares, or copies whole-body screening images."
