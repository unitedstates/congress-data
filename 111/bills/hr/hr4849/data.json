(Sec. 304) Treats rental income from real estate as a trade or business activity for tax reporting purposes. (Sec. 305) Expands the continuous tax levy on payments to vendors for goods and services to include payments for all property, goods, or services and for delinquent employment taxes owed by such vendors. (Sec. 307) Expands rules for valuing assets in grantor retained annuity trusts to require: (1) that the right to receive fixed amounts from an annuity last for a term of not less than 10 years and that such fixed amounts not decrease during the first 10 years of the annuity term; and (2) that the remainder interest have a value greater than zero when transferred. (Sec. 308) Increases the penalties for failure to file correct information returns and for intentional disregard of reporting requirements. (Sec. 309) Excludes from the definition of \"cellulosic biofuel\" for purposes of the cellulosic biofuel producer tax credit any processed fuel with an acid number greater than 25.
