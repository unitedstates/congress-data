Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to make grants to states to carry out an American Heritage Program through state arts agencies. Allocates .5% of the tax revenues attributable to Internet gambling to the American Heritage Block Grant Fund to finance the American Heritage Program. Amends the Social Security Act to establish the Transitional Assistance Trust Fund to finance state plans for transitional education and job training assistance to individuals who are, or were formerly, in foster care. Allocates 25% of the tax revenues attributable to Internet gambling to the Trust Fund."
