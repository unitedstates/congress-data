(Current law authorizes payment denial for up to five crop years.) Requires that a person or legal entity that received benefits while ineligible due to excess income repay such amounts fully. Directs the Secretary to request the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to verify the income-related eligibility of a benefit applicant, and deny benefits to a person or entity determined to be ineligible. Authorizes Farm Service Agency reconsideration of a denial."
