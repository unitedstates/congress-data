    "text": "Investment in Commercial Real Estate Act of 2010 - Exempts servicers of commercial mortgage loans from liability for entering into a loan modification or workout plan if certain requirements are met. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) reduce the recovery period for depreciation of residential rental and nonresidential real property (thus accelerating such depreciation); and (2) extend from two to five years the carryback period for deducting net operating losses. Requires federal banking agencies to implement a system of dynamic provisioning for investment and loan loss reserves that meets specified requirements and is applicable to all depository institutions before January 1, 2011. Requires depository institutions that make or hold permanent commercial mortgage loans to submit to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in each calendar quarter the aggregate amount of permanent commerical mortgage loans that matured during the quarter but did not fully amortize, were current prior to maturity, had adequate cash flows to continue paying interest and principal, and were not renewed at maturity or were renewed at a lower principal balance. Terminates this requirement after March 31, 2013. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a study and report to Congress on commercial mortgage credit."
