Requires a federal agency to make the program performance report for each program under its control available to Congress upon request. Establishes the Federal Program Sunset Commission, which shall: (1) submit to Congress a report analyzing the interaction between authorizing legislation and appropriations legislation and the effects of such interaction; (2) establish a schedule to review each activity or project (program) listed in the program and financing schedules of the annual federal budget every 10 years; (3) conduct a review of the efficiency of operation and public need for each such program according to that schedule; and (4) annually report to Congress on the programs reviewed, including recommendations regarding whether each program should be abolished or reorganized and whether the functions of any programs should be consolidated, transferred, or reorganized in an agency or among agencies and proposals for appropriate administrative or legislative action. Terminates the Commission 11 years after this Act's enactment unless reauthorized. Requires the Comptroller General: (1) in cooperation with the Director of the Congressional Research Service (CRS), to submit to Congress and update annually an inventory of all federal programs, with budgetary information to be provided by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO); and (2) organize the inventory by program areas that are reflective of national needs and agency missions and that are appropriate for the exercise of the review requirements of this Act. Requires the Comptroller General, the Director of CRS, and the Director of CBO to permit the mutual exchange of information that would aid in inventory compilation. Sets forth requirements for, and procedures for congressional consideration of, proposed legislation to abolish programs."
