    "text": "Expanded Health Insurance Options Act of 2009 - Authorizes states to enter into arrangements to form interstate compacts under which health insurance issuers would offer coverage meeting the requirements of this Act under a unified regulatory structure governing the issuance, renewal, rating, mandated benefits, and similar items of coverage. Requires each compact to ensure that individuals who are insured in a participating state are able to access an independent external appeals process to review decisions made by health insurance issuers relating to coverage. Makes a participating state in which an insurance issuer is licensed responsible for the enforcement of applicable laws, regulations, agreements, and orders governing health insurance issuers and coverage. Authorizes a participating state in which a covered individual resides to require a health insurance issuer to pay premiums and taxes, submit to an examination of financial condition, and comply with state laws regarding fraud and abuse and unfair claims practices."
