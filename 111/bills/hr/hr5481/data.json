Requires the Commission, before issuing such a subpoena, to notify the Attorney General (or a designee) of the Commission's intent to issue a subpoena, the identity of the witness, and the nature of the testimony sought. Prohibits the Commission from issuing a subpoena if the Attorney General objects on the basis that the taking of the testimony is likely to interfere with any: (1) federal or state criminal investigation or prosecution; or (2) pending investigation under the Civil False Claims Act or other federal statute providing for civil remedies, or any civil litigation to which the United States or any of its agencies is or is likely to be a party. Requires the Commission, in the case of contumacy of any person issued a subpoena or refusal by such person to comply with the subpoena, to request the Attorney General to seek enforcement of the subpoena in any U.S. district court for a district in which a person issued a subpoena under this Act resides, is served, or may be found, or where the subpoena is returnable. Deems failure to obey an order requiring the subpoenaed person to appear at any designated place to testify or produce documentary or other evidence to be contempt of court."
