Prescribes requirements for an investment advice program. Prohibits a fiduciary of an individual account plan that permits a participant or beneficiary to direct the investment of assets in the individual account from appointing or contracting with an investment adviser that is not an independent adviser. Requires an independent adviser, before providing investment advice, to provide a written notification: (1) of the past performance and historic rates of return of investment options available to the plan, together with comparisons to relevant benchmarks; and (2) that such investment adviser is acting as a fiduciary of such plan."
