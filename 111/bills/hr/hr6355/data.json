Defines an \"eligible partnership\" as a partnership between a local educational agency (LEA) and one or more of the following: (1) an institution of higher education (IHE); (2) another LEA; (3) a public elementary or secondary school or schools; or (4) a government statistical agency experienced in improving the quality of statistics teachers. Requires partnership activities to be consistent with a statistical literacy plan that each state is required to develop and have approved by the Secretary of Education before receiving its formula grant. Authorizes the Secretary to award competitive grants to states that lack the resources to develop an adequate plan so that they can do so. Authorizes the Secretary to award competitive grants to IHEs, governmental statistical agencies, or nonprofit organizations to: (1) develop model state standards and curriculum frameworks for statistics education; (2) disseminate information about proven and tested model statistics education programs that integrate statistics in other studies; (3) develop and implement new policy approaches to advancing statistics education; (4) conduct national statistics education studies; and (5) advance the widespread adoption by states and LEAs of statistics education content standards."
