States that under appropriations Acts providing funds for each of FY2011-FY2012 the total amount available for obligation for administrative expenses of an affected agency shall be the amount that would otherwise be available, reduced by 50% of the amount reported to have been expended before the enactment of this Act. Requires the head of each affected agency to report to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a determination of the amount of funds expended before the enactment of this Act, if any, by the agency, or any grantee or other recipient of assistance from the agency, for physical signage indicating that a project was funded by the ARRA. Requires OMB to determine, and report to Congress on, the allocation of such reduction among the accounts, and programs, projects, and activities within the accounts of each affected agency. Requires the head of each affected agency to deposit each amount of the reduction in the general fund of the Treasury for purposes of deficit reduction."
