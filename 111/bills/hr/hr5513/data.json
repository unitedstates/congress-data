Declares that: (1) royalty shall apply to all oil discharged under a deepwater lease, at a rate of not less than 12.5% fixed by the Secretary of the Interior in amount or value of any oil that is discharged; and (2) such royalty shall apply without regard to whether any of the oil is thereafter unavoidably lost. Declares April 15, 2010, the effective date of this Act (five days before the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico)."
