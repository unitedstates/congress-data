Abrogates and deems not applicable any provision of the Algiers Accords, entered into with Iran on January 19, 1981, that purports to prohibit a U.S. citizen from prosecuting any claim relating to such hostage taking in any U.S. court or to limit the jurisdiction of any U.S. court with respect to such matter. Requires the President to direct payments as provided for by this Act to a common fund to be established and administered by certified class representatives for U.S. citizens who were hostages in Iran."
