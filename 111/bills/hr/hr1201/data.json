Requires the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to: (1) initiate a rulemaking to establish a standardized checklist of risk evaluation factors which shall be used by pilots of aircraft providing emergency medical service to determine whether a mission should be accepted; and (2) initiate a collaborative effort with the air medical community to establish performance-based flight dispatch procedures for such pilots and to develop a method to measure compliance with such procedures. Requires the Administrator to initiate and complete: (1) a feasibility study of requiring flight data and cockpit voice recorders on new and existing aircraft used for emergency medical service operations; and (2) a rulemaking to require such devices on board such aircraft."
