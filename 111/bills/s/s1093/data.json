Increases civil penalties for violations of manufacturer corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to require: (1) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to implement a program to support deployment of low-greenhouse gas and fuel-saving technologies; and (2) the Secretary of Commerce to define and collect data on characteristics of the U.S. truck fleet, with emphasis on data relating to fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas performance."
