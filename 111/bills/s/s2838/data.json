Expands the 340B drug discount program to allow participation as a covered entity by certain children's hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers, sole community hospitals, and rural health clinics. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report on the cost in each state of dispensing prescription drugs under the Medicaid program. Requires states to use the report to assess the adequacy of Medicaid pharmacy dispensing fees. Repeals provisions terminating the grant program for the operation of state offices of rural health."
