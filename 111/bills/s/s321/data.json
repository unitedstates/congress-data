Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State to permit a passport card issued to a U.S. citizen to serve as proof of identify and citizenship if such citizen is departing from or entering the United States through an airport of entry for travel that terminates or originates in: (1) Bermuda; (2) Canada; (3) a Caribbean country; or (4) Mexico. Prohibits the Secretaries from increasing the passport card fee as a result of such requirement."
