Declares that such prohibitions shall not be construed to authorize the designation of information as sensitive security information to: (1) conceal a violation of law, inefficiency, or administrative error; (2) prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency; (3) restrain competition; or (4) prevent or delay the release of information that does not require protection in the interest of transportation security."
