Requires the head of each federal agency to establish: (1) a training program for supervisors that includes developing and discussing relevant goals and objectives with employees, motivating employees, fostering a work environment characterized by fairness, respect, equal opportunity, and attention paid to the merit of the work of employees, effectively managing employees with unacceptable performance, addressing reports of a hostile work environment, and meeting supervisor competencies established by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) or the supervisor's employing agency; (2) a training program on prohibited personnel practices, employee collective bargaining and union participation rights, and processes to enforce employee rights; and (3) a mentoring program for new supervisors. Requires: (1) new supervisors to complete such programs within one year after appointment, and (2) supervisors to complete the training programs every three years. Requires: (1) the Director of OPM to issue guidance to federal agencies on competencies supervisors are expected to meet in order to effectively manage, and be accountable for managing, the performance of employees; and (2) agencies to use such guidance to assess the performance and overall capacity of its supervisors."
