Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to provide additional funding for loan guarantees for: (1) constructing or retrofitting new or existing commercial scale electric generation units or industrial facility units for carbon capture and sequestration; and (2) constructing carbon dioxide transmission pipelines to transport carbon dioxide to sequestration sites or to sites where carbon dioxide will be used for hydrocarbon recovery."
