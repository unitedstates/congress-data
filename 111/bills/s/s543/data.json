Directs the Secretary to provide training to each eligible family caregiver under the program, and to certify the caregiver as qualified upon training completion. Requires caregivers to be paid for providing such services. Requires: (1) a review of VA and Department of Defense (DOD) respite care programs, as well as a study on enhancing the availability of such programs; (2) the provision of psychological and social support services to caregivers; and (3) a national survey of family caregivers of seriously disabled veterans and members."
