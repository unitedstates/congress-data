Directs the Commissioner of Social Security, with respect to the mandatory annual report of earnings by an individual entitled to a monthly insurance benefit, to develop procedures to avoid paying less than the correct amount of benefits to any such individual as a result, during the year, of a termination of employment or a significant reduction in hours of work."
