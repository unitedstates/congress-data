    "text": "Securing Aircraft From Explosives Responsibly: Advanced Imaging Recognition Act of 2010 or SAFER AIR Act of 2010 - Expresses the sense of Congress that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) should: (1) increase efforts to address privacy concerns regarding the screening of passengers using advanced imaging technology at airports; and (2) conduct additional testing of advanced imaging technology; and (3) deploy technology to standardize images, remove personally identifying characteristics, while providing transportation security officers with necessary information, and upgrade equipment to detect new threats without major capital expenditures. Declares it to be U.S. policy to aggressively seek, develop, and timely deploy primary screening technologies capable of detecting and protecting against threats to domestic and international aviation travel that cannot be effectively and efficiently detected by other technologies currently more commonly used, such as metal detectors. Directs the Secretary to ensure that advanced imaging technology and other advanced technology with capability to detect weapons, on-body plastic explosives, and other nonmetallic explosives are timely deployed for the primary screening of aircraft passengers. Requires the Secretary to provide passengers with an option for primary screening other than the use of such technologies. Requires all advanced imaging technology equipment used at airport checkpoints to be configured so that passenger: (1) images are not retained; and (2) facial features are blurred, while allowing detection of individual on-body threats. Prohibits DHS employees from having cameras or cell phones present while viewing such images. Requires such employees to communicate with other DHS employees using a wireless headset or another comparable method of communication that does not allow for the transmission of the image."
