Requires the Administrator, upon a state making such election, to: (1) reduce the applicable volume of renewable fuel by the percentage that reflects the national gasoline consumption attributable to the state; and (2) provide for the generation of credits for all gasoline provided through a fuel terminal in the state to be calculated as though the gasoline were blended with the maximum allowable ethanol content of gasoline to apply toward the applicable volume of renewable fuel."
