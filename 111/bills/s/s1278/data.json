    "text": "Consumers Health Care Act of 2009 - Establishes within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) an Office of Health Plan Management to establish and administer the Consumer Choice Health Plan to provide for health insurance coverage that is made available to all eligible individuals in the United States and its territories. Requires the Plan to comply with all regulations and requirements that are applicable with respect to other health insurance plans offered through the National Health Insurance Exchange. (The National Health Insurance Exchange has not been established.) Makes an individual or employer who is eligible to purchase coverage from a health insurance plan through the Exchange eligible to enroll in the Plan or purchase coverage for their employees from the Plan. Treats an individual's enrollment with the Plan as satisfying any requirement under federal law for such individual to demonstrate enrollment in health insurance or benefits coverage. Requires Medicare, Medicaid, and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP, formerly known as SCHIP) providers to provide services to any individual enrolled in the Plan for three years following establishment of the Plan, after which the provider may opt-out. Sets forth provisions governing payment rates. Requires repayment of funds necessary for the establishment of the Plan. Requires the Plan to be financially self-sustaining. Authorizes the establishment of the America's Health Insurance Trust as a nonprofit corporation, to provide information on, and oversight of, health insurance plans provided through the Exchange. Establishes in the Treasury the America's Health Insurance Trust Fund. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a fee on accident and health insurance policies and self-insured health plans."
