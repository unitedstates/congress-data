Requires the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce (Secretaries) to: (1) establish procedures for coordinating among federal agencies the development and dissemination of science and information necessary to address the impacts of climate change on natural resources; and (2) issue, with the Secretary of Agriculture, a climate change impact survey that identifies natural resources likely to be adversely affected by climate change. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to establish the National Fish and Wildlife Habitat and Corridors Information Program to develop a national database regarding fish and wildlife habitat and corridors. Requires the Secretaries and the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a Natural Resources Adaptation Science Advisory Board to advise federal agencies on the impacts of climate change and natural resources adaptation. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to establish the National Climate Change and Wildlife Center within the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Requires the President to establish a Natural Resources Climate Change Adaptation Panel to develop a Natural Resources Climate Change Adaptation Strategy. Requires each federal agency on the Panel to complete a natural resources adaptation plan. Requires each state seeking funds under this Act to prepare a state natural resources adaptation plan to address the ongoing and expected impacts of climate change on natural resources within the state. Establishes in the Treasury the Natural Resources Climate Change Adaptation Fund to provide funding to states to carry out natural resources adaptation activities."
