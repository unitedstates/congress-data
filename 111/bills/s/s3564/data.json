    "text": "Defines a \"federal STEM agency\" as any federal agency responsible for not less than 2% of total federal research and development funding in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to institutions of higher education, according to National Science Foundation (NSF) data. Requires the Director of Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to develop a policy for federal STEM agencies to carry out a program of workshops that educate program officers, members of grant review panels, and institution of higher education (IHE) STEM department chairs on how to implement methods that minimize the influence of gender bias in the evaluation of federal research grants and in the related academic advancement of the recipients of these grants. Authorizes federal STEM agencies to make grants to eligible organizations to carry out workshops. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to support at least one workshop every two years among the federal STEM agencies. Requires the Director to transmit a report to Congress determining such program's effectiveness. Requires the Secretary to develop a policy to extend research grant support for federally funded researchers who are caregivers. Requires federal STEM agencies to collect specified standardized annual demographic data for all applications and proposals for STEM research and development grants to IHEs. Provides for the publication of such data. Requires NSF to report statistical summary data on the demographics of STEM faculty at IHEs in the United States and report to Congress on how NSF will gather such data."
