    "text": "Return of Talent Act - (Sec. 2) Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish the Return of Talent Program to permit a lawful permanent resident (and certain family members) to return to his or her country of citizenship or nationality for up to one year (with a six-month extension) in order to contribute to such country's postconflict or natural disaster reconstruction activities or to provide medical services. Permits such a resident to be considered to be physically present and residing in the United States for naturalization purposes under specified conditions, including that: (1) such absence was solely to engage in postconflict or natural disaster reconstruction or to provide medical services in the resident's country of citizenship or nationality and the Secretary determines that the resident is a citizen or national of certain countries in which there was a conflict or disaster; or (2) the resident is a physician or other health care worker and such temporary absence was solely for the purpose of providing medical services in the resident's country of citizenship or nationality in which certain conflicts or disasters occurred; and (3) prior to, and after, such temporary absence the resident establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that his or her U.S. absence was solely for the purpose of performing such activities or services. Authorizes up to 1,000 aliens in any fiscal year to obtain such preservation of residence and physical presence. Authorizes the spouse and any minor, dependent unmarried son or daughter who resides in the same household as the Program participant to return to such alien's country of citizenship or nationality or to reenter the United States. (Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary to report to Congress regarding participating Program countries and reconstruction efforts and medical services provided. (Sec. 4) Authorizes FY2011 appropriations for United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to carry out this Act."
