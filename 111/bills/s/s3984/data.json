Requires the Director to: (1) advise the President, Congress, and other federal agencies and offices on museum, library, and information services so as to ensure the creation, preservation, organization, and dissemination of knowledge; (2) engage governmental agencies and private entities in assessing the museum, library, and information services needs of the people of the United States; (3) carry out programs of research and development, data collection, and financial assistance in order to extend and improve such services; and (4) ensure that those services are fully integrated into the nation's information and education infrastructures. Authorizes the Director to: (1) enter into interagency agreements to promote or assist with the museum, library, and information services-related activities of other federal agencies; and (2) use funds under this Act for the costs of such activities. Revises requirements for the coordination of policies and activities of the Institute with those of other federal agencies and offices to add requirements ensuring that such policies and activities are coordinated with: (1) programs and activities under the Head Start Act; (2) activities under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998; and (3) federal programs and activities that increase the capacity of libraries and museums to act as partners in economic and community development, education and research, improvement of digital literacy skills, and the dissemination of health information. Requires the Director to collaborate with the heads of relevant federal departments and agencies with respect to certain activities of libraries and museums. (Sec. 103) Revises requirements regarding the number and compensation of technical and professional employees appointed by the Director to help carry out the duties of the Institute.

Instructs the Director to widely disseminate the results of such policy research, analysis, and data collection. Authorizes the Director to: (1) enter into arrangements with federal agencies and other organizations to carry out the objectives; and (2) publish and disseminate reports, findings, studies, and other materials that were prepared to accomplish those objectives. Authorizes appropriations for FY2011-FY2016 to carry out this section. (Sec. 107) Authorizes the Director to hold hearings at such times and places as determined appropriate to carry out the Act's purposes. (Sec. 108) Requires the Director to establish an account from which to pay the federal administrative costs of carrying out the Act and limits the amount of appropriated funds placed in such account. Title II: Library Services and Technology - (Sec. 201) Expands and revises the purposes under the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA). (Sec. 202) Authorizes appropriations through FY2011-FY2016 to carry out the LSTA, including the Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program (established by section 207 of this Act). Repeals the limitation on the amount of funding under the LSTA that may be used for federal administrative costs. (Sec. 203) Increases the dollar amount of the minimum allotment available to each state and U.S. territory for grants under the LSTA. (Sec. 204) Requires each state plan to describe how the state library administrative agency will work with other state agencies and offices to coordinate resources, programs, and activities and leverage federal and state investment in elementary and secondary education, early childhood education, workforce development, and other federal programs and activities that relate to library services, including economic and community development and health information. (Sec. 205) Expands and revises the types of activities for which a state library administrative agency shall expend at least 96% of its grant funds. Restates the special rule regarding the apportionment of funds to meet the needs of an individual state. (Sec. 206) Expands and revises the activities that may be carried out under national leadership grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements. Permits the use of such a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement for the development of emergency plans that would ensure the preservation of knowledge and library collections in the event of a disaster. (Sec. 207) Establishes the Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program to: (1) recruit and educate the next generation of librarians; (2) develop faculty and library leaders; and (3) enhance the training and professional development of librarians and the library workforce to meet the needs of their communities. Authorizes the Director to enter into arrangements with libraries, library consortia and associations, institutions of higher education, and other entities to conduct projects that further the purpose of the Program. Title III: Museum Services - (Sec. 301) Expands the purposes of the Museum and Library Services Act relating to museum services.

Requires the Director to consider the equitable distribution of grants to various sizes and types of museums and to different U.S. geographic areas in awarding grants to pay the federal cost share for those activities. (Sec. 304) Authorizes appropriations through FY2011-FY2016 to carry out the Act's provisions relating to museum services and sets forth a special funding rule.
