Requires a USTR report to Congress on whether such goals have been met in revising the WTO rules, and if not, recommendations for: (1) legislation that impose a tax on imports from countries that employ indirect border taxes on goods and services; and (2) compensatory payments to U.S. exporters to neutralize the discriminatory effect of border taxes they have paid."
