Requires the federal land to be used according to the agreement entitled \"Cooperative Interlocal Agreement between the Board of Regents of the Nevada System of Higher Education on Behalf of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and the 99th Air Base Wing, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada,\" dated June 19, 2009. Prohibits the federal land from being used to compromise the national security mission or avigation rights of Nellis Air Force Base. Allows the System to use the federal land for educational or public purposes relating to the establishment, operation, growth, and maintenance of the System, including: (1) educational facilities; (2) housing for students, System employees, and educators; (3) student life and recreational facilities, public parks, and open space; (4) university and college medical and health facilities; (5) research facilities; and (6) any other public purpose that would be associated with an institution of higher education, consistent with the Recreation and Public Purposes Act. Permits the System: (1) to lease or otherwise provide property or space at the campuses to religious, public interest, community, or other groups for services and events of interest to the System or any community in southern Nevada; (2) to allow other communities in southern Nevada to use the campuses' facilities for educational and recreational programs; and (3) in conjunction with the city of Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, or Pahrump or Clark or Nye County to plan, finance (including through cost-share assistance), construct, and operate facilities for the city or counties on the federal land for educational or recreational purposes.
