    "text": "World War II War Crimes Accountability Act of 2009 - Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the United States should encourage extradition and prosecution of the remaining Nazi war criminals; (2) the Simon Wiesenthal Center should be commended for its historic work in bringing to light the atrocities of the Holocaust and in advancing justice for Nazi war criminals through Operation: Last Chance; and (3) the Office of Special Investigation of the Department of Justice (DOJ) is advancing U.S. foreign policy by bringing wanted World War II criminals to justice and should be commended for its actions. Directs the Attorney General, in evaluating the effect on U.S. law enforcement and security interests for purposes of a country's eligibility for visa waiver program designation, to consider the extent to which such country is: (1) cooperating in extraditing or prosecuting Nazi war criminals; and (2) admitting into its territory aliens ordered removed from the United States because of participation in Nazi persecution, genocide, torture, or extrajudicial killing. Authorizes the President, after congressional notification, to not terminate a country's designation based upon such evaluation if in the national interest."
