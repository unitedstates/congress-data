Prohibits judicial review of such determinations. Authorizes the Secretary of State (Secretary) to direct a consular officer to refuse or revoke a visa if necessary or advisable for U.S. foreign policy interests. Prohibits a decision by the Secretary to approve a visa from overriding a revocation or refusal determination by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Provides that the Secretary of Homeland Security: (1) shall review all visa applications and supporting documentation before adjudication; (2) shall have sole authority to issue, refuse, and revoke visas in Algeria, Canada, Egypt, Germany, Great Britain, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Syria, Turkey, Venezuela, and Yemen; and (3) may designate additional consular posts and embassies for on-site personnel to review visa applications if national or homeland security interests warrant such designation. States that if the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Secretary revokes a visa: (1) the relevant consular, law enforcement, and terrorist screening databases shall be immediately updated; and (2) look-out notices shall be posted to all DHS port inspectors and Department of State consular officers."
