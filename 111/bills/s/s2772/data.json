Requires the Inspector General of the Department of Justice (DOJ), beginning in FY2012, to conduct annual audits of not less than 10% of all grantees receiving funds under this Act to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Denies continued funding to a grant recipient who has an unresolved audit. Requires the Attorney General to: (1) report to the Judiciary Committees of Congress on November 1 of each year concerning the development and implementation of grants and strategies developed under this Act; (2) establish an information clearinghouse for data collected and best practices developed by grant recipients; and (3) ensure equitable distribution of grants among geographical regions and between urban and rural populations, including Indian tribes. Authorizes appropriations for FY2011-FY2015. Limits expenditures for salaries and DOJ administrative expenses to 5% of funds authorized."
