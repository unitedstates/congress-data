Requires such grants to be used to: (1) assess emerging industry pathways and the academic skills needed to succeed in them; (2) design school- and work-based curricula or programs to teach such skills; (3) implement the new curricula or programs in schools where at least 30% of the students are impoverished, that have graduation rates below their state's average, and whose community is experiencing significant or increased unemployment; and (4) evaluate best practices from such curricula or programs and disseminate them to other educational entities. Requires such curricula or programs to: (1) meet challenging state academic content standards; and (2) prepare students for both direct entry into careers with emerging industries in their communities and success in postsecondary education."
