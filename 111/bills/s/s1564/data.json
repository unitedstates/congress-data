    "text": "Arctic Oil Spill Research and Prevention Act of 2009 - Directs the Commandant of the Coast Guard to assess and take action to reduce the risk of, and improve the U.S. capability to respond to, a maritime disaster in the United States Beaufort and Chukchi Sea, including the prioritization of resources to address such issues as: (1) oil spill response capabilities and infrastructure; (2) coordinating contingency plans and agreements with U.S. agencies, industry, and foreign governments to respond to an Arctic oil spill; and (3) expansion of search and rescue capabilities, infrastructure, and logistics. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and in collaboration with other agencies with appropriate Arctic science expertise, to direct research and take action to improve the U.S. ability to conduct oil spill prevention, response, and recovery in Arctic waters. Requires the Secretary to request that the National Research Council conduct a risk assessment to identify and evaluate existing spill prevention and response standards and develop recommendations that will enhance safety and lessen the potential adverse environmental impacts of industrial activities in Arctic waters. Amends the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to make specified sums in the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund available annually to the Coast Guard, NOAA, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Minerals Management Service for Arctic oil spill research and development for FY2010-FY2014."
