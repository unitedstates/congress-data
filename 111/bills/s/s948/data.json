Directs each agency to submit a budget to OMB for administrative expenses that reflects a reduction from its FY2009 requests for such expenses of: (1) at least 3% for FY2010; (2) 6% for FY2011; (3) 9% for FY2012; and (4) 11% for FY2013. Requires the Director of OMB to review an agency's request for administrative expenses. Authorizes the Director to reduce such a request in the budget of any noncompliant agency to achieve the appropriate reduction."
