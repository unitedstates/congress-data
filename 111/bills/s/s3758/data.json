    "text": "Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act limit the somatic cell count in all dairy products sold, transported, or offered for sale or transport in interstate commerce to a maximum of 400,000 cells per milliliter of fluid milk, or equivalent, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). Authorizes the Secretary to lower the maximum somatic cell count after consideration of any recommendations submitted by the National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments. Requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations to require that the calculation of a herd average somatic cell count under this Act be made using a geometric, rather than an arithmetic, mean. Subjects any person that sells, transports, or offers for sale or transport in interstate commerce any dairy product in violation of this Act to a civil penalty."
