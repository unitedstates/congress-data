Defines \"oil fuel\" as any oil used as fuel in connection with the vessel's propulsion and auxiliary machinery. (Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to: (1) provide guidance to all vessel traffic personnel that clearly defines the use of authority to direct or control vessel movement when such direction or control is justified in the interest of safety; and (2) require vessel traffic personnel communications to identify the vessel, rather than the pilot, when vessels are operating in vessel traffic service pilotage areas. Requires the Secretary to identify, and report to Congress concerning, requirements for the necessary expansion, improvement, or construction of buildings, networks, communications, or other infrastructure to improve the effectiveness of existing vessel traffic service systems, or necessary to support recommended new vessel traffic service systems, including all necessary costs for construction, reconstruction, expansion, or improvement. Requires a review and validation of the recruiting, retention, training, and expansion of vessel traffic service personnel. (Sec. 4) Requires that at least one trained and experienced pollution investigator be on duty or on call at all times for each Coast Guard Sector Command. (Sec. 5) Modifies requirements regarding the duration of merchant mariner's documents and certificates of registry. (Sec. 6) Authorizes the extending of licenses, certificates of registry, and merchant mariner's documents in specified circumstances. Terminates that authorization on December 31, 2011. (Sec. 7) Limits to one the number of reports regarding port security terrorism exercises that the Coast Guard is required to submit each year to the House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations. (Sec. 8) Requires that compliance with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 be determined by reference to the latest statement titled \"Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation\" for this Act."
