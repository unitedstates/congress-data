    "text": "Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 - Title I: A Path to End Childhood Hunger - Subtitle A: National School Lunch Program - (Sec. 101) Amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to: (1) require the Secretary of Agriculture to provide performance awards to states with outstanding performance or substantial improvement in directly certifying children who receive other public assistance as eligible for free meals under the school lunch and breakfast programs; (2) establish performance benchmarks and require states with direct certification rates below the benchmarks to implement continuous improvement plans; and (3) state that direct certification for free school meals must require no action on the part of a child's household. (Sec. 102) Confers categorical eligibility for free school meals on foster children whose care and placement is the responsibility of a state foster care agency or a court. (Sec. 103) Establishes a demonstration project to determine the effectiveness of directly certifying children for free school meals using household income data from Medicaid. Requires local educational agencies (LEAs) selected to participate in the project to certify directly for free school meals all children who are receiving Medicaid and whose household income does not exceed 133% of the federal poverty line. Phases-in the demonstration project during the three school years beginning in 2012. Requires that for the 2014 school year and each subsequent school year, selected LEAs collectively serve 10% of the students certified for free and reduced price meals nationwide. Requires the Secretary to estimate the cost of direct certification with Medicaid for each of the two years of the demonstration project and to submit an interim report to Congress by October 1, 2014, and a final report by October 1, 2015, on project results. (Sec. 104) Establishes new mechanisms by which schools or LEAs with very high proportions of low-income children can receive federal reimbursement for free or reduced price meals without collecting individual paper applications from households. Allows certain schools and LEAs to receive reimbursements for free or reduced price meals pursuant to a formula that is based on their direct certification rates. Limits participation to schools and LEAs that directly certify at least 40% of their students, but allows the Secretary after July 1, 2014, to set a lower minimum threshold for participation. Requires the Secretary to: (1) identify alternatives to the daily counting of meals served by category and the use of annual applications as the basis of reimbursements for free or reduced-price school meals; (2) consider, in identifying such alternatives, recommendations of the Committee on National Statistics of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) regarding the use of census data or other data sources; and (3) consider the use of periodic socioeconomic surveys of households of children attending school in school food authority areas. Allows recommendations that provide accurate and effective means of providing meal reimbursement consistent with the eligibility status of students to be implemented by schools or school food authorities, or further tested through demonstration projects. Requires schools and school food authorities reimbursed on the basis of such recommendations to provide free meals to all their students under the school lunch and breakfast programs and cover, from nonfederal sources, the costs of serving such meals that exceed the assistance received under such programs. (Sec. 105) Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to require the Secretary, subject to the availability of appropriations, to award competitive grants to states and, through them, subgrants to LEAs for the creation, maintenance, or expansion of school breakfast programs at schools where at least 40% of the students are eligible for free or reduced-price school lunches under the school lunch program. Requires such school breakfast programs to have a nutritional education component. Authorizes such schools to extend the period during which breakfast is available, including during the school day. Requires the Secretary to provide states with information regarding the most effective mechanisms by which to increase school breakfast participation at such schools. Gives priority to LEAs that adopt such mechanisms or have schools in which at least 75% of the students are eligible for free or reduced-price school lunches. Directs subgrantees, at least 180 days before the end of a grant term, to evaluate whether it would be cost-effective for such schools to provide universal free breakfasts under the school breakfast program. Subtitle B: Summer Food Service Program - (Sec. 111) Eliminates the limitation on the number of sites private nonprofit summer food service program sponsors may operate. (Currently, private nonprofit sponsors may not operate more than 25 sites and each site is restricted to no more than 300 children.) (Sec. 112) Requires states to ensure that school food authorities cooperate with participating service institutions to inform families of the availability and location of summer food service program meal sites and the availability of the school breakfast program. (Sec. 113) Directs the Secretary to award competitive summer food service grants to states to provide summer program sponsors with technical assistance, assistance with site improvement costs, and other innovative activities that improve and encourage sponsor retention. Gives priority to states with: (1) significant low-income child populations; and (2) plans that demonstrate innovative approaches to retaining and supporting programs after the grant funds expire. Subtitle C: Child and Adult Care Food Program - (Sec. 121) Makes family or group day care homes in an area eligible for higher child and adult care food program (CACFP) reimbursement rates as tier I homes if they are located in an area served by a school enrolling students (currently, elementary students) at least 50% of whom are certified as eligible to receive free or reduced price meals under the school lunch or breakfast programs. (Sec. 122) Expands to all states the Secretary's authority to reimburse child care providers participating in the CACFP at-risk afterschool program for meals served to children during afterschool hours. Requires the Secretary to issue annually both guidelines and a handbook for at-risk afterschool programs. Subtitle D: Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children - (Sec. 131) Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to allow states to certify children participating in the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children (WIC program) for up to one year if they receive regular health and nutrition assessments. Subtitle E: Miscellaneous - (Sec. 141) Amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to direct the Secretary to study: (1) the causes and consequences of childhood hunger and food insecurity; and (2) characteristics of households with childhood hunger and food insecurity. Directs the Secretary to enter into agreements with, or provide grants to, public or private entities to conduct demonstrations projects that test innovative strategies to end childhood hunger, including alternative models for service delivery and benefit levels that promote the reduction or elimination of childhood hunger and food insecurity. Requires at least one demonstration project to be carried out on a rural Indian reservation that has a service population with a prevalence of diabetes exceeding 15%. Directs the Secretary to provide for an independent evaluation of each demonstration project, and report to Congress on the status of each demonstration project and the evaluation results. Requires evaluation results to be shared broadly with policy makers, service providers, and the public. (Sec. 142) Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to, or enter into agreements with, governors to carry out demonstration projects testing comprehensive and innovative strategies to end childhood hunger, including alternative models for service delivery and benefit levels that promote the reduction or elimination of childhood hunger by 2015. Requires each project to provide for: (1) a baseline and annual assessments of the prevalence and severity of very low food security among children in the state; (2) a collaborative planning process involving key stakeholders in the state; (3) an annual budget; (4) specific performance goals; and (5) an independent outcome evaluation. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on the status of each demonstration project and the results of project evaluations. Requires evaluation results to be shared broadly with policy makers, service providers, and the public. (Sec. 143) Requires the Secretary to examine the current policies and practices of states and LEAs regarding: (1) extending credit to children to cover their costs for reimbursable school lunches and breakfasts; and (2) providing nonreimbursable meals to children who are without funds. Requires the Secretary, based on such review, to: (1) report on the feasibility of establishing national standards for meal charges and the provision of alternate meals; and (2) make recommendations for implementing those standards. Authorizes the Secretary to implement national standards after considering: (1) the impact of overtly identifying low-income children; (2) how affected households will be provided assistance in establishing eligibility for free or reduced price meals; and (3) the potential financial impact on LEAs. Title II: Reducing Childhood Obesity and Improving the Diets of Children - Subtitle A: National School Lunch Program - (Sec. 201) Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations to update the meal patterns and nutrition standards for the school lunch and school breakfast programs based on recommendations made by the Food and Nutrition Board of the NAS National Research Council. Increases the reimbursement for lunches served under the school lunch program by school food authorities that are in compliance with such interim or final regulations. Requires the Secretary to provide funds to states for training, technical assistance, certification, and oversight activities relating to compliance with such regulations. (Sec. 202) Requires meals served under the school lunch program to offer students a variety of fluid milk that is consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. (Sec. 203) Requires schools participating in the school lunch program to offer free, potable water for consumption in the place where meals are served during meal service. (Sec. 204) Requires LEAs participating in the school lunch or breakfast programs to establish local school wellness policies for their schools. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations that require such LEAs to include: (1) goals for nutrition promotion and education, physical activity, and other school-based activities that promote student wellness; (2) nutrition guidelines for all foods available on school campuses during the school day; (3) the local community in the development, implementation, and periodic review of such policies; (4) public notification regarding the content and implementation of such policies; and (5) periodic assessments of and reporting on policy implementation. Requires the Secretary to provide information and technical assistance to LEAs, school food authorities, and states for use in establishing healthy school environments. Directs the Secretary, subject to the availability of appropriations, to report by January 1, 2014, on the implementation, strength, and effectiveness of the local school wellness policies. Repeals local wellness policy requirements under the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004. (Sec. 205) Establishes requirements regarding the nonfederal contribution required of school food authorities receiving federal reimbursement through the school lunch program.
