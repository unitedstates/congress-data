Defines a covered veteran as one: (1) in need of nursing home care for a service-connected disability; or (2) with a service-connected disability rated at 70% or more and in need of such care. Replaces provisions providing for payment of nursing home care at the lesser of the prevailing rate or the cost of daily care with provisions providing for payment at the applicable or prevailing rate in the area in which the state home is located. Directs the Secretary to reimburse a state home for any Medicare copayment required of a covered veteran. Permits a state home, in lieu of receiving payment under the above provisions, to elect to receive payment to furnish nursing home care to a veteran through a specified agreement entered into by the Secretary and the state home."
