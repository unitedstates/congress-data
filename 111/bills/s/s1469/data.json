Directs the Secretary of Defense to transfer a specified parcel of land as identified on the map entitled \"Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial, Proposed Boundary,\" dated August 2005, to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior if the land is excess to military needs. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into an agreement with the city of Concord, California, and the East Bay Regional Park District to establish and operate a facility for visitor orientation and parking, administrative offices, and curatorial storage for the Memorial. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Defense should promptly remediate any remaining environmental contamination relating to the land. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretaries of Defense and the Interior should work together to: (1) repair storm damage to the Memorial; and (2) develop a process by which future repairs and necessary modifications to the Memorial can be achieved in as timely and cost-effective a manner as possible."
