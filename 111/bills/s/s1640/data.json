Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a Lifestyle Rewards Program for eligible beneficiaries who have successfully completed an intensive lifestyle program and meet certain other requirements. Expresses the sense of Congress that the services provided under an intensive lifestyle treatment program: (1) would benefit individuals with chronic diseases who are not enrolled in the Medicare program; and (2) should be covered by all public and private payers."
