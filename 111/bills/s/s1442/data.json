Creates a grant program for the establishment of Indian Youth Service Corps so that Indian youth can carry out projects determined to be priorities by their tribes and communities. Permits Corps participants to work in the National Marine Sanctuary System, coral reefs, and other coastal, estuarine, and marine habitats, and other lands and facilities administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Requires the: (1) establishment of offices within the Department of the Interior, Forest Service, and NOAA for the coordination of Corps activities; and (2) designation of a Corps coordinator for each agency within the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, and Commerce that administers such activities.

Requires the Corps to consist of individuals between the ages of 16 and 25 who are enrolled as participants for a period of not more than two years. (Current law does not specify any time period for enrollment.) Requires a recruitment program and training program for Corps members. Describes the types of natural and cultural resources conservation projects that may be carried out by the Corps or any qualified youth or conservation corps on eligible service lands. Sets forth requirements regarding the use of Corps members to provide certain visitor and interpretation services. Authorizes the Secretaries to: (1) establish residential conservation centers; (2) provide temporary housing for the Corps and residential conservation centers; (3) as an appropriate natural and cultural resources conservation project, direct Corps participants to aid in the construction of residential conservation center facilities, including housing; (4) seek the assistance of the Secretary of Energy in identifying and using green building technologies and modular housing designs that may be adapted for such facilities; and (5) recruit mentors for Corps participants. Authorizes individual placements of consulting interns with federal land, coastal, and ocean management agencies to carry out management analysis. Authorizes cooperative agreements and competitive grants for tribes and tribally authorized organizations to establish Indian Youth Service Corps.
