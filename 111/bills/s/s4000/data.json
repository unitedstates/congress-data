Requires OPM to redetermine the postal surplus or supplemental liability as of the close of FY2010 and for each year thereafter through FY2043. Provides that if the result for a fiscal year is a surplus, that amount shall remain in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund until distribution is authorized as follows:(1) if there is a surplus as of the close of FY2010-FY2016, such amount or any part of it may be transferred to the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund; (2) if there is a surplus as of the close of FY2017 and each year thereafter, such amount or any part of it may be transferred to such Fund to pay any liability of such Fund; and (3) if all liability to such Fund is paid, amounts may be transferred to the Employees' Compensation Fund or to USPS for repayment of any obligation issued by it. Provides procedures for the transfer of such amounts. Authorizes arbitration boards to consider the financial condition of USPS in rendering decisions.

Establishes in USPS and the Commission an advocate for competition, who shall be responsible for promoting full and open competition, promoting the acquisition of commercial items, and challenging barriers to such acquisition. Directs USPS and the Commission: (1) to issue a policy on contracting officer delegations of authority; (2) to make any delegation of authority outside the functional contracting unit for the procurement of goods or services which exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold available on its website; and (3) within a specified after the award of any noncompetitive contract which exceeds such threshold, to make publicly available the documents containing its justification and approval.
