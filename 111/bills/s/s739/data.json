Requires the CPSC to: (1) designate drywall containing over 5% organic compounds by weight as a product with a product defect which constitutes a substantial product hazard; and (2) order manufacturers, distributors, and retailers of such drywall to cease distribution and notify all persons who handle such product to cease distribution. Requires that the order remain in effect until: (1) the CPSC publishes a determination that such a standard is not necessary; or (2) such a standard takes effect."
