Requires states that receive certain federal-aid highway funds to ensure that each glass bead used in pavement markings on or along federal-aid highway roads or highways does not contain more than 200 parts per million arsenic or lead. Requires the Secretary of Transportation, acting through the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), to withhold up to 5% of the apportionment of funds for any state that does not comply with such standards."
