Provides for set asides of grant funds to hire additional personnel to validate warrants entered into the NCIC database and for Indian tribes. Requires states that submit a grant renewal application to file with the Attorney General and appropriate county clerk's offices an annual report specifying: (1) the number of defendants, including indigent defendants, assessed or interviewed for pretrial release; (2) the number of failures to appear for a scheduled court appearance; and (3) the number and type of infractions committed by defendants while on pretrial release. Directs the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to provide state, local, and tribal government agencies the technology to make state and local warrant databases compatible and interoperative with the NCIC database. Directs the Comptroller General to report to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees on felony warrants issued by state, local, and tribal governments and entered into the NCIC database and on the apprehension and extradition of persons with active felony warrants. Directs the Attorney General to make grants to states and Indian tribes to extradite fugitives for prosecution. Requires states and Indian tribes applying for grants to report to the Attorney General on the number of active felony warrants they have issued."
