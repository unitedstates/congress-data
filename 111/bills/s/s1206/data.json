Requires an area to be determined to be a shortage area based on: (1) waiting times for patient care; (2) recruitment for unfilled positions; or (3) the ratio of the number of children who reside in the area who are in need of such pediatric subspecialty care to the number of pediatric subspecialists furnishing such services within 100 miles of the area."
