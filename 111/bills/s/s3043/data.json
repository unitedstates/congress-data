Requires each state that desires an implementation grant to develop quantifiable benchmarks for activities supported by such grants and submit them to the Secretary for approval. Requires states to use implementation grants to: (1) establish assessment tools and challenging academic content and achievement standards for engineering education; (2) develop or obtain effective engineering education curricula; (3) develop or improve engineering teacher training programs; (4) recruit qualified engineering teachers for needy schools; (5) facilitate distance learning and online education in engineering; and (6) invest in after-school engineering education programs. Directs the Institute of Education Sciences to support engineering education research and an evaluation of this Act's grant programs. Requires the Secretary to use the evaluation's findings to provide information to the public and technical assistance to states on best practices and promising innovations in K-12 engineering education."
