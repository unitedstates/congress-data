Revises provisions concerning treatment, prevention, and care goals to require that by the end of FY2013: (1) antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS and associated opportunistic infections or medical monitoring of HIV-seropositive people not in clinical need of retroviral treatment has been provided to at least 5 million people living in recipient countries; (2) at least 1 billion rapid tests for HIV/AIDS have been conducted on people living in such countries; and (3) every available intervention is provided to ensure that 100% of infants born to HIV-infected women in such countries are born uninfected and remain uninfected for at least the first year after birth. Sets forth administrative and per-patient funding limitations."
