Directs the Secretary to request NAIC to: (1) establish a Working Group to develop and issue a model disclosure form for marketing long-term care insurance policies; and (2) amend the model regulation and Act to require the use of such form. Requires: (1) the Secretaries of the Treasury and HHS to promulgate regulations requiring issuers of a qualified long-term care insurance contract under certain tax-qualified or Medicaid Partnership policies to use such form for marketing such contracts; and (2) each state to require any issuer of a long-term care insurance policy to use such form when marketing such a policy in the state."
