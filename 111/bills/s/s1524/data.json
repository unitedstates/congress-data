    "text": "Foreign Assistance Revitalization and Accountability Act of 2009 - (Sec. 4) States that it is U.S. policy to redefine the foreign assistance architecture and strengthen the capacity of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and related agencies to establish development policies and implement innovative and effective foreign assistance programs. (Sec. 5) Expresses the sense of Congress on the need to develop USAID's capacity to formulate international development policy and to integrate policy initiatives into its programs and activities. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require that in USAID, among the authorized statutory officers, there shall be not more than two Deputy Administrators, who shall assist the Administrator in all matters. Establishes in USAID: (1) an Assistant Administrator for Policy and Strategic Planning to assist in matters related to policy planning, strategic planning, program design, research, evaluation, and budget allocation and management; and (2) a Bureau for Policy and Strategic Planning whose primary duties shall include policy and long-term strategy development, evaluation of program effectiveness, and establishment of resource and workforce allocation criteria. Establishes within such Bureau an Office for Learning, Evaluation, and Analysis in Development which shall: (1) develop and conduct the complete range of activities relating to resource monitoring and project evaluation and analysis; (2) design a strategy for strengthening evaluation and research for foreign assistance programs; (3) develop an information clearinghouse capacity; and (4) partner with academic and national and international institutions. Directs the Administrator of USAID to report to Congress annually regarding the work of the Office. Authorizes FY2010-FY2011 appropriations. (Sec. 6) Establishes the Council on Research and Evaluation of Foreign Assistance which shall: (1) evaluate the impact of U.S. government foreign assistance programs and their contribution to, and impact on, U.S. policy objectives; and (2) cultivate an integrated research and development program that will incorporate best practices and promote innovative programs. Establishes a Council on Research and Evaluation of Foreign Assistance Advisory Board. Requires the Director of the Council to report: (1) annually to Congress regarding projected evaluations; (2) biennually to federal agencies responsible for implementing foreign assistance programs and to Congress regarding methodologies and best practices for evaluating the effectiveness of U.S. government foreign assistance programs; and (3) annually to Congress regarding Council programs and activities. Requires the Director to submit to Congress a strategic Council plan every two years. Directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to report to Congress within six years regarding Council operations. Authorizes FY2011-FY2016 appropriations. (Sec. 7) Directs the The Administrator to: (1) develop a comprehensive workforce and human resources strategy for modernizing the USAID workforce; (2) establish a workforce and human resources task force to participate in such strategy's development (which shall terminate two years after enactment of this Act); and (3) report to Congress within one year and every two years thereafter regarding such strategy. Directs GAO to report to Congress regarding such strategy. Makes specified funds available to carry out such activities. (Sec. 8) Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to direct the Administrator to: (1) establish career guidelines for Foreign Service and Civil Service personnel that incorporate interagency, intergovernmental, or international organization rotational assignments; (2) establish additional guidelines that consider participation by relevant officers in at least one interagency, intergovernmental, or international organizational rotational assignment of at least six months as a promotion factor into the ranks of the Senior Foreign Service or Senior Executive Service; (3) ensure that promotion precepts and panels do not penalize officers who have been assigned to interagency, intergovernmental, or international organizations; and (4) submit a related report to Congress. Directs the Administrator to: (1) establish procedures to ensure that appropriate language training for USAID Foreign Service Officers is provided before their overseas transfer; and (2) report to Congress regarding USAID efforts to facilitate external training, language training, and educational opportunities for Foreign Service and Civil Service personnel. (Sec. 9) Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to make the chief of each special mission responsible for the coordination of all U.S. government development and humanitarian efforts in a country. Directs the Administrator to report to Congress regarding modernizing USAID missions. (Sec. 10) Directs the President to require all federal departments and agencies to make publicly available on their web sites comprehensive and accessible information on U.S. foreign assistance on a program-by-program and country-by-country basis. Requires: (1) any organization or business that receives more than 50% of its funding from the U.S. government under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to submit a report to USAID that contains the names and all forms of compensation paid to its five most highly compensated employees; and (2) USAID to make such information publicly accessible on its web site. (Sec. 11) Authorizes the use of USAID program funds for: (1) travel expenses for Foreign Service or Civil Service personnel; (2) salaries and related expenses of employees other than Foreign Service or Civil Service employees who are U.S. citizens; and (3) research and policy analysis costs. Directs the Administrator to submit specified reports to Congress regarding such funds' management and accounting."
