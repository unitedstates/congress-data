Directs the Secretary of Energy to submit to the President and, if the President approves, to Congress, a plan for inclusion of such products in the SPR. Prohibits drawdown and sale of SPR petroleum products unless the Secretary determines that: (1) the drawdown and sale are required by a severe energy market supply interruption or U.S. obligations under the international energy program; or (2) a sale of refined petroleum products will mitigate the impacts of weather-related or other natural events that have resulted in a severe energy market disruption."
