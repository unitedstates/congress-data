Revises the Federal Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Credit Trading Programs by requiring the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to: (1) issue renewable energy credits equal to 100% of the electricity (or thermal energy expressed in an electricity-equivalent) displaced by qualifying renewable energy equipment; and (2) allocate such credits and credits for generators of electric energy produced through distributed generations facilities issued to the utility, project owner, and end user that paid for the purchase, installation, and maintenance of such equipment, on the basis of the cost incurred."
