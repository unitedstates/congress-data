Requires the payment of an annual \"cabin user fee\" by a \"cabin owner.\" Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to set such fee. Requires a reduction in the cabin use fee to $100 per year if access to a cabin is significantly impaired, whether by catastrophic events, natural causes or governmental actions, such that the cabin is rendered unsafe or unable to be occupied. Requires payment of a \"cabin transfer fee\" to the United States upon the transfer of a cabin between private parties for money or other consideration."
