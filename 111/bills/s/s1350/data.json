    "text": "Fueling America Act of 2009 - Directs the Secretary of Energy, in coordination with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to: (1) conduct a natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas vehicle research, development, and demonstration program; and (2) address the streamlining of manufacturer certification of natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas aftermarket conversion systems to comply with federal requirements and in-use emission standards. Requires the Administrator of General Services to study and report to Congress on whether the federal fleet should increase the number of its light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas vehicles. Amends the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) to increase from 50% to 65% of acquisition costs the federal matching grants for replacing school buses under the clean school bus program. Extends eligibility for such grants to clean school buses with: (1) engines manufactured in model years 2010-2014 that satisfy federal requirements for emissions of oxides of nitrogen and particulate matter; or (2) engines only fueled by compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or liquefied petroleum gas (including eligibility for a grant for an additional 25% of the acquisition costs of such school buses). Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the percentage rate of, and extend through calendar 2014, the tax credit for the purchase of natural gas vehicle refueling property and liquefied petroleum gas vehicle refueling property. Doubles the incremental cost limits for vehicles fueled by natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas in the formula for determining the new qualified alternative fuel motor vehicle credit."
