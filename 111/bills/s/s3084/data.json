(Sec. 7) Amends the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act to authorize the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in making awards for the creation and support of regional centers for the transfer of manufacturing technology, to consider whether an applicant has significant potential for enhancing the competitiveness of small and medium-sized U.S. manufacturers in the global marketplace, and to give a preference to applicants for such projects. Authorizes the Director, in making awards under the technology innovation program, to make the same consideration. (Sec. 8) Expresses the sense of the Senate that the Secretary should enhance federal collaboration with the states on export promotion issues.
