Requires the Secretary to ensure that there is competition. Allows the Secretary to: (1) establish a public-private partnership to design, construct, own, and operate such a facility; and (2) use the authority to enter into other transactions under the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to establish such a facility."
