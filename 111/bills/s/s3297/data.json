    "text": "Zimbabwe Transition to Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2010 - (Sec. 5) Authorizes the President to provide technical assistance to ministries of the transitional government of Zimbabwe and to the Parliament of Zimbabwe for economic, political, and security sector reforms. Terminates such authority on September 30, 2014. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the transitional government of Zimbabwe should work to enact the economic, political, and security sector reforms envisaged under the Global Political Agreement; and (2) the United States should continue to provide technical assistance to build the capacity of ministries and offices within the transitional government of Zimbabwe that demonstrate a commitment to those reforms. (Sec. 6) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the absence of respect for property rights in Zimbabwe continues to hinder agricultural productivity and economic recovery; and (2) the United States should support efforts to conduct a comprehensive and nonpartisan land audit as a critical step toward establishing security of tenure. Expresses the sense of Congress that U.S. assistance to Zimbabwe should: (1) support market-based agricultural credit mechanisms; (2) encourage policies that provide agricultural incentives; and (3) support institutions that provide technical and financial support for the agriculture sector. (Sec. 7) Amends the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 to revise the criteria under which the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct U.S. executive directors at international financial institutions to oppose extensions of loans, credits, or guarantees to the government of Zimbabwe. (Sec. 8) Amends the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 2010 to revise criteria for U.S. assistance to Zimbabwe. (Sec. 9) Expresses the sense of Congress that until the Secretary of State can certify Zimbabwe's full compliance with the Kimberley Process the President should: (1) press for Zimbabwe's suspension from the Kimberley Process diamond certification scheme; (2) work with Zimbabwe's neighbors as well as with regional organizations to help stop the flow of illegal diamonds mined in Zimbabwe; and (3) seek to identify and prepare sanctions on individuals and entities funding efforts to undermine democratic institutions in Zimbabwe through illegal activities involving diamonds. (Sec. 10) Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the Treasury should regularly review and update targeted sanctions related to Zimbabwe. (Sec. 11) Expresses the sense of Congress that the U.S. government should begin engaging with international partners and regional governments to develop a coordinated strategy to prepare for future elections in Zimbabwe, particularly to help reduce the risk of violence and other related abuses. (Sec. 12) Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to brief the appropriate congressional committees on efforts made pursuant to this Act."
