Authorizes the Secretary to carry out certain public transportation safety program activities, including inspection and testing of public transportation systems and accident prevention and investigation. Allows a state to establish a state public transportation safety program that complies with federal regulations and policies issued by the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants or enter into agreements to carry out such state programs, including to: (1) train employees to administer the program; and (2) enforce federal and state public transportation safety laws and regulations. Grants the Secretary enforcement authority for violations of public transportation safety, including alcohol and controlled substances testing.
