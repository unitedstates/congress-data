Amends the Controlled Substances Act to: (1) set forth training requirements for health care practitioners registered to prescribe or dispense methadone or other opioids; and (2) require opioid treatment clinics to make acceptable arrangements for the distribution of methadone to patients restricted from taking home doses when the clinic is closed. Prohibits the writing of prescriptions or dispensing of a 40-mg diskette of methadone unless such prescription or dispensation is consistent with current Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) methadone policy."
