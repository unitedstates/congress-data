Amends the Social Security Act to provide: (1) Medicare and Medicaid coverage for vaccines recommended for routine use; and (2) reimbursement to health care providers for administering vaccines to children under the Vaccines for Children program. Requires the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the CDC Director to jointly review and update the regional maximum charge for state vaccine administration established under the Vaccines for Children program."
