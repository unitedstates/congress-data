Requires eligible programs to be implemented in active collaboration with the schools the students attend and take place in safe and easily accessible facilities. Gives priority to applicants that are partnerships between eligible entities or propose to serve students a majority of whom are eligible for free or reduced price meals under the school lunch and breakfast programs."
