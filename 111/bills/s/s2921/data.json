    "text": "California Desert Protection Act of 2010 - Amends the California Desert Protection Act of 1994 to, among other things: (1) establish or designate national monuments, wilderness areas, a special management area, and off-highway vehicle recreation areas; (2) release specified wilderness study areas; (3) adjust national park and preserve boundaries; and (4) specify land withdrawals, exchanges, and acquisitions. Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate specified segments of rivers and creeks as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to direct the Secretary of the Interior to designate Renewable Energy Coordination Offices (the Offices) in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Nevada, Montana, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming for the coordination of federal permits for renewable energy projects and transmission lines to integrate renewable energy development. Establishes a process and procedures (including deadlines) for consideration of right-of-way use authorizations applications for the construction of wind and solar electricity generation facilities. Requires programmatic environmental impact statements analyzing the impacts of the development of solar, biomass, wind, geothermal energy, and associated electric transmission capacity on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands, National Forest System lands, and on military installations in the Mojave and Colorado Deserts in Arizona, California, and Nevada. Requires a study analyzing the impacts of a program to develop large-scale renewable electricity generation projects on military installations in the Mojave and Colorado Deserts in California and Nevada. Establishes the California Desert Mitigation Bank Pilot Program under which eligible lands in the California Desert Conservation Area shall be made available as habitat mitigation zones to serve as mitigation for the development of renewable energy projects on non-federal land. Requires a report on the Offices and renewable energy permitting policies and processes in the western states. Authorizes grants for the development, construction, and acquisition of advanced electric transmission properties."
