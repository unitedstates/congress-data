    "text": "Broadband Program Reauthorization Act of 2010 - Amends provisions of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 concerning access to broadband telecommunications services in rural areas to authorize appropriations to cover the costs of grants, loans, and loan guarantees for broadband infrastructure in any area of the United States. Gives priority in making such grants, loans, and loan guarantees to projects that provide service to the highest proportion of rural residents that do not have access to broadband service and to project applications that will expand broadband opportunities in rural and tribal areas. Permits, under the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program, entities that have received waiver authority from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to use the 763-768/793-798 MHz (700 MHz) public safety broadband spectrum to apply for funding. Authorizes appropriations for such Program. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) repeal the expensing and 60-month amortization of intangible drilling costs; (2) repeal percentage depletion for oil and gas properties; and (3) deny the deduction for income attributable to the domestic production of oil, natural gas, or its primary products."
