    "text": "Small Business Administration Disaster Recovery and Reform Act of 2009 - Amends the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 to direct the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to submit to the congressional small business committees recommendations for improvements to the Gulf Coast disaster loan refinancing program. Extends for 24 additional months the authorized loan assistance term for small businesses affected by Hurricanes Katrina or Rita and participating in the SBA small business and capital ownership development program. Allows the Administrator to declare a disaster with respect to small businesses that installed defective drywall manufactured in China, for purposes of qualification for SBA disaster loan assistance. Amends the Small Business Act to increase authorized assistance under the SBA's: (1) pioneer business recovery program (formerly the expedited disaster assistance loan program); and (2) disaster loan assistance program. Authorizes the Administrator to guarantee loans made under an approved state bridge loan program. Requires the Administrator to report on: (1) regional outreach on disaster assistance programs; (2) coordination of economic injury disaster declarations; and (3) coordination between SBA and Department of Agriculture (USDA) disaster programs. Directs the Administrator to ensure that disaster recovery needs unmet by federal and private sources are not overlooked by the SBA in determining duplication of benefits for disaster victims."
