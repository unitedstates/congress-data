Authorizes the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to make grants to organizations for reduced cost mental health services or counseling to public safety officers seriously injured in the line of duty and their families. Requires the Director to structure, design, and implement a performance measure for the Public Safety Officers Benefits program to monitor the claims process and payment of benefits to public safety officers and their beneficiaries and to report to Congress annually on the performance of the program and its activities."
