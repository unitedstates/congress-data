Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to issue an order to: (1) subject domestic citrus producers to the requirements of this Act; and (2) establish a Citrus Research and Development Board. Authorizes the Secretary to provide grants to the Board to develop a coordinated program of research and product development relating to: (1) scientific research of both domestic and invasive diseases and pests afflicting the citrus industry; and (2) support for the dissemination and commercialization of relevant information, techniques, and technologies discovered through Fund research or other research projects intended to solve problems caused by citrus production diseases and invasive pests. Requires the President to notify certain congressional committees before entering into a trade agreement that could result in a decrease in the amount of: (1) duties paid on imported citrus and citrus products; and (2) funds transferred into the Fund."
