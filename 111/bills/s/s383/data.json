Limits such allowance to: (1) not more than 25 employees at any time as designated by the SIG; and (2) only pay periods beginning after the enactment of this Act.(Sec. 4) Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to either: (1) take action to address deficiencies identified by a report or investigation of the SIG or other auditor engaged by the TARP; or (2) certify to congressional committees that no action is necessary or appropriate.Instructs the SIG to work with Inspectors General of designated federal agencies to: (1) avoid duplication of effort; and (2) ensure comprehensive oversight of TARP.Makes the SIG a member of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency until termination of the Office.(Sec. 5) Requires the SIG to: (1) report quarterly to certain congressional committees on SIG activities; (2) report to Congress by September 1, 2009, on the use of any funds received by a financial institution under TARP; and (3) make the latter report available to the public, including on the home page of the SIG's website within 24 hours after its submission to Congress.(Sec. 6) Requires funding for the office of the SIG to be made available not later than seven days after the date of enactment of this Act. (Sec. 7) Makes the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction and the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction members of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency until the termination of their respective Offices."
