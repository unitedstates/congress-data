Requires: (1) the board to meet at least four times a year with a quorum of at least five members; and (2) board minutes be made public. Requires the advisory committee to the PBGC to meet jointly with the board at least one time each year. Requires the Director and members of the board of the PBGC to agree in writing to recuse themselves from participation in activities which potentially could be a conflict of interest. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the board should form committees, including an audit committee and an investment committee, to enhance the PBGC board's overall effectiveness; and (2) the PBGC should establish a risk management position that evaluates and mitigates risk it might experience."
