Counts as reimbursable costs over that period: (1) the costs of acquiring all parts and inventory in the dealer's possession on the same basis as if the dealer were terminating pursuant to an existing franchise or dealer agreement; and (2) all other obligations owed by the automobile manufacturer or its distributor pursuant to an agreement with the dealer. Requires such dealer reimbursement terms to be included in the wording of agreements between such manufacturers or their distributors and the federal government, and in the terms of credit agreements approved by bankruptcy courts. Prohibits the rejection of franchise or dealer agreements by automobile manufacturers or their distributors that are debtors in a bankruptcy proceeding from becoming effective until at least 180 days after approval by a bankruptcy court."
