States that: (1) An official of the Russian Federation shall be eligible for such privileges and immunities only if the official has been invited by the U.S. government after December 5, 2009, to perform an inspection or continuous monitoring activity within U.S. territory consistent with Protocol procedures; (2) such privileges and immunities shall be accorded only to perform official inspection or monitoring activities and not for personal benefit; (3) such privileges and immunities may be accorded for the entire time the official is in U.S. territory and thereafter with respect to acts previously performed in the exercise of official functions; and (4) such official shall respect U.S. laws and regulations, not interfere in internal U.S. affairs, and not engage in any professional or commercial activity for personal profit. Terminates such authority on the earlier of June 5, 2010, or on the date of the entry into force of a U.S.-Russian agreement that supersedes the Protocol."
