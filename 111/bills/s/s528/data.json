    "text": "Caging Prohibition Act of 2009 - Prohibits state or local election officials from preventing an individual from registering or voting (including by provisional ballot) in any election for federal office, or permitting a formal challenge under state law to an individual's registration status or eligibility to vote in a federal election, if the sole basis for such decision or challenge is evidence consisting of: (1) a voter caging document or voter caging list; (2) an unverified match list; (3) the foreclosure status of the individual's residence; or (4) certain information indicating a change of residence. Defines \"voter caging document\" as: (1) any nonforwardable document that is sent to an individual at the address at which such individual is registered (or seeking to become registered) as a voter in a federal election, and that is returned to the sender or to a third party as undelivered or undeliverable; and (2) any document (other than a notice warning of possible removal from the voting rolls) sent to an individual at the address at which such individual is registered containing instructions to return the document to the sender or a third party, but is not so returned. Defines \"unverified match list\" as one produced by: (1) matching the identity of registered voters or voter registration applicants with the identity of individuals who are ineligible to vote in the registrar's jurisdiction, by virtue of death, conviction, change of address, mental impairment, or otherwise, unless the process for matching the identities establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the identities belong to the same individual; or (2) failing to match the identity of registered voters or voter registration applicants with the identity of individuals listed in the database of the state motor vehicle authority or in information provided by the Commissioner of Social Security under a verification agreement. Outlines requirements for challenges to an individual's registration or voting eligibility by persons other than election officials."
