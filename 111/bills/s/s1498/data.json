Sets forth certain exceptions to such limits. Requires authorizations of appropriations for FY2010 and the period from October 1, 2010, through March 31, 2011, to be allocated to a state for certain federal-aid highway programs in the same proportion as the amount apportioned to the state for that program for FY2009 bears to amounts apportioned to the state for FY2009 for all programs. Authorizes appropriations out of the HTF (other than the Mass Transit Account) for administrative expenses of the federal-aid highway program for FY2010 and the period from October 1, 2010, through March 31, 2011."
