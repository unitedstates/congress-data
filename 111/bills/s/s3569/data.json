Sets forth required elements of the review, including reviews of technological capabilities relevant to identifying releases of oil or natural gas after a spill and recommendations for long-term monitoring and assessment. Requires the Under Secretary, not later than one year after enactment of this Act, to establish a hydrocarbon monitoring and assessment program based on the recommendations developed under the comprehensive review. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer to the Secretary of Commerce, out of any funds in the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund not otherwise appropriated, $15 million to carry out this Act."
