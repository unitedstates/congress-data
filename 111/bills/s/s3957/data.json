Requires bonus payments to a hospital if at least 33% of its full-time equivalent residents were enrolled in medical residency programs in primary care during the applicable period. Directs the Secretary to establish a program of payments to eligible hospitals for direct and indirect expenses associated with operating graduate medical residency training programs. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress and the National Health Care Workforce Commission on the graduate medical education (GME) payments that hospitals receive under the Medicare program. Establishes in the Treasury the Medical Education Trust Fund. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the fees on insured and self-insured health plans to provide partial financing for the Trust Fund."
