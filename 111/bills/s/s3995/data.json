Authorizes the executive agency controlling a federal government building to grant an easement or rights-of-way, for the installation, construction, and maintenance of wireless transmitters and backhaul transmission, to an executive agency, state, or individual applicant. Requires the Administrator to establish a fee for awarding such easement or rights-of-way that is based on fair market prices, subject to certain exceptions. Requires any fees collected to be used by the relevant agency for construction and maintenance of Wi-Fi hotspots and wireless neutral host systems. Directs the Administrator to develop one or more master contracts to govern the placement of wireless transmitters on federal government buildings."
