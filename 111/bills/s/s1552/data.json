Prescribes requirements for schools participating in such grant programs, including administering nationally norm-referenced standardized tests in reading and mathematics to participating students. Repeals the DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003 (title III of division C of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004). Deems this Act as the reauthorization of the opportunity scholarship program under such Act."
