    "text": "Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Reauthorization Act of 2009 - Title I: Findings and Declaration of Purpose - (Sec. 102) Adds as a purpose of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (JJDPA) the support of a continuum of programs (including delinquency prevention, intervention, mental health and substance abuse treatment, and aftercare programs) to address the needs of at-risk youth and youth who come into contact with the justice system. (Sec. 103) Adds and amends definitions under JJDPA. Defines \"core requirements\" as certain requirements relating to the protection of juveniles against placement in adult prison facilities and the treatment of juveniles equitably on the basis of gender, race, family income, and disability. Defines \"evidence based\" as a program or practice that is demonstrated to be effective and that: (1) is based on a clearly articulated and empirically supported theory, (2) has measurable outcomes, and (3) has been scientifically tested. Title II: Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention - (Sec. 201) Extends until July 2, 2010, the date on which the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention must revise and publish the annual plan for coordinating federal juvenile justice efforts. (Sec. 202) Revises and increases the membership of the Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to include mental health professionals. Requires the Council to report to Congress on its recommendations for coordinating federal juvenile delinquency programs and to publish such report on the websites of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Council. (Sec. 203) Adds elements required for the Administrator's annual report, including: (1) data on the confinement and release of juveniles from custody and on status offenders (juveniles arrested for offenses that would not be criminal if committed by adults), (2) the number of pregnant juveniles in custody, (3) a description of the criteria used to determine what JJDPA programs qualify as evidence-based and promising programs, (4) a comprehensive list of those programs the Administrator has determined meet such criteria, (5) a description of funding provided to Indian tribes, and (6) an analysis and evaluation of compliance by and payments to grant recipients. (Sec. 204) Increases the allocation of funds for technical assistance to states under JJDPA. Requires allocations of funds under the Act to be based upon the most recent census data. Authorizes the reallocation of funds withheld from states due to noncompliance with core requirements into improvement grants for assisting states in achieving compliance with such requirements. Requires the Administrator to impose conditions for awarding grants based upon compliance with such requirements and to provide technical assistance to states for achieving compliance. (Sec. 205) Requires states to post their juvenile delinquency prevention plans on a publicly available website within 30 days of final approval. Revises membership requirements for state juvenile delinquency prevention advisory groups to include volunteers who work with youth of color. Requires such advisory groups to use grant funds to: (1) provide training and technical assistance to state and local agencies for juvenile delinquency prevention activities, and (2) expand access to court-appointed legal counsel for representation of juveniles. Revises requirements for state juvenile delinquency prevention plans to: (1) promote compliance with core requirements; (2) provide alternatives to secure detention for juveniles; (3) reduce the number of juveniles placed in secure detention and adult corrections facilities; (4) engage family members in the design and delivery of juvenile delinquency prevention and treatment services; (5) provide for the use of community-based services to address the needs of at-risk youth; (6) provide for the sharing of records by juvenile justice and child welfare agencies for abused and neglected youth; (7) address mental health and substance abuse screening, assessment, referral, and treatment for juveniles in the juvenile justice system; (8) provide for expanded access to court-appointed counsel for juveniles in the juvenile justice system; and (9) require that juveniles awaiting trial as adults not have sight and sound contact with adult inmates. Requires the Administrator to: (1) make determinations as to whether states are in compliance with core requirements, and (2) provide technical assistance to state advisory groups. Modifies provisions relating to the detention of juveniles awaiting trial in adult criminal court to require placement in a juvenile facility unless a judge determines that it is in the interest of justice for a juvenile to be held in an adult facility. Prohibits the detention of a juvenile in an adult facility or sight and sound contact by such juvenile with adult inmates for more than 180 days unless the court determines in writing that there is good cause for further detention or the juvenile waives this limitation. Sets forth additional criteria for identifying and reducing racial and ethnic disparities among youth in the juvenile justice system. Modifies requirements for the detention of status offenders to prohibit placement of such juveniles in secure detention unless it is deemed in their best interest. Expands procedural requirements relating to reentry services for juveniles to require: (1) written case plans for each juvenile, (2) a description of living arrangements after discharge and post-release services, and (3) court review of such reentry plans and services. Permits the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to take punitive action in the current fiscal year against states that fail to comply with a core requirement (current law provides for such punitive action in a subsequent fiscal year). Requires states that are found to be out of compliance with core requirements to submit a report to the Administrator detailing the reasons for noncompliance and a plan to regain compliance. Requires such report to be posted on a publicly available website.
