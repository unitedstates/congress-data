Directs the Secretary of Labor to provide rules setting forth the form and manner in which prompt notice to individuals of such continued coverage shall be made. Allows a state to enforce the provisions of this Act with respect to COBRA continuation coverage provided under a state program. Provides that this Act has no effect on termination of continuation coverage for any reason other than expiration of a period of a specified number of months."
