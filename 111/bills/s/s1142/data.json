Defines \"comparative clinical effectiveness\" as the clinical outcomes, effectiveness, safety, and clinical appropriateness of a drug or device in comparison to one or more drugs or devices approved to prevent, diagnose, or treat the same health condition in the same patient demographic subpopulation. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require information on comparative clinical effectiveness for drugs and devices in labeling and advertising."
