    "text": "Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2009 - Prohibits the issuance of a federal patent for any mining claim, millsite, or tunnel site (claim or site) unless the Secretary of the Interior determines that: (1) a patent application was filed by September 30, 1994; and (2) all application requirements were fully complied with by such date. Prescribes a mandatory claim maintenance fee and location fee for each claim or site. States that failure to perform assessment work, pay a mandatory maintenance or location fee, or file timely notice of location shall: (1) conclusively constitute forfeiture; and (2) make the claim or site null and void.

Authorizes the Secretary to grant royalty relief. Directs the Secretary to establish a comprehensive inspection, collection, fiscal, and production accounting and auditing system to: (1) determine accurately any royalties, interest, fines, penalties, fees, deposits, and other payments owed; and (2) collect and account for such payments in a timely manner. Requires a permit to engage in the following activities on federal land: (1) mineral activities that would disturb surface resources, including land, air, water, and fish and wildlife; and (2) exploration and mineral activities that involve more than casual use of the land. Prescribes requirements for mining permits. Requires an operator to give the Secretary specified financial assurances before beginning any mineral activities requiring an exploration or mining permit in order to ensure reclamation and restoration of any land or water adversely affected by the activities. Establishes the Hardrock Minerals Reclamation Fund for the reclamation and restoration of land and water resources adversely affected by past hardrock minerals and mining and related activities in abandoned hardrock mine states, and on Indian land located within the exterior boundaries of abandoned hardrock mine states.
