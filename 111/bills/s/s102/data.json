Makes it out of order in the Senate to consider a bill, amendment, resolution, or conference report containing any provision that adjusts the pay of Members of Congress, unless that provision has been subject to a roll call in the Senate. Permits waiver or suspension of such requirements, or successful appeals from rulings of the Chair, only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths (60) of the Senate."
