Allows the addition as officers of any others specified in the Association's constitution (currently, as decided at the national convention). Declares that the officers shall take office at the national convention. Requires the judge advocate to be appointed by the national executive committee. Allows for appointment by the national executive committee of any other national officers specified in the Association's constitution. Revises the requirement that minutes be kept of the proceedings of the national council.
