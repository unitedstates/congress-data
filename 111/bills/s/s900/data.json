Specifies a point structure for rating credit cards. Assigns an automatic one-star rating (the lowest level of safety) to any open end credit plan that allows the card issuer to modify the terms of the agreement with a cardholder at any time or periodically for unspecified or unstated reasons. Establishes the Credit Card Safety Star Advisory Commission."
