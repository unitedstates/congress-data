Defines \"qualified used energy storage property\" as property comprised of pre-owned advanced large format automotive propulsion battery cells previously used in a qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicle which are reconditioned into: (1) property that is designed to receive and store electrical energy, convert it to electricity, and to deliver such electricity for support to the transmission or distribution grid or for sale to unrelated parties and that has the ability to store 50 kilowatt hours of energy or to attain a peak power output of 20 kilowatts; or (2) property that is primarily designed and used to receive and store intermittent renewable energy generated on-site and to deliver such energy for primarily on-site consumption, or which provides supplemental energy to reduce peak energy requirements on-site, and that has the ability to store the energy equivalent of 20 kilowatt hours of energy and to maintain an output of the energy equivalent of 5 kilowatt hours of electricity for 4 hours. ."
