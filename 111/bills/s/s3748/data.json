    "text": "National Guard and Reserve Soft Landing Reintegration Act - Requires that a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces who was deployed for more than 269 days for a contingency operation or a homeland defense mission be: (1) retained on active duty in the Armed Forces for 45 days after the end of the member's demobilization from a deployment; (2) allowed to use accrued leave; and (3) paid specified pay and allowances. Requires a member requesting an early release from such active duty to be released within 14 days after such request. Allows such request to be denied only for medical or personal safety reasons. Directs the Secretary of the military department concerned to provide each member so retained (and, as practicable, appropriate family members) reintegration counseling and services. Provides FY2011 funding for costs of such additional active-duty retention."
