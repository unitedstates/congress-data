Prohibits any expenditure of TARP funds until the Secretary transfers all voting, nonvoting, and common equity in any designated TARP recipient to a limited liability company, to be held and managed in trust on behalf of U.S. taxpayers. Requires the trustees to liquidate the trust and its assets by December 24, 2011, unless: (1) the trustees report to Congress that liquidation would not maximize profitability of the company and the return on investment to the taxpayer; and (2) Congress enacts into law a joint resolution disapproving the liquidation plan of the Secretary."
