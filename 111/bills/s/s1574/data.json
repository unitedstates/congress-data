Establishes in the Department of Energy (DOE) the Clean Energy for Homes and Buildings Program. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish eligibility criteria for applicants for financial assistance (including credit enhancements, debt instruments, or other financial products); and (2) select a portfolio of investments that reaches a diversity of building owners. Authorizes the Secretary to provide financial assistance to eligible applicants to promote the widespread deployment of, and mobilize private sector support of credit and investment institutions for, energy efficiency measures and on-site renewable energy generation systems in buildings."
