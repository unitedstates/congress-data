    "text": "Veterans Health Care Authorization Act of 2009 - Title I: Department Personnel Matters - (Sec. 101) Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to appoint personnel for health care positions within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) not specifically listed in authorized classes for appointment, as long as the Secretary provides prior notification to the congressional veterans committees and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Requires the Secretary, before submitting notification, to solicit comments from any labor organization representing employees in any such class and include such comments in such notification. Authorizes the appointment of nurse assistants within the VHA. Makes the probationary period after appointment as a registered nurse two years. Provides that an appointment on a part-time basis of a VHA health care professional who has previously served on a full-time basis shall be without a probationary period. Limits to two years the probationary period for the appointment of a registered nurse on a temporary, part-time basis, after which time the appointment shall be considered permanent. Provides an exception with respect to appointments made on a term-limited basis of three years or less. Authorizes the Secretary to waive, on a case-by-case basis, the application of salary offsets for VHA retirees reemployed in the VHA. Bases the rate of basic pay for appointees to the Office of the Under Secretary for Health on pay levels in the Senior Executive Service for equivalent positions. Allows for the payment of special incentive pay of up to $40,000 annually for a VHA pharmacist executive. Removes, adjusts, or waives certain pay restrictions, including on the non-foreign cost-of-living adjustment, market pay, and basic and locality pay, for VHA: (1) physicians and dentists; (2) physicians or dentists occupying administrative or executive leadership positions; (3) nurses; and (4) certified registered nurse anesthetists. Requires additional training, education, and support for appropriate VHA employees in the conduct and use of locality pay scale surveys. Requires VHA facility wage-related information, currently provided by way of reports from facility directors to the Secretary, to be made available, upon request, to individuals in VHA positions covered by such report. Increases from $25,000 to $100,000 the special pay for nurse executives. Makes part-time nurses eligible for additional premium nurse pay.

Adds licensed practical nurses, licensed vocational nurses, and certain other nurse positions to those positions exempted from limitations on increases in basic pay rates. (Sec. 102) Prohibits: (1) the Secretary from requiring nursing staff to work more than 40 hours in a week or eight hours in a day (12 hours in the case of three-day workweeks), except under non-recurring emergency circumstances; and (2) discrimination or adverse personnel actions against nurse staff who refuse to work such additional hours. Revises the calculation of leave for nurses working two 12-hour shifts on a weekend.

Requires: (1) applicants to provide certain information, including each lawsuit, civil action, or other claim against the individual for medical malpractice or negligence, and the results thereof; (2) each appointee to disclose any judgments against the individual for medical malpractice or negligence and any payments made; (3) physicians already employed within the VHA to disclose such information; and (4) the Veterans Integrated Services Network (Network) director in the region in which the physician seeks employment to investigate the information disclosed by such physician. Prohibits a new appointment without the approval of the appropriate Network regional director.

Title IV: Mental Health Care Matters - (Sec. 401) Makes any member who serves in Operations Iraqi Freedom or Enduring Freedom eligible for readjustment counseling and related mental health services through Vet Centers (centers for readjustment counseling and related mental health services for veterans), regardless of whether the member is on active duty at the time of receipt of such counseling and services. (Sec. 402) Directs the Secretary, upon receipt of a request for counseling from an individual who has been discharged or released from active service, to: (1) provide referrals to assist the individual in obtaining mental health care and services outside the VA; and (2) if pertinent, advise such individual of the right to apply for review of the discharge or release.
