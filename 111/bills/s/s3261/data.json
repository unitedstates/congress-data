Requires the federal cost share of any activity carried out using assistance under this Act to be half of that activity's cost. Sets forth requirements for the approval or disapproval of the management plan by the Secretary of the Interior. Specifies this Act's effect on private property protections and water rights with regard to the Heritage Area. Bars anything in this Act from being meant as modifying the Rio Grande Natural Area Act."
