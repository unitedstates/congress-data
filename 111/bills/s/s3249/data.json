Authorizes appropriations for the program for FY2011-FY2015. Repeals the program termination date. Prohibits funds appropriated or otherwise made available to carry out such program from being used for congressionally directed spending. Requires the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to report to Congress explaining the reasons for awarding any grants using procedures other than competitive procedures."
