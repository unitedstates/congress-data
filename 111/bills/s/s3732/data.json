Allows secondary schools to apply for such grants if their LEA does not. Gives priority to grant applications that address the needs of: (1) rural or urban schools; (2) low-performing schools or school districts; or (3) LEAs or schools that serve at least 10,000 poor children or a student population at least 20% of which is poor. Authorizes the Secretary to waive all or part of the matching requirement for financially-strapped LEAs or schools. Directs the Secretary to: (1) publicize the grant program and nontraditional STEM teaching methods; and (2) evaluate the efficacy of the grant program."
