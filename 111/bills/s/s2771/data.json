Sets forth a maximum penalty for failure to report a reportable transaction and a minimum and maximum penalty for failure to report a listed transaction (a transaction specifically identified by the IRS as a tax avoidance transaction). Requires the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to report by June 1, 2010, and then annually, to Congress on penalties relating to tax shelters and reportable transactions."
