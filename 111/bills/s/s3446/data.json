    "text": "Child Nutrition Enhancement Act of 2010 - Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to replace the team nutrition network program with the wellness and nutrition network (TWNN) program: a nationwide, multidisciplinary program that promotes healthy eating and physical activity by children and is funded and overseen at the federal level, administered at the state level, and implemented at the local level. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to develop and carry out a comprehensive, integrated national strategy that coordinates federal, state, and local efforts to promote and support healthy eating, physical activity, and positive behavioral changes. Requires the Secretary to provide grants to states to: (1) establish a comprehensive, integrated, and coordinated wellness and nutrition network in their state; and (2) allocate funding to local educational agencies (LEAs) and other institutions providing services under the child nutrition programs to support child nutrition promotion and education. Requires LEAs and other institutions to use such funds to: (1) implement, assess, or strengthen a local wellness policy established under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act; (2) improve the nutritional quality of meals and snacks served through the child nutrition programs; (3) increase children's acceptance of nutritious meals and snacks; (4) implement federal, state, or other health guidelines; (5) provide children with regular physical activity; or (6) work with public and private organizations to promote and support healthy eating and physical activity."
