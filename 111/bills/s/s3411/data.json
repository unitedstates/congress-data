Deems such an alien to satisfy the requirements applicable to adopted children if, before the alien is 18 years of age, he or she adjusts to permanent resident status and is adopted by a U.S. citizen (which may occur before, on, or after status adjustment). Permits a parent or legal guardian to apply on behalf of a minor. Prohibits any derivative immigration benefits for the birth parent of an alien adjusted under this Act."
