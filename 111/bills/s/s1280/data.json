Prohibits any expenditure of funds under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) until the Secretary transfers all voting, nonvoting, and common equity in any designated TARP recipient to a limited liability company, to be held and managed in trust on behalf of U.S. taxpayers. Requires the trustees to liquidate the trust, including the assets it holds, by December 24, 2011, unless the trustees report to Congress that liquidation would not maximize profitability of the company and the return on investment to the taxpayer."
