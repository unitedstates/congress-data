Defines such an initiative as a program that increases economic development by improving the environment and that may include: (1) revitalizing municipal parks and public spaces; (2) landscaping community gateways and key corridors; (3) tree plantings and urban forestry projects; (4) comprehensive planning for open space preservation; (5) education, training, and volunteer management concerning community green initiatives; (6) green roof construction; (7) green stormwater infrastructure; and (8) vacant lot management. Defines an \"eligible municipality\" as a municipality that meets criteria for an economic adjustment grant under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965. Directs the Secretary to select 80 eligible municipalities to receive grants. Requires an eligible municipality seeking a grant to agree to make available nonfederal funds to carry out the initiative in an amount equal to not less than 50% of the grant awarded. Directs the Secretary to make grants to, or enter into contracts with, five nonprofit organizations to provide technical assistance and training to municipalities receiving grants."
