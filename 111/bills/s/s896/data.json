    "text": "Division A: Preventing Mortgage Foreclosures - Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 - Title I: Prevention of Mortgage Foreclosures - (Sec. 101) Amends the Housing Act of 1949 with respect to guaranteed rural housing loans to require mortgagees, upon either actual or imminent default of a guaranteed mortgage, to engage in loss mitigation actions as an alternative to foreclosure (including special forbearance, loan modification, pre-foreclosure sale, deed in lieu of foreclosure, support for borrower housing counseling, subordinate lien resolution, and borrower relocation). Permits the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) (Secretary for purposes of this section), for mortgages either in default or facing imminent default, to: (1) authorize the modification of such mortgages; and (2) establish a program for payment of a partial claim to a mortgagee who agrees to apply the claim amount to payment of a mortgage on a 1- to 4-family residence. Permits the Secretary to: (1) authorize compensation to the mortgagee for lost income on monthly mortgage payments due to interest rate reduction; (2) reimburse the mortgagee from a guaranty fund in connection with activities that the mortgagee is required to undertake concerning repayment by the mortgagor of the amount owed to HUD; (3) authorize payments to the mortgagee on behalf of the borrower, under terms defined by HUD; and (4) authorize mortgage modification with terms extended up to 40 years from the modification date. Grants the Secretary authority, upon mortgagee request, to establish a program for assignment to HUD of a guaranteed mortgage on a 1- to 4-family residence in or facing imminent default. Prescribes procedures for HUD payment of guarantee, disposition, and loan servicing. Requires the mortgagee already to have modified the mortgage, or to have qualified it for modification sufficient to cure the default and provide for mortgage payments the mortgagor is reasonably able to pay, at interest rates not exceeding current market rates. Authorizes the Secretary to pay the mortgage guaranty, without reduction for any amounts modified, but only upon the assignment, transfer, and delivery to the Secretary of all rights, interest, claims, evidence, and records with respect to the mortgage. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) reassign the mortgage to the mortgagee; (2) act as a Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA, or Ginnie Mae) issuer, or contract with an entity for such purpose, in order to pool the mortgage into a Ginnie Mae security; or (3) resell the mortgage in accordance with any program established for purchase by the federal government of insured mortgages. (Sec. 102) Revises the requirement that the maturity of any housing loan guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) not be more than 30 years and 32 days. Specifies the maturity of a housing loan at the time of origination. (Sec. 103) Authorizes additional appropriations for FY2010-FY2011 to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for: (1) advertising to increase public awareness of mortgage scams and counseling assistance; (2) the Housing Counseling Assistance Program; and (3) personnel at the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. (Sec. 104) Requires the Comptroller of the Currency and the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) to report jointly to certain congressional committees on the volume of mortgage modifications reported to their agencies. (Sec. 105) Amends the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008, with respect to emergency assistance for the redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes (neighborhood stabilization), to authorize each state that has received certain minimum allocations and has fulfilled certain requirements, to distribute any remaining amounts to areas with homeowners at risk of foreclosure or in foreclosure without regard to the percentage of home foreclosures in such areas. Title II: Foreclosure Mitigation and Credit Availability - (Sec. 201) Amends the the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) to modify the fiduciary duty requirements of servicers of pooled residential mortgages as duty requirements for any servicer of residential mortgages that agrees to enter into a qualified loss mitigation plan for residential mortgages originated before the date of enactment of this Act (including mortgages held in a securitization or other investment vehicle). Shields from liability to any party owed a specified duty (as under existing law) a servicer who is deemed to be acting in the best interests of all investors and other parties. States that such a servicer shall not be subject to any equitable relief to such a party that is based solely upon implementation by the servicer of a qualified loss mitigation plan.
