Authorizes a temporary increase, through calendar 2010, in such borrowing authority, up to a maximum of $500 billion, if the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the President, determines that additional amounts above $100 billion are necessary, pursuant to the written recommendation of the FDIC Board of Directors and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board). Requires a two-thirds vote of the members of both the FDIC Board of Directors and the Federal Reserve Board to make such a recommendation. Requires the FDIC, if its borrowing authority is increased above $100 billion, to report promptly to certain congressional committees the reasons and need for the additional borrowing authority and its intended uses."
