Requires plan updates every 90 days. Directs the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction to: (1) issue recommendations for increasing oversight of contractors in Afghanistan that have a record of engaging in waste, fraud, or abuse; and (2) report on the status of efforts of the Department of Defense (DOD) and the State Department to implement existing recommendations regarding oversight of such contractors. Requires the recommendations issued to include recommendations for reducing U.S. reliance on security contractors or subcontractors responsible for the deaths of Afghan civilians and on Afghan militias, contractors, subcontractors, or other armed groups that are not part of the Afghan National Security Forces."
