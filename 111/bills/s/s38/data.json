    "as": "Reported to Senate without amendment", 
    "date": "2010-03-04", 
    "text": "Professional Boxing Amendments Act of 2009 - (Sec. 3) Amends the Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996 to: (1) authorize a tribal organization to establish a boxing commission to regulate professional boxing matches held on Indian land; and (2) provide that its provisions shall apply to professional boxing matches held on tribal lands to the same extent and in the same way as they apply to such matches held in any state. Requires health and safety standards and licensing requirements for matches to be at least as restrictive as: (1) standards and requirements in the state in which the Indian land is located; or (2) the guidelines established by the United States Boxing Commission (USBC) (established in this Act). (Sec. 5) Prohibits any person from arranging, promoting, organizing, producing, or fighting in a match within the United States unless the match is: (1) approved by the USBC; and (2) held in a state or on tribal land that regulates professional boxing matches in accordance with standards and criteria established by the USBC. (Sec. 6) Repeals provisions allowing the use of alternative requirements for the protection of the health and safety of boxers during matches. Requires: (1) pre-fight boxer physical examinations to include testing for infectious diseases; and (2) continuous on-site presence during any match of an ambulance and emergency medical personnel with resuscitation equipment. (Sec. 7) Provides for boxing registration with the appropriate boxing commission of an Indian tribe. Requires (current law urges) a boxing commission to make a health and safety disclosure to a boxer when issuing an identification card. Requires a copy of each boxer registration and each identification card to be furnished to the USBC. (Sec. 8) Requires each boxing commission to establish procedures for review of a summary suspension when a hearing is requested which provides an opportunity for a person to present evidence. Repeals procedures for allowing a boxer under suspension in a state to participate in a match outside that state. (Sec. 10) Requires the USBC (currently Association of Boxing Commissions) to develop guidelines for boxing contracting requirements and for rating professional boxers. Provides for notification of a change in rating. (Sec. 13) Requires the sanctioning organization for a match and its promoter to provide disclosures of charges, fees, and contractual agreements within 7 days of a match of 10 rounds or more. (Sec. 14) Requires statements of bout fees and charges to be written. Requires broadcasters broadcasting a match of 10 rounds or more to provide the USBC with: (1) a statement of any advance, guarantee, or license fee paid to a promoter in connection with the match; (2) a copy of any relevant executed contracts concerning such match; and (3) a list of sources of income received from the broadcast of the match. Requires: (1) an affected boxing commission, upon request, to be furnished a copy of all such information; and (2) the protection of the confidentiality of all broadcaster information provided. (Sec 15) Prohibits a promoter from arranging a championship match or a match scheduled for ten rounds or more unless all participating judges and referees have been licensed by the USBC. Allows a sanctioning organization to provide a list of judges and referees deemed qualified, but requires the boxing commission to select, license, and appoint the participating referees and judges. Authorizes the assignment of nonresident judges and referees. Requires all participating judges and referees to disclose all consideration received for participation. (Sec. 16) Directs the USBC to establish and maintain a registry of comprehensive medical records and medical denials or suspensions for every licensed boxer. (Sec. 17) Applies conflict-of-interest provisions to USBC officers and employees, boxers, and requirements for enforcement of the Act. (Sec. 19) Repeals requirements for certain studies concerning boxer pensions and health and safety issues. (Sec. 21) Establishes the USBC as a commission within the Department of Commerce to protect the health, safety, and general interests of boxers and to ensure uniformity, fairness, and integrity in professional boxing. Provides for the licensing and registration of boxing personnel, including managers, promoters, and sanctioning organizations. Requires the USBC to establish and maintain a national computerized registry of such personnel. Authorizes the USBC to suspend or revoke boxer licenses or registrations for violating or failing to meet standards of the Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996 or when necessary to protect health, safety, or the public interest. Requires annual USBC reports to specified congressional committees on its activities. Requires such reports to include an overview of licensing and enforcement activities of state and tribal organization boxing commissions. Authorizes appropriations. Renames the Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996 as the Professional Boxing Safety Act. (Sec. 22) Requires the USBC to study and report to specified congressional committees on how the term \"promoter\" should be defined for purposes of the renamed Act."
