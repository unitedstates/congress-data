    "text": "Drug Free Communities Enhancement Act of 2010 - Authorizes the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy to make enhancement grants to eligible entities to implement comprehensive community-wide strategies that address emerging local drug issues or local drug crises within the areas served by such entities. Defines \"eligible entity\" as an organization that is a recipient of a grant under the National Narcotics Leadership Act of 1988 and that, using local data, has documented rates of use and abuse for such an issue or crisis that are above the national average and that continue over a sustained period. Requires enhancement grants to be used to implement comprehensive, community-wide prevention strategies to address such an issue or crisis and to obtain specialized training and technical assistance. Limits such grants to a four-year period and to a maximum annual amount of $75,000. Requires the Director to: (1) rescind such grants for intentional violations of grant conditions or for fraud; and (2) report to the Judiciary Committees of Congress by December 31 of each year on grants awarded. Requires eligible entities to report annually to the Director on multi-sector plans for addressing an emerging local drug issue or local drug crisis and on grants they have received under this Act. Requires the Comptroller General to conduct annual audits, beginning in FY2011, of at least 10% of grant recipients. Authorizes appropriations for FY2011-FY2015."
