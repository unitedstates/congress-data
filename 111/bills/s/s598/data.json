    "text": "Appliance Standards Improvement Act of 2009 - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to authorize any person to petition the Secretary of Energy to prescribe or amend test procedures that are used to measure energy use by: (1) covered products under the Department of Energy's (DOE's) energy conservation program for consumer products; and (2) certain industrial equipment. Requires DOE to respond to petitions within 180 days and publish a rule on the standard within three years if a petition is granted. Revises the Energy Star Program by: (1) requiring the Secretary and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to update agreements that delineate DOE and EPA responsibilities; (2) expanding the duties of the Secretary and the Administrator, to include reviewing product categories at least once every three years or when market share for a category reaches 35%, updating product criteria for categories, requiring qualified products to demonstrate compliance with criteria, and developing standardized building energy audit methods; and (3) authorizing appropriations for the Program. Requires test procedures for LED fixtures and LED light engines to be based on Illuminating Engineering Society of North America test procedure LM-79, Approved Method for Electrical and Photometric Testing of Solid-State Lighting Devices. Establishes minimum energy efficiency standards for portable light fixtures manufactured on or after January 1, 2012. Phases out the use of incandescent light bulbs in portable light fixtures. Excludes a GU-24 base lamp from the definition of an incandescent lamp. Prohibits GU-24 adaptors from adapting a GU-24 socket to any other line voltage socket. Requires the Secretary to conduct studies on: (1) compliance with appliance energy standards; and (2) the costs and benefits of requiring high-quality, direct-current electricity supply in certain buildings. Requires the Secretary to assess the use of electric motors and the electric motor market in the United States and establish a program to increase awareness of higher efficiency electric motors."
