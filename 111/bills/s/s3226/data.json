    "text": "Program for Offshore Wind Energy Research and Development Act of 2010 or the POWERED Act of 2010 - Requires the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to initiate the development of a comprehensive roadmap to assist and coordinate offshore wind power implementation efforts. Defines \"offshore wind power\" to mean the generation of electricity from the deployment of wind turbines in the Great Lakes and other inland navigable waters or in U.S. coastal waters, including the territorial sea, the exclusive economic zone, and the outer continental shelf. Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish the Offshore Wind Power Research and Development Program to assist and coordinate offshore wind power analysis and implementation efforts consistent with the roadmap; (2) award grants to academic institutions or industry-academic consortia to establish two or more national offshore wind centers on a competitive basis with an emphasis on technical merit; (3) ensure, in selecting academic institutions or industry-academic consortia, that at least one center focuses on transitional depth and deepwater floating offshore wind energy technologies and at least one center focuses on shallow water offshore wind energy technologies; (4) award grants to states, academic institutions, and industry-academic consortia to conduct coordinated, cohesive offshore wind power analysis, research, and development projects; and (5) request grant proposals for Program projects for implementing specified activities, plans, analysis, studies, and research related to developing offshore wind power. Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as it would be amended by the American Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009 as reported to the Senate as an original measure on July 16, 2009 (S.1462), to revise the federal renewable energy credit trading program by allowing triple credits for the generation of energy from offshore wind power."
