Imposes enhanced criminal penalties for violations. Exempts any controlled substance that has been approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the drug approval process or that has been altered at the direction of a medical practitioner for a legitimate medical purpose. Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to review and amend its sentencing guidelines and policy statements to reflect the enhanced penalties provided by this Act."
