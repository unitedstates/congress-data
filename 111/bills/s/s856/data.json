Waives highway funding reduction relating to weight of vehicles using Interstate System highways with respect to vehicles allowed pursuant to this program. Provides for program termination and for the responsibilities of the state of Maine, including: (1) submitting a plan to the Secretary; (2) establishing a highway safety committee; and (3) collecting data on the net effects of the operation of such vehicles on safety."
