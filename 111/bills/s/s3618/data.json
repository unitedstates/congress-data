Amends the Internal Revenue Code to create: (1) a five-year accelerated depreciation period for tangible property used in the manufacturing of an advanced nuclear power facility; (2) a nuclear power facility construction credit; (3) advanced energy project tax credits for nuclear power facilities; and (4) an American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) nuclear certification credit. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to award a grant to each qualified public entity which places in service a qualified nuclear power facility in order to reimburse it for a portion of its nuclear power facility expenditures. Amends the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 to increase the funding for loan guarantee commitments under the Title 17 Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPA) to revise requirements for the loan guarantees. Amends EPA to direct the Secretary of Energy to offer to enter into cooperative agreements to develop and license specified small modular reactors with a rated capacity under 350 electrical megawatts. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to: (1) modify licensing procedures; (2) direct the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to assume the availability of sufficient capacity to timely dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste from the operation of the nuclear facility on a license application; and (3) prescribe environmental reviews for nuclear energy projects. Authorizes appropriations for training the next generation nuclear workforce. Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish: (1) the National Nuclear Energy Council; (2) the Energy Park Initiative; (3) the Advisory Committee on Energy Park Development; and (4) the N Prize Program. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to establish a tax-exempt United States Nuclear Fuel Management Corporation to assume federal responsibility for spent nuclear fuel management. Establishes in the Treasury the United States Nuclear Fuel Management Corporation Fund."
