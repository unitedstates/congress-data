    "text": "National Manufacturing Strategy Act of 2010 - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the U.S. government should promote policies related to the nation's manufacturing sector intended to promote growth, sustainability, and competitiveness, create well-paying jobs, enable innovation and investment, and support national security; and (2) the President and Congress should act promptly to pursue policies consistent with a National Manufacturing Strategy (Strategy). Directs the President, every four years, to submit to Congress, and publish on a public website, a Strategy. Requires the first Strategy to be submitted within one year after enactment of this Act. Directs the President to establish, within the Department of Commerce, the President's Manufacturing Strategy Board to: (1) advise the President and Congress on issues concerning the manufacturing sector; (2) conduct a comprehensive analysis of such sector; (3) develop a Strategy; and (4) report annually to the President and Congress on the current state of U.S. manufacturing. Directs the Comptroller General, in each of 2013, 2017, and 2021, to submit to Congress an assessment and analysis of the Strategy. Directs the President to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to conduct a study concerning U.S. manufacturing and related assessments and reviews. Requires the NAS to report each study's results to Congress and the President. Requires the President, in each annual budget, to include information regarding that budget's consistency with the goals and recommendations included in the latest Strategy."
