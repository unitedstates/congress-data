Limits such exemption to type III supporting organizations classified as such before August 17, 2006, no substantial contributor to which was alive on such date, and having no family member of a substantial contributor as an organization manager or a borrower or lessee of property from the organization, if either: (1) the organization has not accepted any contribution from a substantial contributor after December 31, 1970, other than by operation of the creator's will or other gift instrument executed before December 31, 1970; or (2) the organization normally distributes each year, to keep its tax exemption, at least 85% of its adjusted net income for the immediately preceding year and holds 30% or more of the reasonably estimated value of its total assets, other than those used or held for use directly in carrying out one or more specified religious, charitable, scientific, literary, educational, or related purposes, in the form of assets for which market quotations are not readily available but which normally produce gross investment income."
