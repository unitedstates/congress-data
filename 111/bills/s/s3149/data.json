    "text": "Wall Street Compensation Reform Act of 2010 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to restrict the tax deduction for compensation paid to highly-paid employees of systemically significant financial institutions. Requires such compensation to be performance-based, to vest no earlier than five years after the date of payment, and to consist of 50% employer stock. Prohibits such highly-paid employees from using personal hedging strategies and remuneration or liability-related insurance and requires forfeiture of compensation paid to a chief executive or financial officer of such an institution if an accounting restatement is required due to material noncompliance, as a result of misconduct, with any federal financial reporting requirement. Defines a \"systemically significant financial institution\" as an entity which engages primarily in financial activities (as determined under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956) and which: (1) owns or controls assets greater than $25 billion; or (2) owns or controls assets greater than $10 billion and maintains a ratio of debt to equity greater than 20 to 1. Requires each systemically significant financial institution which is a publicly held corporation to make an annual report on its compensation policies and practices to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and make such report publicly available."
