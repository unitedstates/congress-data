Excludes any health care practice, accounting practice, or legal practice with 20 or fewer employees from the meaning of creditor subject to Red Flag Guidelines regarding identity theft promulgated by the proper federal financial regulatory agency. Excludes any other business which the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) determines: (1) knows all its customers or clients individually; (2) only performs services in or around the residences of its customers; or (3) has not experienced incidents of identity theft, and identity theft is rare for businesses of that type. States that such exclusion shall no longer apply to any business that can no longer meet such eligibility criteria."
