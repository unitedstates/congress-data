Requires, if a meat or meat food product sample tests positive for enteric foodborne pathogen contamination, a trace to identify: (1) adulteration and contamination sites, including preparation, packaging, and slaughtering establishments; and (2) the original adulteration or contamination source. Requires, if a raw ground meat sample tests positive for enteric foodborne pathogen contamination at a preparation, packaging, or slaughtering establishment, subsequent daily sampling at the establishment and any supplying establishments for at least 15 consecutive days after the date on which the adulterated or contaminated sample is collected."
