Permits the Secretary of the Interior, five years after this Act's enactment, to initiate a process to include the Rocky Mountain gray wolf on such a list upon certifying to Congress that a state, by and through its management plan, has not provided for the maintenance within the state of not fewer than 10 breeding pairs and an aggregate of 100 Rocky Mountain gray wolves."
