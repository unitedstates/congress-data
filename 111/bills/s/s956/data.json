(Thus exempts from the surety bond requirement any state-licensed retail pharmacy that has not been subject to such an adverse action for at least 10 years. Such adverse actions refer to: (1) a Medicare-imposed revocation of any Medicare billing privileges; (2) suspension or revocation of a license to provide health care by any state licensing authority; (3) revocation or suspension by an accreditation organization; (4) conviction of a federal or state felony offense within the last 10 years preceding enrollment, revalidation, or re-enrollment; or (5) an exclusion or debarment from participation in a federal or state health care program.)"
