Makers a conforming amendment to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008 to repeal the exception to such prohibition National Air and Space Administration (NASA) contracts to purchase a generally available fuel that is not an alternative or synthetic fuel or predominantly produced from a nonconventional petroleum source, if certain conditions are met."
