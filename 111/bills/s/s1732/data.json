Directs the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the Institute of Medicine to conduct a study on: (1) the standards and definitions of health care applied to health care systems in Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, the U,S. Virgin Islands, Micronesia, Palau, or the Marshall Islands; (2) the status and performance of health care systems in such areas; (3) the effectiveness of donor aid in addressing health care needs and priorities in such areas; and (4) progress toward implementing recommendations of the Institute's Committee on Health Care Services in the United States-Associated Pacific Basin that are set forth in the 1998 report, \"Pacific Partnerships for Health; Charting a New Course for the 21st Century.\""
