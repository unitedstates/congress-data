Allows such waiver for up to two years. Provides conditions to be considered by the Administrator in determining whether to exercise such waiver, including economic conditions affecting the intermediary as well as the impact the waiver would have on the program. Provides an identical waiver, with the same conditions, with respect to: (1) grants made to intermediaries for small business marketing, management, and technical assistance; and (2) the SBA's women's business center program."
