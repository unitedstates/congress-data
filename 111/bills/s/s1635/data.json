    "text": "7th Generation Promise: Indian Youth Suicide Prevention Act of 2009 - (Sec. 4) Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Indian Health Service, to carry out a demonstration project to award up to five grants to Indian tribes and tribal organizations operating one or more facilities for the provision of telemental health services to Indian youth who: (1) have expressed suicidal ideas; (2) have attempted suicide; or (3) have mental health conditions that increase or could increase the risk of suicide. Establishes grant application and eligibility requirements. Regulates how the grants are to be used, including permitting tribal organizations to use and promote traditional tribal health care practices. Requires reports by the Secretary to Congress and an annual report by grant recipients to the Secretary. Authorizes appropriations for FY2010-FY2013. Defines \"telemental health\" as the use of electronic information and telecommunications technologies to support long-distance mental health care, patient and professional-related education, public health, and health administration. (Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary, acting through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), to carry out measures necessary to maximize the efficiency of the process by which Indian tribes and tribal organizations apply for grants under any SAMHSA-administered program. Prohibits any tribal organization from being required to provide a nonfederal share of the cost of any activity carried out using a grant provided by SAMHSA. Requires the Secretary, regardless of whether a tribe possesses adequate personnel or infrastructure to submit a grant application or fulfill all other program requirements, to ensure the provision of adequate suicide prevention and mental health services to Indian tribes: (1) the members of which experience a high rate of youth suicide, low socioeconomic status, and extreme health disparity; (2) located in a remote and isolated area; and (3) lacking technology and communication infrastructure. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to ensure that each entity serving Indian youth and that receives a grant for suicide intervention, prevention, or treatment under any SAMHSA-administered program train individuals who interact frequently with Indian youth (including parents, teachers, coaches, and mentors) on identifying suicide warning signs. (Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary to carry out activities to encourage tribal organizations and mental health care providers to obtain the services of predoctoral psychology and psychiatry interns. (Sec. 7) Authorizes the Secretary, through SAMHSA, to establish and carry out a demonstration program to provide not more than five grants to: (1) identify a culturally compatible, school-based, life skills curriculum for the prevention of Indian and Alaska Native adolescent suicide; (2) identify the tribes with the greatest adolescent suicide risk; (3) invite those tribes to participate in the demonstration program; and (4) provide grants to implement the curriculum for Indian and Alaska Native youths who are between 10 and 19 and attend school in a region with a high youth suicide risk. Establishes grant application requirements and regulates how the grants are to be used. Requires a report to Congress. Authorizes appropriations for FY2010-FY2014."
