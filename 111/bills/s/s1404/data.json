Allows FQHCs to use grant funds to: (1) conduct needs assessments; (2) use available technologies to collect, organize, and provide access to patient health and mental health information and to provide referrals, train staff, monitor service delivery and outcomes, and create networking opportunities; (3) adapt and implement evidence-based parenting skills training programs for caregivers; (4) screen caregivers (by trained professionals) for child maltreatment risk factors and provide access to mental health services to caregivers screened positive for child maltreatment risk factors; (5) develop public education campaigns; and (6) evaluate patient satisfaction, project cost effectiveness, and effectiveness of evidence-based parenting programs in improving parenting practices and reducing child abuse and neglect. Directs the Secretary to contract with institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, and other entities to provide technical assistance and project coordination for grant recipients, training for health care professionals at FQHCs, and cross-site evaluation of demonstration projects."
