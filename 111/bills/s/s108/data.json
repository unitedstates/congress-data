Prohibits: (1) a U.S. court from ordering the release or parole into the United States of a covered alien; (2) the Secretary of State from issuing any visa to a covered alien that would permit such alien to enter, or be admitted to, the United States; and (3) the Secretary of Homeland Security from admitting or providing any type of immigration status to a covered alien that would permit such alien to enter, or be admitted to, the United States. Authorizes the President to waive restrictions by the Secretaries if consistent with U.S. national security."
