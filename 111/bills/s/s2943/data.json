Provides that if any of the intelligence officials believe that any action proposed by the AG may prevent the collection of intelligence related to terrorism or threats of violence against the United States or its citizens, the AG may not initiate such action without specific direction from the President. Requires an annual report from the AG to Congress on the occasions on which direction for action was sought from the President and the number of times the President directed such actions."
