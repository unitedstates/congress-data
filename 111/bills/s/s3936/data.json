    "text": "States as Energy Leaders for the Future Act or SELF Act - Establishes in the Department of Energy (DOE) a program to provide grants to eligible entities, on a competitive basis, to develop and carry out clean energy and carbon reduction measures, such as renewable electricity standards, regional or statewide climate action plans, and participation in a regional greenhouse gas reduction program. Directs the Secretary of DOE, in establishing criteria for grants, to take into account: (1) regional disparities in the ways in which energy is produced and used; and (2) the clean energy resource potential of the measures. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from the definition of \"domestic production gross receipts\" for purposes of the tax deduction for income attributable to domestic production, the gross receipts of a major integrated oil company which are derived from oil related qualified production activities."
