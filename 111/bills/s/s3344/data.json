Requires the Commission to evaluate: (1) current and future impact of the oil disaster on the environment, economy, and public health; (2) the adequacy of the response to the oil disaster; (3) the implications of the oil disaster, and any risk of other such disasters, for offshore oil and gas activities by the United States; and (4) the availability and accuracy of baseline data against which the impact of the oil disaster may be measured. Requires the Commission to develop recommendations to: (1) improve the response to the oil disaster, including through modification of proposed plans to mitigate and monitor its impact; and (2) minimize the risk and mitigate the impact of future such disasters (including changes to federal law and regulations and improvements in industry practices).
