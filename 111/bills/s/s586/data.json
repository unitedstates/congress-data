Directs the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to require the Directors of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health to improve the timelines of the review process for neurology and psychiatry.Requires the Director of the National Neurotechnology Coordination Office to establish the American Neurotechnology Study Center."
