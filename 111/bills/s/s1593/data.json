Authorizes appropriations for debt and equity financing for a Microfinance Growth Fund for the Americas. Directs the Secretary of State to: (1) establish an advisory group on the feasibility of establishing a new public-private Fund for Social and Economic Development in the Americas; (2) conduct a joint study to determine the best strategy for increasing the use of renewable energy sources in the Americas; and (3) work with interested governments in Central America, South America, the Caribbean, and Mexico (the Region) to study mechanisms to facilitate regional and hemispheric carbon trading. Authorizes appropriations to USAID: (1) for labor and environmental capacity building activities relating to the implementation of trade promotion agreements; (2) for programs in the Americas to reduce global warming; (3) to support activities in the Region involving adaptation to, and reduction in the negative impact of, environmental changes brought about by global warming and activities promoting sustainable forest management and reduction of deforestation. Expresses support for the establishment of an Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas."
