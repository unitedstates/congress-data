Requires the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to investigate, prosecute, and provide quarterly reports on instances of fraud related to the first-time homebuyer tax credit. Requires tax return preparers to file tax returns electronically unless they reasonably expect to file 100 or fewer individual income returns in a calendar year."
