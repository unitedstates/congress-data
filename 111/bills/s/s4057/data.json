Permits the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) or the Secretary of the Treasury to deny waivers only if: (1) the state plan does not meet requirements for granting a waiver; (2) the Secretary of HHS or Treasury notifies the state in writing of the requirements that the state plan did not meet and provides the state with information used in making such a determination; and (3) the state is given an opportunity to appeal. Requires the Secretary of HHS or Treasury to reconsider the determination in the event of an appeal."
