Sets the amount of such credit at 20% of such increase for employers that employ fewer than 100 employees and 15% for employers that employ 100 or more employees in any quarter. Limits the total credit amount available for all quarters to $500,000. Directs the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to: (1) notify all employers required to withhold employment taxes of the enactment and applicability of this Act; and (2) report to Congress on enforcement measures taken to prevent and penalize fraud related to the payroll credit allowed by this Act."
