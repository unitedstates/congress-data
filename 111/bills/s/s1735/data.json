Allows land to be taken into trust for the Lumbee Tribe. Requires treating an application to take land located in Robeson County, North Carolina, into trust as an \"on reservation\" trust acquisition under regulations concerning land acquisitions. Prohibits the Tribe from conducting gaming activities as a matter of claimed inherent authority or under the authority of any federal law, including the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act."
