    "text": "International Cybercrime Reporting and Cooperation Act - Directs the President to report annually to Congress regarding: (1) foreign countries\u0092 use of information and communications technologies (ICT) in critical infrastructure, cybercrime based in each country, the adequacy of each country\u0092s legal and law enforcement systems addressing cybercrime, and online protection of consumers and commerce; (2) multilateral efforts to prevent and investigate cybercrime, including U.S. actions to promote such multilateral efforts; and (3) countries for which action plans have been developed. Directs the President to give priority for assistance to improve legal, judicial, and enforcement capabilities with respect to cybercrime to countries with low ICT levels of development or utilization in their critical infrastructure, telecommunications systems, and financial industries. Directs the President to develop an action plan (with legislative, institutional, or enforcement benchmarks) and annual compliance assessment for each country determined to be a country of cyber concern: (1) from which there is a pattern of cybercrime incidents against the U.S. government, private U.S. entities, or other U.S. persons; and (2) whose government is uncooperative with efforts to combat cybercrime. Urges the President to take restrictive actions against a country that has not complied with the appropriate benchmarks with respect to: (1) the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC); (2) the Export-Import Bank of the United States; (3) multilateral development financing; (4) the Trade and Development Agency; (5) preferential trade programs; and (6) foreign assistance. Authorizes the President to waive the requirements to develop an action plan or make a determination of cyber concern if in U.S. national interest. Directs the Secretary of State to: (1) designate a high-level Department of State employee to coordinate anti-cybercrime activities; and (2) assign an employee to have primary responsibility for cybercrime policy in each country or region significant to U.S. anti-cybercrime efforts."
