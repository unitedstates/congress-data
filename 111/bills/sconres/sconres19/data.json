Supports President Karzai's decision to analyze the draft law and strongly urges him not to publish it until it has been revised to be consistent with internationally recognized rights of women. Encourages the Secretary of State, the Special Representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues, and the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan to consider the status of women's rights and security in Afghanistan. Encourages the government of Afghanistan to solicit information and advice from the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Women's Affairs, the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, and women-led nongovernmental organizations to ensure that legislation and policies uphold the equal rights of women."
