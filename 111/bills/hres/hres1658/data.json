Expresses support for the efforts of the government of Mexico to investigate the case, safeguard the survivors and witnesses, and prosecute the parties responsible. Recognizes: (1) that the government of Mexico has adopted a comprehensive strategy for the prevention of the kidnapping of migrants; and (2) the important reform bill passed by the Mexican Congress that would allow undocumented migrants to file complaints and receive medical treatment. Urges the governments of the United States, Mexico, and nations throughout Latin America to commit to greater collaboration on the management and reform of migration policies and to work together to address the economic and social factors driving high rates of irregular migration."
