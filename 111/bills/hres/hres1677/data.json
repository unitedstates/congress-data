Insists that Burma's military regime begin an immediate transition toward national reconciliation and the full restoration of democracy. Demands the release of detained Buddhist monks, and all other political prisoners and prisoners of conscience. Calls on the Administration to: (1) not recognize the military regime's elections as legitimate; and (2) implement the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008 by nominating the Special Representative and Policy Coordinator on Burma and by imposing appropriate financial sanctions. Calls on the Burmese junta to permit members of the democratic opposition and ethnic minorities to participate in the government. Calls for full accountability of those responsible for human rights violations. Urges support for an international inquiry to investigate the Burmese regime's war crimes and crimes against humanity."
