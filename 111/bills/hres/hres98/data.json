Makes it out of order to consider any legislation between the two chambers making or continuing appropriations to the end of a fiscal year that includes appropriations for the Department of the Treasury for that fiscal year, unless the measure includes a provision to bar such pay adjustment, or the rule providing for its consideration allows a vote proposing to bar it."
