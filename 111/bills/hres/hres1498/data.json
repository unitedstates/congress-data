Recognizes the importance of motorcycle crash prevention as the primary source of motorcycle safety. Encourages NHTSA to: (1) focus on crash prevention and rider education as the most significant priorities in motorcycle safety; and (2) provide appropriate congressional committees a statement why it believes it is less important to focus on crash prevention, rider education and training, proper licensing, and reducing impaired riding than on mandating universal helmet use. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that any law that supersedes state laws regarding the use of helmets as it applies to denial of health coverage and benefits resulting from an injury sustained while riding a motorcycle should not be implemented."
