Applies such prohibition only to legislation providing or authorizing discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority, providing a federal tax deduction, credit, or exclusion, or modifying the Harmonized Tariff Schedule in FY2011. Excludes from such prohibition any authorization of appropriations to a federal entity which is not specifically targeted to a state, locality, or congressional district. Prohibits the House Committee on Rules from reporting a rule or order that would waive such point of order."
