Urges the military forces of Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, and South Sudan, as well as U.N. peacekeeping forces, to protect civilians, ensure that operations target only LRA commanders and avoid endangering abducted children and noncombatants, and strengthen efforts to demobilize lower-level combatants and captives. Calls for President Obama to appoint a senior diplomat to work with regional and international governments to find a permanent solution to the crisis."
