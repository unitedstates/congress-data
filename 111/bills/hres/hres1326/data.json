Calls on Japan to accede to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Calls on the President of the United States and the Secretary of State to continue raising the issue of abduction and wrongful retention of U.S. citizen children in Japan. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States should: (1) recognize the issue of child abduction to and retention of U.S. citizen children in Japan as an issue of paramount importance to the United States within the context of its bilateral relationship with Japan; (2) work with the government of Japan to enact consular and passport procedures and legal agreements to prevent parental abduction to and retention of children in Japan; (3) review the advisory services available to U.S. citizens from government agencies to ensure that assistance is given to U.S. citizens in preventing the wrongful retention or removal of children and in obtaining the expeditious return of their children from Japan; (4) review its advisory services for members of the U.S. Armed Forces, particularly those stationed in Japan, to ensure that preventive education and legal assistance are made available; and (5) call upon the Secretary to establish procedures with the government of Japan to resolve parental child abduction or access issues."
