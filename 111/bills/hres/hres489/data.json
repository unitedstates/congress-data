Calls on the People's Republic of China (PRC) to: (1) invite independent investigations into the Tiananmen Square crackdown; (2) end its harassment and detention against those who were involved in the 1989 protests and against those who continue to advocate peacefully for political reform such as Mr. Liu Xiaobo and his wife, Liu Xia; and (3) allow protest participants who escaped to or are living in exile in the United States and other countries to return to China without risk of retribution. Calls on the legal authorities of the PRC to review immediately the cases of those still imprisoned for participating in the 1989 protests and to release those individuals imprisoned solely for peacefully exercising their internationally-recognized rights. Calls on the Administration and Congress to mark the 20th anniversary of Tiananmen Square by meeting with participants in the demonstrations who are living in the United States or elsewhere outside of China, supporting those in China who demand an accounting of the June 1989 events, and supporting those advocating for democratic governance in China."
