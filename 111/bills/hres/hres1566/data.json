Encourages the people of the United States to recognize and celebrate the legal victories of the national sit-in movement that sought to eradicate segregation in U.S. society. States that the House of Representatives aspires to work with the same courage, determination, dignity, and commitment exemplified by those pioneering students who dared to challenge a segregated society by addressing modern-day inequalities and injustice."
