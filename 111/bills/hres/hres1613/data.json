Supports the use of funds authorized by the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009 to provide long-term recovery and rehabilitation for flood-affected areas and populations and urges a reexamination of priorities for spending such funds with a view toward ensuring that the needs of the Pakistani people are appropriately addressed in the aftermath of the disaster.
