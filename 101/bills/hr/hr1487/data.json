    "text": "Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 - Title I: Department of State - Part A: Authorization of Appropriations; Allocations of Funds; Restrictions - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1990 and 1991 for the Department of State for: (1) diplomatic operations (allocates such amounts as may be necessary for the Office of Munitions Control); (2) the diplomatic security program; (3) international organizations and conferences (with earmarked funds for the South Pacific Commission for FY 1990); (4) international peacekeeping activities; (5) international conferences and contingencies; (6) international commissions; (7) migration and refugee assistance, including assistance for refugees resettling in Israel; and (8) other programs, including bilateral science and technology agreements and Soviet-East European research and training. Earmarks specified amounts of migration and refugee assistance for: (1) displaced Tibetans in India and Nepal; (2) displaced Burmese on the Thailand-Burma border; and (3) Turkey for assistance to ethnic Turkish refugees fleeing Bulgaria. Prohibits the use of funds appropriated for international conferences and contingencies for any U.S. delegation to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), unless such delegation includes individuals representing the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to provide that if an amount appropriated pursuant to an Act other than an appropriation Act is less than the authorization amount and the Act provides for earmarked funds, such funds shall be reduced to an amount bearing the same ratio to such funds as the amount appropriated bears to the authorization amount. Authorizes amounts appropriated to the Department of State to be obligated for 12-month contracts to be performed over two fiscal years. Amends the International Security and Development Cooperation Act to prohibit the use of any funds for the conduct of the Middle East peace process dialogue with any representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) who has participated in a terrorist activity resulting in the death or kidnapping of a U.S. citizen. Prohibits the channeling or diverting of funds for any activity for which U.S. assistance is prohibited. Prescribes penalties for such violations. Requires the President to notify the Congress whenever any officer or employee of the executive branch advocates, promotes, or encourages such activity. Part B: Department of State Authorities and Activities; Foreign Missions - Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to authorize the Secretary of State to use appropriated funds for: (1) obligations assumed in Germany on or after June 5, 1945; (2) telecommunications services; and (3) the provision of maximum physical security in Government-owned and leased properties and vehicles abroad. Authorizes special agents of the Department of State and the Foreign Service to make arrests without warrant for any offense concerning passport or visa issuance if there are grounds to believe that a person has committed or is committing such offense. Removes violations of specified sections of the criminal code from a list of violations for which such agents are authorized to make arrests without a warrant. Adds the Department of State to the list of agencies to which criminal justice agencies are required to make available criminal record information regarding individuals under investigation by the Department for determining the eligibility of such individuals for access to classified information or assignment to sensitive national security duties. Amends the Diplomatic Security Act of 1986 to direct the Secretary to develop and implement programs for the safe and efficient evacuation of U.S. Government personnel, dependents, and citizens when their lives are endangered. Requires such policies to include measures to identify high risk areas where evacuation may be necessary and, if appropriate, to provide staff to U.S. missions abroad to assist in such evacuations. Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to require the Secretary, in the case of a major disaster or incident abroad which affects the health and safety of U.S. citizens, to provide prompt notification of all information concerning such disaster or incident to the next-of-kin of such individuals.
