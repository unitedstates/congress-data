    "text": "Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 - Title I: Provisions for Attainment and Maintenance of National Ambient Air Quality Standards - Subtitle A: In General - Amends the Clean Air Act to require State Governors to designate areas within a State as nonattainment, attainment, or unclassifiable, with regard to air quality standards, and to submit such designations to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) no later than one year after the promulgation of a new or revised air quality standard. Authorizes the Administrator to modify such designations, as necessary. Designates areas currently required to be listed under the Clean Air Act as nonattainment, attainment, or unclassifiable areas, as specified. Provides for the redesignation of areas, as appropriate. Prohibits the redesignation of any area from nonattainment to unclassifiable. Revises the boundaries of Serious, Severe, or Extreme ozone or carbon monoxide nonattainment areas located in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) or consolidated metropolitan statistical areas (CMSAs) to include the entire MSA or CMSA unless the State Governor notifies the Administrator that additional time is necessary to evaluate such revision. Excludes areas within the MSA or CMSA that do not contribute to violation of the air quality standard, subject to the Administrator's approval. Designates: (1) areas identified (in 52 Federal Register 29383) as Group I areas as particulate matter 10 (PM-10) nonattainment areas; (2) areas containing sites for which air quality monitoring data show a violation of national air quality standards for PM-10 before 1989 as PM-10 nonattainment areas; and (3) areas not meeting either description as PM-10 unclassifiable areas. Authorizes the Administrator to require States to designate areas with respect to the national air quality standard for lead. Revises provisions concerning State implementation plan requirements. Sets forth provisions for plan approval and revision. Requires plans to provide for attainment of national air quality standards in nonattainment areas within three years of this Act's enactment or within five years of a finding of substantial inadequacy. Retains a moratorium on construction or modification of major stationary sources in certain areas until such areas meet applicable requirements concerning permit programs or attainment standards for sulfur dioxide. Repeals provisions concerning: (1) extensions of time for attainment dates; (2) requirements concerning parking surcharges and transportation regulations; and (3) suspensions of certain plan requirements. Requires the Administrator to publish a triennial (currently, annual) document which sets forth applicable requirements of the implementation plan for each State. Directs States to submit implementation plans within three years, or such shorter period as the Administrator prescribes (currently, nine months), of the promulgation of an air quality standard. Sets forth plan conformity requirements. Sets the date of attainment of national air quality standards for a nonattainment area at five years from the date such area was designated. Authorizes the Administrator to extend such attainment date, provided that such extension does not exceed ten years. Permits up to two one-year extensions to be granted to a single area upon application by a State. Requires States to submit nonattainment plans within three years of the designation of an area. Makes technical amendments to provisions concerning nonattainment plan requirements. Requires the Administrator, after relaxing an air quality standard, to promulgate requirements applicable to areas that have not attained the standard as of the date of such relaxation. Provides for controls with respect to such areas that are at least as stringent as the controls applicable to areas designated nonattainment before such relaxation. Authorizes the issuance of a permit to construct or operate a new source if demonstrated that the benefits of such source significantly outweigh environmental and social costs. Prohibits the use of existing growth allowances in areas which are notified that implementation plans containing such allowances are substantially inadequate. Allows new or modified major stationary sources to comply with any offset requirement for increased air pollutant emissions with reductions of the pollutant from such sources or from other sources in the same nonattainment area. Permits the sources to obtain reductions in another nonattainment area if the other area has an equal or higher nonattainment classification and emissions from the other area contribute to violations of air quality standards in the area in which the sources are located. Requires such reductions to be in effect by the time such sources commence operation and to assure that the total tonnage of increased emissions is offset by an equal or greater reduction in the actual emissions from the same or other area sources. Provides that incidental emissions reductions not required by this Act shall be creditable if such reductions meet offset requirements. Authorizes sources to offset by alternative or innovative means emissions increases from rocket engine and motor firing under specified conditions. Requires States containing ozone or carbon monoxide nonattainment areas, together with local officials of such areas, to review and update, as necessary, planning procedures for such areas. Authorizes States, in the case of areas included in more than one State, to implement jointly such planning procedures. Requires revisions to State implementation plans to be submitted pursuant to requests for redesignations of nonattainment areas and to provide for maintenance of air quality standards for: (1) ten years after the redesignation; and (2) an additional ten years after the expiration of the first ten-year period. Authorizes the Administrator, whenever it is determined that the interstate transport of air pollutants from one or more States contributes significantly to a violation of an air quality standard in such States, to establish a transport region for such pollutants within such States. Requires the Administrator to establish a transport commission for each such region to: (1) assess the degree of interstate transport of the pollutant or precursors to the pollutant throughout the transport region; (2) assess strategies for mitigating the interstate pollution; and (3) recommend to the Administrator such measures as may be necessary to ensure that State plans meet requirements of this Act. Permits such commissions to request the Administrator to issue a finding that one or more of the States in a transport region have inadequate implementation plans. Applies program cost limitations for interstate air quality agencies to such commissions. Imposes one or all (under certain circumstances) of the following sanctions on States which fail to comply with requirements concerning nonattainment areas: (1) a prohibition on Department of Transportation highway funding; (2) increased emissions offset requirements; and (3) a withholding of all or part of assistance for air pollution planning and control programs. Requires States which fail to attain air quality standards by the required attainment date to submit plan revisions. Directs the Administrator to promulgate a Federal implementation plan if any State fails to make a required submission or such submission is not approved. Classifies ozone nonattainment areas as Marginal, Moderate, Serious, Severe, or Extreme, based upon the amount by which the air quality standard is exceeded in the area. Sets forth attainment dates of three, six, nine, fifteen, and twenty years from this Act's enactment, respectively, for Marginal, Moderate, Serious, Severe, and Extreme areas. Provides for an attainment date of 17 years after this Act's enactment for Severe areas with specified 1988 ozone design values. Authorizes the Administrator to adjust the classification of areas which would be classified in another area if the ozone level were five percent greater or less. Prohibits more than two one-year attainment extensions from being issued for a single nonattainment area. Provides for the reclassification of areas (except for Severe or Extreme areas) which fail to meet required standards. Sets forth specific requirements for Severe areas which fail to meet such standards. Requires States in which Marginal areas are located to submit to the Administrator a current inventory of actual emissions from all sources. Directs such States to submit plan revisions to require: (1) correction requirements for available control technology; (2) a vehicle inspection and maintenance program; (3) permits for the construction and operation of new or modified stationary sources; (4) triennial inventories; and (5) emissions statements from owners or operators of stationary sources of oxides of nitrogen or volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Waives requirements for the submission of triennial inventories for sources which emit less than 25 tons annually of nitrogen oxides or VOCs if the State provides an emissions inventory for such sources to the Administrator. Directs the Administrator to review and update the guidance for State motor vehicle inspection programs. Requires Moderate areas to comply with the requirements for Marginal areas. Directs States containing Moderate areas to submit plan revisions that require: (1) VOC emissions reductions, within six years of this Act's enactment, of at least 15 percent from baseline emissions (or a lower percentage under specified conditions); (2) the implementation of reasonably available control technology with respect to all VOC sources covered by a Control Techniques Guideline and all major stationary sources of VOCs; and (3) owners and operators of gasoline dispensing systems to install and operate systems for gasoline vapor recovery of emissions from the fueling of motor vehicles (applies such requirement to facilities selling more than 10,000 gallons of gasoline per month or 50,000 gallons per month, in the case of independent small business gasoline marketers). Sets forth deadlines for the installation of such systems. Prohibits the following measures from being credited to the 15 percent VOC reduction: (1) measures relating to the motor vehicle tailpipe or evaporative emissions promulgated by the Administrator; (2) regulations concerning Reid Vapor Pressure promulgated by the Administrator; (3) measures concerning required corrections to implementation plans; and (4) measures concerning motor vehicle inspection and maintenance. Requires Serious areas to comply with the requirements for Moderate areas. Directs the Administrator to promulgate rules for enhanced monitoring of ozone, nitrogen oxides, and VOCs. Requires States to implement programs to improve monitoring of such substances. Directs States containing Serious areas to submit plan revisions that provide for: (1) attainment of the ozone air quality standard by the applicable attainment date; (2) certain VOC emissions reductions from the baseline emissions averaged over three-year periods, beginning six years after this Act's enactment; (3) programs to reduce hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions from in-use motor vehicles in urbanized nonattainment areas with populations over 200,000; (4) clean-fuel vehicle programs in areas with populations over 250,000; and (5) transportation control measures in areas where vehicle mileage, emissions, and congestion levels exceed levels projected for attainment. Permits such revisions to provide for combined VOC and nitrogen oxide emissions (in lieu of sole VOC reductions) that would result in reductions equivalent to those required for VOC emissions from the baseline level. Directs the Administrator to issue guidance concerning the conditions under which nitrogen oxide control may be substituted, or combined with, VOC control to maximize the reduction in ozone. Permits the Administrator to approve substitutes for clean-fuel vehicle programs if such substitutes will achieve equivalent reductions of ozone-producing emissions. Authorizes States to offset the impact of increased vehicle mileage and congestion levels by implementing controls on other sources that would produce emissions reductions comparable to those achieved by a transportation control program. Provides that increased VOC emissions resulting from physical or operational changes in stationary sources in Serious areas shall not be considered de minimis for purposes of permit requirements unless the increase in emissions does not exceed 25 tons when aggregated with all other increases in emissions from such a source over a five-year period. Sets forth provisions concerning modifications of major stationary sources in such areas. Requires Severe areas to comply with the requirements for Serious areas. Directs States containing Severe areas to submit plan revisions that provide for: (1) reasonably available techniques for reducing vehicle emissions and the adoption of specific enforceable strategies and control measures to offset any growth in emissions from growth in vehicle miles traveled or numbers of vehicle trips; and (2) specified enforcement measures for areas failing to meet attainment deadlines. Requires Extreme areas to comply with the requirements for Severe areas, with specified exceptions. Directs States in which Extreme areas are located to submit plan revisions that require: (1) electric utilities and industrial and commercial boilers emitting more than 25 tons annually of nitrogen oxides to burn as a primary fuel natural gas, methanol, ethanol, or a comparably low-polluting fuel or to use advanced control technology to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions; and (2) traffic control measures during heavy traffic hours. Sets forth provisions concerning modifications of sources in such areas. Authorizes the Administrator, under specified conditions, to approve provisions of an implementation plan for an Extreme area which anticipate development of new control techniques and an attainment demonstration based upon such provisions. Applies plan provisions applicable to major stationary sources of VOCs in ozone nonattainment areas to major stationary sources of nitrogen oxides in such areas, with specified exceptions. Sets forth offset ratios for each classification of an ozone nonattainment area. Requires States containing Serious, Severe, or Extreme ozone nonattainment areas to submit to the Administrator demonstrations that attainment milestones have been met. Requires States containing Serious or Severe areas not meeting such milestones to elect to: (1) have the area reclassified to the next higher classification; (2) implement measures adequate to achieve the next milestone; or (3) adopt an economic incentive program to reduce ozone emissions. Provides for reclassifications of areas for which the State fails to make an election. Directs States containing Extreme areas not meeting such milestones to submit a plan revision to implement an economic incentive program. Provides that States containing rural transport ozone nonattainment areas that do not include or are not adjacent to MSAs shall be treated as satisfying this Act's requirements if they make submissions required for Marginal areas. Permits the Administrator to treat such areas as rural transport areas if found that VOC and nitrogen oxide emissions within such areas do not contribute significantly to ozone concentrations in any area. Sets forth requirements for multi-State ozone nonattainment areas. Makes sanctions inapplicable to a State which demonstrates that it would have been able to meet an ozone attainment deadline for a multi-State nonattainment area but for the failure of another State to meet requirements. Requires the Administrator to: (1) review and update existing control technique guidance; and (2) give priority to categories that make the most significant contribution to ozone air pollution in issuing guidelines. Directs the Administrator to issue control techniques guidelines to reduce: (1) VOC emissions from aerospace coatings and solvents; and (2) VOC and PM-10 emissions from paints, coatings, and solvents used in shipbuilding and ship repair. Requires the Administrator to: (1) issue technical documents identifying alternative controls for stationary sources of VOCs and nitrogen oxides that have the potential to emit 25 tons annually of such pollutants; and (2) provide guidance to States for use in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of various options for the control of emissions from stationary sources contributing to ozone air pollution. Directs the Administrator to: (1) study and report to the Congress on VOC emissions from consumer and commercial products; and (2) regulate products that account for at least 80 percent of VOC emissions from such products in ozone nonattainment areas. Authorizes such regulations to exempt health use products for which there are no suitable substitutes. Provides for State enforcement of such regulations, subject to the Administrator's approval. Requires the Administrator to establish a clearinghouse on information, studies, and regulations regarding such products. Directs the Administrator to promulgate standards applicable to air pollutant emissions from loading and unloading of marine tank vessels which may endanger public health or welfare. Applies such standards to loading and unloading facilities. Directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to issue regulations to ensure the safety of the equipment and operations to control such emissions. Prohibits States from adopting any less stringent emissions standards. Requires the Administrator to study and report to the Congress on whether current methodology used to establish a design value for ozone provides a reasonable indicator of the ozone air quality of ozone nonattainment areas. Subjects such study to peer review. Establishes an ozone transport region comprised of coastal States on the east coast between Maine and Maryland and the CMSA including the District of Columbia. Requires the Administrator to establish an interstate transport commission for such region. Directs States within such regions to submit implementation plans or revisions requiring: (1) areas located in such regions that are part of an MSA with a population of at least 100,000 to comply with enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance programs; and (2) implementation of reasonably available control technology with respect to VOC sources covered by a control techniques guideline. Requires the Administrator to study and implement control measures capable of achieving emissions reductions comparable to those achievable through vehicle refueling controls required for Moderate ozone nonattainment areas. Provides for revisions of State plans to reflect such measures. Authorizes interstate commissions to develop recommendations for additional control measures. Outlines administrative review procedures for such measures. Directs the Administrator to promulgate criteria for determining the contribution of sources in one area to concentrations of ozone in another nonattainment area. Sets a fee of $5,000 per ton of VOC emitted during a calendar year in excess of 80 percent of the baseline amount for major stationary sources in Severe and Extreme ozone nonattainment areas which fail to attain standards by the applicable date. Defines a major stationary source as a source with the potential to emit: (1) 25 tons annually of VOCs in Severe areas; or (2) 10 tons annually of VOCs in Extreme areas. Requires such fees to be adjusted annually. Exempts from such fee areas with populations under 200,000 if demonstrated that attainment is prevented because of ozone transported from other areas. Suspends fee requirements until 1992 for areas that were not in violation of air quality standards from 1987 through 1989. Requires the Administrator to study and report to the Congress on the role of ozone precursors in tropospheric ozone formation and control. Classifies carbon monoxide nonattainment areas as Moderate or Serious. Authorizes the Administrator to adjust such classification under conditions parallel to those for ozone nonattainment areas. Sets forth attainment dates of December 31, 1995, and December 31, 2000, for Moderate and Serious areas, respectively. Sets forth provisions for attainment extensions and reclassifications parallel to those for ozone nonattainment areas. Requires States containing Moderate carbon monoxide areas to submit to the Administrator a current inventory of actual emissions from all sources. Directs such States to submit plan revisions to require: (1) a forecast of vehicle miles traveled in areas exceeding a specified carbon monoxide design value and special control measures if mileage exceeds such forecast or the area fails to attain the standard by the applicable deadline; (2) vehicle inspection and maintenance programs; (3) triennial inventories; and (4) attainment demonstrations and annual emissions reductions. Requires Serious areas to comply with requirements for Moderate areas. Directs States in which Serious areas are located to submit plan revisions that require: (1) transportation control measures; and (2) the use of oxygenated fuels in CMSAs or MSAs. Directs Serious areas in which stationary sources contribute significantly to carbon monoxide levels to submit plan revisions that provide that the term \"major stationary source\" includes sources having the potential to emit at least 50 tons annually of carbon monoxide. Authorizes the Administrator to waive requirements pertaining to transportation controls, inspection and maintenance, or oxygenated fuels where mobile sources do not contribute significantly to carbon monoxide levels. Requires the Administrator to issue guidelines and rules for determining whether stationary sources contribute significantly to carbon monoxide levels. Directs States containing Serious carbon monoxide nonattainment areas to submit to the Administrator, by March 31, 1996, a demonstration that emissions reductions equivalent to those required by December 31, 1995, have been met. Requires States failing to meet the attainment milestone to submit a plan revision to implement an economic incentive and transportation control program. Sets forth provisions concerning multi-State carbon monoxide nonattainment areas parallel to those for multi-State ozone nonattainment areas. Requires States containing Serious areas that fail to meet the attainment deadline to implement an economic incentive program to reduce total tonnage of carbon monoxide emissions by five percent annually until attainment. Classifies PM-10 nonattainment areas as Moderate or Serious. Sets forth procedures and a timetable for reclassification of such areas. Provides for attainment dates of December 31, 1994, and December 31, 2001, for Moderate and Serious Areas, respectively. Sets forth provisions for attainment extensions parallel to those for ozone and carbon monoxide nonattainment areas. Permits additional extensions to be granted to Serious areas, under specified conditions. Limits such extensions to a period of five years. Authorizes the Administrator to waive any requirement or attainment date for a Serious PM-10 area if determined that anthropogenic sources of PM-10 do not contribute significantly to violations of the PM-10 standard in such area. Requires States containing Moderate PM-10 areas to submit plans that include: (1) a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified PM-10 sources; (2) a demonstration on whether attainment is practicable by the applicable date; and (3) the implementation of reasonably available control measures. Requires Serious areas to comply with the requirements for Moderate areas. Sets forth a schedule for plan submissions. Requires plan revisions for PM-10 nonattainment areas to contain quantitative milestones to be achieved every three years until attainment. Directs States failing to meet milestones to submit a plan revision assuring that they will achieve the next milestone or attainment, as appropriate.

Credits such allowances to a Reserve for Gas Supply Interruptions. Allocates unused allowances triennially to such units on a pro rata basis. Requires the Administrator, for each ton of sulfur dioxide emissions avoided by an electric utility through the use of qualified energy conservation measures or renewable energy, to issue an allowance to the utility from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve. Sets forth specified requirements for the issuance of such allowances. Permits allowances to be issued only: (1) to units owned by an electric utility implementing a least cost energy plan; and (2) with respect to kilowatt hours of electric energy saved by energy conservation measures or generated by renewable energy after 1991 and before the earlier of December 31, 2000, or the date on which the unit to which the allowance is issued becomes subject to this title. Sets forth allowance application requirements for electric utilities. Requires the Administrator to establish a Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve to make available, in accordance with a specified timetable, allowances equivalent to 400,000 tons of emissions. Provides that if allowances remain in the Reserve after January 2, 2011, the Administrator shall issue 75 percent of such allowances to Second Phase affected units on a pro rata basis. Entitles independent power producers to receive the Administrator's written guarantee that allowances will be made available for purchase at a guaranteed price if the producer: (1) proposes to construct a new independent power production facility for which allowances are required; (2) will apply for financing to construct such facility after January 1, 1990, and before the date of a specified early allowance auction; (3) has submitted to each First Phase affected unit an offer to purchase allowances for $750 per ton; and (4) has not received an acceptance of the offer within 180 days after submission of the offer. Sets forth eligibility requirements for producers seeking such guarantee. Affords guarantee recipients the opportunity to purchase allowances from the Direct Sale Reserve before such allowances are offered for sale to any other person. Directs the Administrator to issue incentive allowances to First Phase affected units during the First Phase if: (1) the unit has reduced sulfur dioxide emissions in any year after the date of this Act's enactment and before the First Phase; (2) the emissions reductions are not required by this Act; (3) the reductions are obtained solely through the installation or use of a continuous emissions reduction system which achieves at least a 70 percent reduction from the potential combustion concentration; and (4) the unit complies with specified monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements. Requires each incentive allowance to authorize a single ton of sulfur dioxide emissions for a single year during the First or Second Phase. Prohibits such allowances from being allocated for reductions resulting from reduced utilization. Waives the requirement that emissions reductions be obtained through a continuous emissions reduction system to permit specified units to receive allowances for early reductions. Makes certain incentive allowance requirements inapplicable to units located in States that have enacted a law, as of January 1, 1990 (to be effective in 1993), that requires reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions by at least 40 percent below the State's 1980 levels. Authorizes such units to receive allowances for reductions achieved after this Act's enactment and before the effective date of the State law as long as there is no net decrease in high sulfur and mining jobs attributable to such action. Provides for alternative allowance allocations for units electing to calculate baselines by utilizing their average annual fuel consumption at a 60 percent capacity factor.

Establishes deadlines for Second Phase sulfur dioxide emissions and nitrogen oxide emissions requirements with respect to: (1) the submission of permit applications and compliance plans; and (2) the issuance of permits by States to affected sources. Requires the Administrator, if a State fails to issue permits by the required deadline, to issue such permits by January 1, 1998. Authorizes the submission of revised applications or plans. Makes it unlawful to: (1) fail to submit an application or plan in accordance with deadlines; or (2) operate any source, except in compliance with a permit program. Authorizes owners or operators of Second Phase affected units, by January 1, 1998, to demonstrate to the permitting authority that such units will be repowered with a qualifying clean coal technology. Requires such owners or operators, as part of such demonstration, to provide documentation of a preliminary design and engineering effort for such repowering, an executed contract for the majority of repowering equipment, and such other information as may be required by December 31, 2000. Treats the replacement of an existing electric utility steam generating unit with a new unit using a repowering technology which is located at a different site as repowering of the existing unit. Grants owners or operators satisfying repowering requirements an extension of compliance with Second Phase requirements for repowered units from December 31, 2000, to December 31, 2003. Authorizes owners or operators of units granted extensions that demonstrate that a clean coal repowering technology has been unable to achieve emissions reductions to retrofit or repower such units with another control technology. Exempts repowered units (except for new units) replacing existing units from specified standards of performance and the requirements of parts C and D of the Clean Air Act if the projected emissions from the repowered units will not result in increases of emissions of any pollutant regulated under this Act. Directs the Administrator, for the period of an extension, to grant annual allowances for sulfur dioxide to the owners or operators of affected sources. Prohibits the transfer or use of such allowances by any other source to meet emissions requirements under this title. Requires owners or operators to notify the Administrator in advance of the date on which the affected unit is to be removed from operation to install repowering technology. Establishes emissions rates and allowances for such sources. Provides for allocations of such allowances to oil- and gas-fired units selected for negotiations leading to the award of clean coal demonstration funding by the Secretary of Energy. Makes such units ineligible for compliance extensions. Makes it unlawful for owners or operators of repowered sources to fail to comply with repowering requirements. Authorizes owners or operators of units or process sources that are not affected units for sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides to: (1) elect to designate such units or sources as affected units; and (2) submit such designations to the Administrator for approval. Directs the Administrator to establish a baseline for such units based on fuel consumption and operating data from 1985 through 1987. Establishes an allowance formula for affected units (except process sources). Bases Second Phase allowances for nitrogen oxide from designated units on the rates prescribed for affected units. Provides that designated units shall not be subject to nitrogen oxides emissions rate requirements for affected units. Directs the Administrator to establish a program for designating process sources in operation before this Act's enactment as affected units. Requires the Administrator to issue allowances and permits to affected units. Permits the transfer and banking of allowances by designated units. Prohibits designated units from transferring or banking allowances produced as a result of reduced utilization or shutdown or compliance with this Act unless the reduced utilization or shutdown results from the replacement of thermal energy from the designated unit and such unit's allowances are for use at other replacement units. Makes owners or operators of affected sources that emit excess sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides liable for the payment of an excess emissions penalty based on excess tonnage. Requires such individuals to: (1) offset the excess emissions by an equal tonnage amount in the following year or such period as the Administrator may prescribe; and (2) submit a plan to achieve such offsets to the Administrator and the State. Directs the Administrator to: (1) deduct allowances equal to the excess tonnage from those issued for the source for the years following the year in which the excess emissions occurred; and (2) adjust the penalty for inflation, based on the Consumer Price Index, beginning in 1996.

Authorizes State regulatory authorities to require regulated electric utilities whose annual sales of electric energy exceed 500,000,000 kilowatt hours to identify expenditures needed, made, and projected to be made for purposes of compliance with First or Second Phase requirements. Prohibits such utilities from including such expenditures in rates imposed on income-eligible retail ratepayers. Requires a public hearing to be held on the issue of exempting low-income residents. Defines an income-eligible retail ratepayer as any ratepayer of an electric utility who: (1) provides documentation to the utility establishing that the ratepayer is eligible for specified public assistance benefits; or (2) leases units in a multiple unit residential dwelling in which at least 2/3 of the units are occupied by individuals eligible for such benefits. Directs utilities to publicize such program to the low-income community. Makes persons who fraudulently supply false documentation liable to the utility for an amount three times the amount of the reduction in rates. Sets forth specified allowance allocations for the Joppa (Illinois), Kyger Creek (Ohio), and Clifty Creek (Indiana) powerplants. Directs the Secretary of Energy to require affected units at listed First Phase powerplants that provide more than 75 percent of the energy generated to Federal facilities to utilize continuous emissions reduction systems or to purchase allowances, or both. Requires the Secretary to pay the costs of constructing and installing such systems and a share of the operating costs proportional to the energy purchased by the Secretary. Directs the Administrator, before March 31, 1992, to conduct an early allowance auction to permit owners or operators of affected units to offer allowances for sale.

Sets forth requirements concerning such reserves. Requires allowance sale proceeds to be transferred to owners or operators of units from whom allowances were withheld. Makes State regulated electric utilities ineligible for interpollutant trading unless the State regulatory authority certifies to the Administrator that: (1) each State utility shall implement a plan to meet demand at the lowest system cost; and (2) the authority shall review such plans and identify regulatory mechanisms to ensure that such plans are profitable to the utility and that utility investments in energy conservation and load management measures do not impair a utility's ability to earn its rate of return. Requires owners or operators of unregulated Phase I affected utilities to implement and biennially update a least-cost plan. Directs State regulatory authorities choosing not to implement regulatory reforms to submit a report to the Administrator. Requires the Administrator to promulgate revised standards of performance for new electric utilities to prohibit sources subject to such standards from emitting pollutants in an amount greater than that allowed before the standards' revision.

Exempts an OCS source from a requirement if compliance with a pollution control technology is technically infeasible or will cause a threat to health and safety. Requires the Administrator to ensure that any increase in emissions due to an exemption is offset by reductions in actual emissions by the exempted source or other sources in the area. Provides for State enforcement of such requirements, subject to the Administrator's discretion. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to assure coordination of air pollution control regulations between OCS areas adjacent to Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama and onshore areas. Requires the Secretary to: (1) complete a research study examining the impacts of emissions from OCS activities in such areas that fail to meet air quality standards for ozone or nitrogen dioxide; and (2) consult with the Administrator to determine if additional actions are necessary. Authorizes appropriations. Applies certain study and regulatory requirements concerning the Great Lakes, the Chesapeake Bay, and their tributaries to U.S. coastal waters. Authorizes appropriations for specified grants for air quality planning. Directs the Administrator to conduct a study and test program on the development of a hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle. Requires the Administrator to: (1) promulgate regulations requiring all affected sources subject to title V to monitor carbon dioxide emissions in accordance with such title; and (2) make such emissions data available to the public. Title VIII: Other Provisions - Authorizes the Administrator to negotiate with Mexican representatives to establish a program to monitor and improve air quality along the U.S.-Mexican border region. Requires the monitoring component of such program to identify sources of pollutants for which national ambient air quality standards and other air quality goals have been established. Authorizes the Administrator to negotiate with the appropriate Mexican representatives to develop remediation measures to reduce the level of pollutants to achieve air quality standards in the border region. Requires such program to identify control measures the implementation of which would be expedited by U.S. material and financial assistance. Directs the Administrator to utilize resources of Mexico to offset the costs to the United States in implementing joint remediation measures. Requires the Administrator to report annually to the Congress on the progress of the program in bringing the U.S.-Mexican border region into attainment with air quality standards. Directs the Administrator, in providing direct financial assistance to Mexico for the monitoring and remediation programs, to develop grant agreements with Mexico to assure the accuracy of monitoring data and the performance of remediation measures financed by the United States. Requires the Administrator, when approving State implementation plans, to take into account the impacts of the sources of pollutants coming from Mexico and the role of the United States in developing monitoring and remediation plans with Mexico to bring about attainment of air quality standards in regions along the border in the United States. Directs the President to report to the Congress on: (1) the economic effects of this Act's air quality standards and of the differences between such standards and the controls of major U.S. trading partners on the international competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers; and (2) a strategy for addressing such effects through trade consultations and negotiations. Requires the Comptroller General to report to the Congress on the incremental health and environmental benefits and costs beyond current clean air requirements of the control strategies and technologies required by this Act. Establishes a United States-Mexico Air Quality Office within the EPA Office of International Activities. Requires the Director of the United States-Mexico Office to study: (1) the prospects in Mexico for clean-fuel automobiles and clean fuels; and (2) the possibility of standardized air quality regulations for the United States and Mexico. Directs the Administrator to study and report to the Congress on the health and environmental impacts of the combustion of contaminated used oil in ships and the reasons for, and alternatives to, using such oil. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) existing equipment and machinery retrofitted to comply with the Clean Air Act and all other specifications be produced in the United States and purchased from American manufacturers; (2) the construction of new industrial and utility facilities comply with the Act through the incorporation of American made equipment and technology; and (3) the public sector strive to purchase and produce American products that improve U.S. air quality. Title IX: Clean Air Research - Directs the Administrator to: (1) conduct research, testing, and development of methods for sampling, measurement, monitoring, analysis, and modeling of air pollutants; (2) conduct research on the short- and long-term effects of air pollutants on human health; (3) conduct research to improve the understanding of the causes, effects, and trends of ecosystem damage from air pollutants; and (4) conduct an engineering research and technology program to develop and demonstrate air pollution prevention strategies and technologies. Requires the Administrator to implement a plan to coordinate such research with other Federal ecological and air pollution research. Directs the President to submit to the Congress: (1) a plan for Federal research on acid deposition; (2) an assessment framework for reporting complicated technical information about acid deposition in a manner useful to policymakers and the public; and (3) a report on the reduction in deposition rates that must be achieved to prevent adverse ecological effects. Requires the Administrator to conduct a research program to predict air emissions and other environmental effects related to the use of clean alternative fuels to determine the risks and benefits to health and the environment relative to those from gasoline and diesel fuels. Directs the Administrator to study and report to the Congress on whether air pollution control technologies in selected industrialized countries have beneficial applications to U.S. air pollution control efforts. Requires the Administrator to: (1) establish a program to research the effects of acid deposition on waters where acid deposition has been most acute; and (2) enter into a research contract with a university that has a field laboratory on a body of water between 25,000 and 75,000 acres which lies within a Biosphere Reserve, as designated by the Department of State. Authorizes appropriations. Title X: Disadvantaged Business Concerns - Requires each research contract under this Act to provide that at least ten percent of the research will be conducted by a disadvantaged business concern. Deems the following institutions to be disadvantaged business concerns: (1) historically black colleges and universities and colleges and universities in which 40 percent of the students are Hispanic; (2) minority institutions (as defined by the General Education Provision Act); and (3) private and voluntary organizations controlled by individuals who are socially and economically disadvantaged."
