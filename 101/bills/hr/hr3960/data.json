    "text": "Central Utah Project Completion Act - Title I: Central Utah Project Construction - Authorizes additional appropriations for the Colorado River water storage project (CRSP), to be available solely for design, engineering, and construction of the Central Utah Project (CUP), the planning and implementation of certain fish and wildlife and recreation mitigation and conservation projects and studies, and the Ute Indian Rights Settlement authorized under this Act. Requires the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) to implement specified recommendations prepared by the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior with respect to the financial management of the CRSP. Earmarks specified amounts of such additional funds for various reclamation projects and features within Utah. Permits counties in which such projects and features were proposed to be located to participate in certain local development projects. Provides for the termination of the authorization of appropriations for construction of any CRSP participating project located in Utah five years after the enactment of this Act unless the Secretary: (1) executes a cost-sharing agreement with non-Federal entities for construction of such project; and (2) has requested construction funds for such project. Directs the Secretary to: (1) make appropriated funds available in their entirety to non-Federal interests as provided for pursuant to the provisions of this Act; and (2) report to the Congress by April 15, 1991, on the status of CRSP participating projects for which construction has not begun as of October 15, 1990. Makes specified amounts available, subject to certain restrictions, for features of the Bonneville Unit of the CUP, including: (1) an irrigation and drainage system; (2) a feasibility study and development of systems to allow ground water recharge, management, and the conjunctive use of surface and ground water resources; (3) a feasibility study of irrigation improvements to facilitate the acquisition of certain Strawberry Basin water rights and to increase efficiency, enhance beneficial uses, and achieve greater water conservation within Wasatch County; (4) a feasibility study to reduce the salinity of Utah Lake; (5) a feasibility study of direct delivery of Colorado River Basin water from the Strawberry Reservoir or elsewhere in the Strawberry Collection System to the Provo River Basin, and evaluating the potential for changes in existing importation patterns and quantities of water from the Weber and Duchesne River Basins; and (6) completing construction of the Diamond Fork System. Directs the Secretary, in exchange for and as a precondition to approval of the Strawberry Water Users Association's petition for Bonneville Unit water, to impose conditions on such approval so as to ensure that the Association manages and develops specified lands in a manner compatible with the management and improvement of adjacent Federal lands for wildlife purposes, natural values, and recreation. Prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary from permitting commercial or other development of specified Federal lands. Makes specified amounts available to increase efficiency, enhance beneficial uses, and achieve greater water conservation within the Uinta Basin, including funds for: (1) the construction of the Pigeon Water Reservoir, together with an enclosed pipeline conveyance system to divert water from Lake Fork River to Pigeon Water Reservoir and Sandwash Reservoir; (2) the construction of the McGuire Draw and Clay Basin Reservoirs; (3) the rehabilitation of Farnsworth Canal; and (4) the construction of permanent diversion facilities identified by the Utah Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Commission on the Duchesne and Strawberry Rivers, the designs of which shall be approved by the Federal and State fish and wildlife agencies. Sets forth various requirements and restrictions on, and provisions setting conditions for the termination of authorizations for, the Bonneville Unit water development and the Uinta Basin replacement project. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) contract with the Uintah Water Conservancy District for the retention by the United States of responsibility for part of the municipal and industrial water obligation with a corresponding part of the water supply to be controlled and marketed by the United States in conformance with State law; (2) establish a conservation pool of 4,000 acre feet in Red Fleet Reservoir to enhance associated fishery and recreational opportunities and for other purposes recommended by the Commission; and (3) enter into an agreement with the Utah Division of Parks and Recreation for the management and operation of Red Fleet recreational facilities. Provides that the non-Federal share of the costs for the design, engineering, and construction of the Bonneville Unit water development and the Uinta Basin replacement project shall be 35 percent and, for the specified feasibility studies, 50 percent. Prohibits the obligation or expenditure of amounts for such development and project, with exceptions, until: (1) the Secretary or the Central Utah Water Conservancy District (the District), at the District's option, completes a Definite Plan Report for the Bonneville Unit and a feasibility study for the Uinta project; (2) the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 have been satisfied; and (3) a plan has been developed and approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to prevent any harmful contamination of waters due to concentrations of selenium or other such toxicants, if the Service determines that development of the particular system may result in contamination. Bars the provision of Federal funds under this Act to any non-Federal interest until any such interest enters into a binding agreement with the appropriate Federal authority to comply with this Act and to be considered a \"Federal agency\" for purposes of compliance with all Federal fish, wildlife, recreation, and environmental laws with respect to the use of such funds. Requires the District, at the option of specified eligible counties, to rebate to such counties all ad valorem tax contributions paid by such counties to the District with interest but less the value of any benefits received by such counties and less the administrative expenses incurred by the District to that date. Directs the Secretary, upon request of eligible counties that elect not to participate in the project, to provide as grants to such counties sums for potable water distribution and treatment, wastewater collection and treatment, agricultural water management, and other public infrastructure improvements approved by the Secretary. Bars the use of available funds for the draining of wetlands, the dredging of natural water courses, and planning or constructing water impoundments of greater than 5,000 acre feet, with exceptions.
