Earmarks specified amounts of such assistance for: (1) development assistance; (2) private sector and public investment revitalization; (3) payments of arrearages to international financial institutions; and (4) public administration, administration of justice, and law enforcement training, education, and equipment (includes assistance for other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean). Permits only nonlethal law enforcement equipment to be provided to Panama. Makes limitations on the amount of assistance for law enforcement and the administration of justice under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 inapplicable to assistance provided under this Act. Sets forth reprogramming and notification procedures for specified assistance provided under this title. Commends the Endara Government for taking specified steps with respect to narcotic trafficking and money laundering. Declares that the United States should pursue information sharing and law enforcement arrangements with Panama and use funds to implement financial transaction requirements and the prosecution of drug traffickers and money launderers. Deems Panama to be one of the \"highest priority\" countries under the International Narcotics Control Act of 1988 for purposes of negotiations concerning laundering of U.S. currency. Prohibits more than half of the funds appropriated for Panama from being expended until the Secretary of State certifies to the chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the United States and Panama have signed an agreement that provides for mutual access to financial transaction records for purposes of conducting drug trafficking and money laundering investigations. Permits the President to make a bilateral assistance certification under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (related to countries cooperating with respect to narcotic traffic and money laundering) for Panama for FY 1991 only if an agreement has been signed by the United States and Panama that provides for mutual access to financial transaction and bank records for purposes of drug law enforcement proceedings. Waives provisions of law which prohibit assistance to countries in default on loan repayments to the United States with respect to assistance to Panama and Nicaragua under this Act. Authorizes supplemental appropriations for assistance to Nicaragua for FY 1990. Earmarks specified amounts of such assistance for: (1) the Nicaraguan economy; (2) payments of arrearages to international financial institutions; and (3) the voluntary demobilization, repatriation, and resettlement of members of the Nicaraguan Resistance and their families (subject to certain conditions) and of refugees and displaced persons. Repeals a provision which prohibits assistance for victims of civil strife from being channeled through the Nicaraguan Government. Permits assistance to Nicaragua to be used for law enforcement training and services. Authorizes the suspension of assistance to Nicaragua if: (1) there is not a peaceful and complete transition from the existing Sandinista government to the elected Government of Nicaragua; or (2) it is in U.S. interests to suspend such assistance.

Authorizes supplemental appropriations for assistance to the Caribbean for FY 1990. Earmarks a specified amount of such assistance for the Eastern Caribbean. Amends the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 to increase the amount authorized to be appropriated for migration and refugee assistance for FY 1990. Amends the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962 to raise the limit on the amount authorized to be appropriated for the U.S. Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund. Provides for the transfer of excess amounts in the Fund for: (1) the reimbursement of State and local governments for expenses incurred with respect to migrants; (2) assistance to the African-American Hebrew community in Israel; and (3) a U.S. contribution to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East.

Authorizes supplemental appropriations for FY 1990 for economic and development assistance for Subsaharan Africa.

Authorizes supplemental appropriations for FY 1990 for assistance to encourage negotiations for a peaceful transition to democracy in South Africa. Provides that assistance shall only be available for organizations committed to a suspension of violence in the context of such negotiations.

Makes funds for military credit sales under the Arms Export Control Act available for economic assistance purposes. Permits funds appropriated for counter-narcotics programs under the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1990 to be used to finance the leasing of helicopters to Bolivia and Peru under the Arms Export Control Act.

Requires the USIA Director to provide for the operation in Florida of an educational institution to be known as the North-South Center. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Development Fund for Africa - Development Fund for Africa Act - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President to provide assistance for long-term development in Subsaharan Africa. Provides that the purpose of such assistance is to help the poor majority of Subsaharan Africans to participate in development through economic growth that is equitable, participatory, environmentally sustainable, and self-reliant. Requires AID to take into account the local-level perspective of poor Subsaharan Africans during the planning process for project and program assistance. Declares that AID should make available funds for private and voluntary organizations which have demonstrated effectiveness in, or a commitment to, the promotion of local activities on behalf of development in Subsaharan Africa. Provides for the participation and integration of African women in such development activities. Requires such assistance to emphasize projects to address critical sectoral priorities for long-term development. Designates such priorities as: (1) increased agricultural production and the maintenance and restoration of renewable natural resources; (2) improved health conditions; (3) increased access to voluntary family planning services; (4) improved relevance, equity, and efficiency of education; and (5) the development of income-generating opportunities for the unemployed and underemployed.
