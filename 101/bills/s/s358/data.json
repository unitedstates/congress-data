    "date": "1990-10-26", 
    "text": "Immigration Act of 1990 - Title I: Immigrants - Subtitle A: Worldwide and Per Country Levels - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) to set a permanent annual worldwide level of immigration, to begin in FY 1995, with a transition level for FY 1992 through 1994. Sets forth formulas to divide such worldwide level into worldwide levels for the following categories: (1) family-related immigrants; (2) employment-based immigrants; and (3) diversity immigrants. Excludes from such direct numerical limitations specified categories of special immigrants or aliens, including refugees. Sets forth per country levels for the maximum portion (ceiling) of a country's total number of immigrant visas which may be for family-sponsored and employment-based immigrants. Makes exceptions to such ceiling if additional visas are available, under specified conditions. Sets forth special rules for: (1) spouses and children of lawful permanent resident aliens; and (2) countries at such ceiling. Sets forth special rules for treatment of Hong Kong as a separate foreign state, with specified limitations, under such per country levels. Revises provisions for asylee adjustments. Increases the maximum numerical limitation on adjustment of asylees. Requires annual asylee enumeration. Waives the numerical limitation for certain current asylees. Provides for adjustment of certain former asylees, subject to specified per country limitations. Subtitle B: Preference System - Part 1: Family-Sponsored Immigrants - Allocates annually by preference specified numbers of visas for family-sponsored immigrants, according to certain formulas, among the following groups of aliens: (1) unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens; (2) spouses and unmarried sons and daughters of permanent resident aliens; (3) married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens; and (4) brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens, if such citizens are at least 21 years of age. Sets forth transition provisions for spouses and minor children of certain eligible legalized aliens. Provides for additional visa numbers for such spouses and children in each of FY 1992 through 1994, according to a specified formula. Part 2: Employment-Based Immigrants - Allocates annually by preference specified numbers of visas for employment-based immigrants, according to certain formulas, among the following groups of aliens: (1) priority workers, i.e. those aliens with extraordinary ability, outstanding professors and researchers, or certain multinational executives and managers; (2) members of professions holding advanced degrees, or those aliens with exceptional ability (in each case, requiring labor certification); (3) skilled workers with at least two years' training or experience, professionals with baccalaureate degrees, or a limited number of unskilled shortage workers (in each case requiring labor certification); (4) certain special immigrants (of which allotted number not more than half may be religious workers); and (5) employment creation investors who invest specified minimum amounts (with adjustments for rural areas, high unemployment areas, and high employment areas) which will create at least a specified minimum number of new jobs (with such entrepreneurs and their spouses and children to be admitted on a two-year conditional basis, with procedures to deter immigration-related entrepreneurship fraud). Provides for certain changes in the labor certification process under the Act. Directs the Secretary of Labor to establish a labor market information pilot program for employment-based immigrants, effective for applications for certifications during FY 1992 through 1994. Requires the Secretary of Labor, under such pilot program, to determine labor shortages or surpluses in up to ten defined occupational classifications. Deems a labor certificate to have been issued if there is a labor shortage in an occupation. Permits such a certification even in an occupation with a labor surplus if the employer submits evidence of shortage for a specific job opportunity, based on extensive recruitment efforts. Requires a report to specified congressional committees. Directs the Secretary of Labor, in the labor certification process under the Act, to: (1) require employers, upon application for such certification, to notify the appropriate employee bargaining representative, or, if there is no such representative, to post such notice conspicuously at the worksite; and (2) allow any person to submit documentary evidence bearing on such application. Sets forth transition provisions for employees of certain U.S. businesses operating in Hong Kong. Provides for specified additional numbers of visas during each of FY 1991 through 1993 for such employees (with derivative rules for their family members). Part 3: Diversity Immigrants - Allocates annually (on a permanent basis beginning in FY 1995) specified numbers of visas for diversity immigrants, i.e. natives of foreign states from which immigration was lower than 50,000 over the preceding five years (weighting distribution of such visas in favor of countries in defined regions that are underrepresented in terms of relative regional populations). Limits the percentage of diversity visas for any single foreign state (treating Northern Ireland as a separate foreign state for such purposes). Requires, as a condition of eligibility for a diversity visa, that an alien have at least: (1) a high school education or its equivalent; or (2) two years of work experience in an occupation requiring at least two years of training or experience (within five years of the visa application date). Directs the Secretary of State to maintain information on the age, occupation, education level, and other relevant characteristics of immigrants issued such diversity visas. Sets forth diversity transition provisions for immigrant visas for certain groups, as follows. Provides specified numbers of immigrant visas, in FY 1992 through 1994, for aliens who: (1) are natives of foreign states that are not contiguous to the United States and that are identified as adversely affected by the 1986 repeal of the national origins quota system; and (2) have a firm commitment of U.S. employment for at least one year (earmarking a portion of such visas for that foreign state which received the greatest number of visas under certain provisions for adversely affected states). Provides for immigrant visas in FY 1991 for aliens who have been notified of availability of NP-5 visas (i.e. are notified before a certain date of their selection for a visa as a native of an adversely affected state and are qualified but for certain numerical and fiscal year limitations). Provides for a specified number of immigrant visas, in FY 1991 through 1993, for displaced Tibetans and their relatives. (Requires such Tibetans to have been continuously residing in India or Nepal since before enactment of this Act, but gives preference to those who are not firmly resettled in India or Nepal or who are most likely to be resettled successfully in the United States.) Subtitle C: Commission and Information - Establishes a Commission on Legal Immigration Reform to evaluate the impact of this Act and to analyze and assess the diversity program. Directs the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS Commissioner) to provide for a system for collection and dissemination, at least annually to the Congress and the public, of specified types of statistics and information useful in evaluating the social, economic, environmental, and demographic impact of immigration laws. Requires an annual report to the Congress analyzing trends in immigration and naturalization. Subtitle D: Miscellaneous - Revises special immigrant provisions relating to religious workers. Provides for special immigrant status for: (1) certain aliens employed at the U.S. mission in Hong Kong; and (2) certain aliens declared dependent on a juvenile court. Permits extension of the period of validity of migrant visas for certain residents of Hong Kong. Provides for expedited issuance of Lebanese second and fifth preference visas. Subtitle E: Effective Dates; Conforming Amendments - Sets forth effective dates and conforming amendments. Title II: Nonimmigrants - Subtitle A: General and Permanent Provisions - Revises and extends the visa waiver pilot program for foreign tourists (B nonimmigrants). Denies crewmember status in the case of certain labor disputes. Restricts the use of nonimmigrant alien crewmembers (D nonimmigrants) during a strike or lockout. Sets forth limitations on performances of longshore work by alien crewmembers (D nonimmigrants). Expands availability of the E nonimmigrant visa to include trade in services or technology. Makes certain foreign states eligible for E nonimmigrant visa status on the basis of reciprocity (treaty traders). Revises provisions for temporary workers and trainees (H nonimmigrants). Sets forth annual limitations on numbers in the following categories of H nonimmigrants: (1) temporary (redefined as specialty occupation) workers admitted on the basis of professional education, skills, and/or equivalent experience (H-1B category); and (2) temporary nonagricultural workers (H-2B category). Sets forth, also, an annual limitation on numbers in the following categories under the new P nonimmigrant visa established later in this Act: (1) athletes or entertainers for a specific performance (P-1); and (2) artists or entertainers for a culturally unique program (P-3). Limits the stay of H-1B temporary workers to six years. Removes the foreign residence requirement for H-1B temporary workers. Establishes a system which requires employers to file labor condition applications regarding recruitment, wages, and other conditions, for H-1B temporary workers. Limits H-3B category trainees to training programs that are not designed primarily to provide productive employment. Revises provisions for intra-company transferees (L nonimmigrants). Revises the treatment of certain international accounting firms. Revises procedures for processing intra-company transferees including: (1) requiring a procedure for allowing use of blanket petitions; (2) setting deadlines for processing; and (3) revising the periods of authorized stay and of prior employment with the company. Establishes a new O nonimmigrant classification for aliens with extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics, and for accompanying alien assistants and spouses and children. Establishes a new P nonimmigrant classification for: (1) athletes or entertainers for a specific performance (P-1); (2) artists or entertainers as part of a reciprocal exchange program (P-2); (3) artists or entertainers for a culturally unique program (P-3); and (4) accompanying spouses or children of such aliens (P-4). Establishes a new Q nonimmigrant classification for international cultural exchange programs. Establishes a new R nonimmigrant classification for aliens in religious occupations. Subtitle B: Temporary or Limited Provisions - Directs the Attorney General, during FY 1992 through 1994, to grant off-campus work authorization for students who are F nonimmigrants, under specified conditions, including employer attestation to the educational institution and the Secretary of Labor. Directs the INS Commissioner to report to the Congress by April 1, 1994, on the impact of such work authorization program on prevailing wages of workers and whether such program should be extended. Directs the Attorney General to provide for admission of nonimmigrants for certain cooperative research and development or coproduction projects under a government-to-government agreement administered by the Secretary of Defense. Limits the number of such nonimmigrants and family members admitted to not more than 100 at any one time and the admission period to not more than ten years. Establishes a special education exchange visitor program. Directs the Attorney General to provide for the admission of nonimmigrants as participants in such training program, providing for practical training experience in education of children with physical, mental, or emotional disabilities. Limits the number of such nonimmigrants to not more than 50 in any fiscal year, and the admission period to not more than 18 months. Subtitle C: Effective Dates - Sets forth effective dates. Title III: Family Unity and Temporary Protected Status - Directs the Attorney General to provide for a temporary stay of deportation and work authorization for certain eligible immigrants who are spouses or unmarried children of a legalized alien who was provided temporary or permanent residence status under the Act or permanent residence status under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA). Disqualifies, temporarily, such immigrants, who are granted such temporary stay, from certain public welfare assistance, on the same basis as their legalized alien relative. Makes exceptions to such temporary stay for convicted criminals and other specified aliens. Establishes a program for granting temporary protected status and work authorization to aliens in the United States who are nationals of countries designated by the Attorney General to be subject to armed conflict, natural disaster, or other extraordinary temporary conditions. Authorizes the Attorney General to grant such temporary protected status. Prohibits deportation during the period in which such status is in effect. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) authorize such alien to engage in employment in the United States; and (2) provide such alien with an employment authorized endorsement or other appropriate permit. Sets forth provisions relating to benefits and status during such period of temporary protected status. Provides that such alien shall not be considered to be permanently residing in the United States under color or law. Allows a State or local government to deem such alien ineligible for public assistance.
