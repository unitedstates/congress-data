Excludes from a list of officers submitted to a selection board for consideration for early retirement any officer of that grade and competitive category who has been approved for retirement during the fiscal year in which the selection board is convened, or, if different, for retirement in the fiscal year in which any officer selected for the selection board is required to retire. Provides an alternate retirement date for officers not considered by a selection board under such exception, unless the Secretary of the military department concerned approves a modification to such date in order to prevent a personal hardship for the officer or for other humanitarian reasons. Provides a temporary early retirement selection authority for officers holding a regular grade below the grade of lieutenant colonel or commander who will become eligible for retirement before being retired by a selection board and whose names are not on an officer promotion list.

Removes the requirement that each candidate for admission to the Naval Academy must have served at least one year as an enlisted member. Directs the Secretary to appoint a board to review the administration of the athletics programs of the military academies and to determine ways in which the administration of such programs can serve as a model for civilian institutions of higher education.
