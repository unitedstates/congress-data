    "date": "1992-03-16", 
    "text": "Higher Education Amendments of 1992 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to revise and reauthorize its various programs. Title I: Partnerships for Educational Excellence - Revises HEA title I and renames it Partnerships for Educational Excellence. Authorizes appropriations for the following programs: (1) Urban Community Service; (2) Urban and Rural College, University, and School Partnerships; (3) Articulation Agreements; and (4) Access and Equity to Education for All Americans through Telecommunications. Establishes an Urban Community Service program to provide incentives to urban institutions to work together on the most pressing and severe problems in their communities. Establishes an Urban and Rural College, University, and School Partnerships program to improve school retention and graduation rates, student academic skills, opportunities to continue education beyond high school, and prospects for productive employment. Sets forth administrative provisions to provide for: (1) peer review panels for grant applications; and (2) multiyear disbursement of Urban Community Service program grant funds. Establishes an Articulation Agreements program of grants for articulation agreements and planning between partnerships of two-year and four-year institutions of higher education. (Current provisions for the Student Literacy Corps are revised and transferred to title XI.) Directs the Secretary to make such grants to States to make awards to articulation partnerships between qualified institutions, on the basis of either a competition or a formula determined by the State. Provides for allocation of such grant funds to States: (1) by a formula based the relative total amount of student assistance received under HEA title IV by students attending institutions in the State, if the authorization of appropriations for such grants program equals or exceeds a specified amount; or (2) if such authorized amount is less than the specified amount, by competitive grants which the Secretary is authorized to make to States. Sets forth requirements for State and local applications, articulation agreements, and State administrative costs limitation. Includes, among various authorized uses of funds to an articulation partnership, development of agreements with LEAs for vocational course equivalency approval procedures for purposes of satisfying entrance requirements to qualified institutions. Requires States to give priority to grant applications for programs which: (1) encourage teacher education; (2) have, as one partner participating in the agreement, an entity meeting a specified requirement for the tech-prep education program consortia (i.e. a local or intermediate educational agency or area vocational education school serving secondary school students, or a secondary school funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs) under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act; (3) contribute their own institutional resources; (4) are not subject to a student loan default reduction agreement under title IV (Student Assistance) of HEA; or (5) encourage articulation in subject areas of national importance as determined by the Secretary. Sets forth requirements for annual State program reports and for program evaluation by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to: (1) report to the Congress by January 31, 1996, on the results of such evaluation; and (2) disseminate findings relating to the most successful programs. Reserves limited amounts for such purposes. Adds a program for Access and Equity to Education for All Americans through Telecommunications. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to eligible partnerships to enable such partnerships to pay the Federal share (50 percent) of the cost of the education telecommunications activities and services which will benefit nontraditional postsecondary education students, including special services for individuals with disabilities (such as captioned films, television, and descriptive video and education media). Title II: Academic Library and Information Technology Enhancement - Revises HEA title II and renames it Academic Libraries in an Electronic Networked Environment (currently Academic Library and Information Technology Enhancement). Authorizes appropriations for: (1) College Library Technology and Cooperation Grants; (2) Library Education, Research, and Development; (3) Improving Access to Research Library Resources; and (4) Strengthening Library and Information Science Programs in Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Directs the Secretary to ensure that title II programs are administered by appropriate library experts. Eliminates provisions for College Library Resources. Revises the College Library Technology and Cooperation Grants program to add provisions emphasizing the accessing and sharing of library and information resources through technology. Requires the Secretary to give priority, in awarding certain such grants, to institutions of higher education seeking assistance for projects which assist developing institutions of higher education in linking one or more institutions of higher education to resource sharing networks. Increases the required minimum grant amount and sets a maximum amount for certain grants. Requires the Secretary to consult with appropriate library and information science professional organizations to determine: (1) critical needs under provisions for grants and contracts for library education and human resources development, and (2) priorities for awarding grants for research and demonstrations. Revises provisions for library education and human resource development to include assistance for training for library and information science, particularly in areas of critical needs such as recruitment and retention of minorities. Requires that stipends for certain fellowships and traineeships be for those who demonstrate need and are working toward a graduate degree. Revises provisions for research and demonstration projects to include those related to education in library and information science and to enhancement of library services through use of new technology. Revises the grants program for improving access to research library resources to eliminate provisions which precluded such grant recipients from receiving certain other title II grants. Adds a program for Strengthening Library and Information Science Programs in Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Directs the Secretary to make grants to, and contracts with, historically black colleges and universities and library organizations or agencies which have nationally approved programs in library and information science to educate and train African Americans and other ethnic minorities, particularly in areas of critical needs. Requires that at least 75 percent of such funds be used to establish or maintain graduate fellowships or traineeships. Allows the remainder to be used for: (1) costs of courses of study or staff development, including short-term or regular session institutes; and (2) establishing, developing, or expanding programs of library and information science, including new techniques of information transfer and communication technology. Prohibits funding in FY 1993 through 1997 for new programs or expanded programs under this Act, unless and until Congress enacts appropriatiions for HEA title II programs enacted prior to this Act at a level no less than the FY 1992 funding level for such preexisting programs.
