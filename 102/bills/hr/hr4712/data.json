Requires that peer review panels, for such research grants and contracts, be composed of members who are: (1) experts in the field of child abuse and neglect or related disciplines, with appropriate expertise in the application to be reviewed; and (2) not officers or employees of the Office of Human Development.

Revises provisions for development and operation grants to require the Secretary of HHS to make grants to States, based on relative population of children under age 18 in applicant States, for improving each such State's child protective service system in carrying out specified activities.

Requires, if total appropriations for such grants exceed a specified amount, that at least 50 percent of the grant amount to a State be used to support community-based prevention programs. Adds title II grant application demonstration requirements relating to: (1) coordination with other State and local programs; (2) outcome of services and activities funded; (3) supplementation of Federal assistance by State and local public and private sources; and (4) extent of use of funds to support community prevention activities in underserved areas (in which case the supplemental support requirement is waived for the first three years of assistance).
