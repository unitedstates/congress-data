    "as": "Conference report filed in House", 
    "date": "1991-11-27", 
    "text": "Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 - Declares that it is U.S. policy to develop a national intermodal transportation (IT) system that is economically efficient, is environmentally sound, provides the foundation for the nation to compete in the global economy, and will move people and goods in an energy efficient manner. Title I: Surface Transportation - Part A: Title 23 Programs - Declares that the authorizations of appropriations and apportionments for construction of the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways (Interstate System - IS) made by this Act are the final authorizations of appropriations and apportionments for completion of construction of the IS. Directs the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to apportion for all States (other than Massachusetts) for FY 1993 specified sums authorized for such year by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 for expenditure on the IS, based on the apportionment factors contained in Committee Print 102-24 of the House Committee on Public Works and Transportation. Extends specified apportionments for the IS through FY 1996. Authorizes appropriations. Sets forth provisions with respect to: (1) obligation ceilings for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs for FY 1992 through 1997, with exceptions; and (2) the distribution of, limitation on, and redistribution of obligation authority. Authorizes appropriations from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) for: (1) the interstate maintenance program; (2) the National Highway System (NHS); (3) the surface transportation program (STP); (4) the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program; (5) the bridge program; (6) the Federal lands highway program, including Indian reservation roads, public lands highways, and parkways and park highways; (7) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) safety programs; and (8) FHWA highway safety research and development (R&D) programs. Requires: (1) that not less than ten percent of the amounts authorized to be appropriated under titles I (other than part B), III, V, and VI of this Act be expended with small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, with exceptions; (2) each State to annually survey such concerns and compile a list of disadvantaged business enterprises (DBEs) and the location of such concerns in the State and to notify the Secretary, in writing, of the percentage of such concerns which are controlled by women, by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals other than women, and by women who are otherwise socially and economically disadvantaged; and (3) the Secretary to establish minimum uniform criteria for State governments to use in certifying whether a concern qualifies as a DBE. Directs the Comptroller General to: (1) conduct a study of the FHWA's DBE program; and (2) report on the results to specified committees. Makes reductions in specified authorizations. Sets forth provisions with respect to budget compliance. Restructures the Federal-aid highway program by reorganizing it into two Federal-aid systems: (1) the IS; and (2) the NHS. Requires: (1) each State to functionally reclassify the roads and streets in such State; and (2) the Secretary to approve and report to the Congress concerning such reclassification and to study and report on route redesignations of the NHS. Directs the Secretary to establish a flexible program under which a State may expend funds apportioned to it for carrying out any project or activity for which Federal funds may be obligated under Federal highway provisions. Includes among eligible NHS projects: (1) construction, resurfacing, and rehabilitation of segments of such system; (2) highway safety and operational improvements for segments of such system; (3) construction of a transit project eligible for assistance under the Federal Transit Act (FTA) (currently known as the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964; see title III of this Act), subject to specified conditions; (4) highway-related technology transfer activities; (5) fringe and corridor parking facilities; (6) carpool and vanpool projects; (7) bicycle transportation and pedestrian walkways; (8) development and establishment of management systems; and (9) participation in wetland mitigation efforts related to projects funded under this title. Sets forth provisions with respect to: (1) NHS apportionments to the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; (2) transferability of NHS apportionments; and (3) reconstruction projects and funding with respect to national defense highways located outside the United States. Establishes the STP to fund projects such as: (1) construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, resurfacing, restoration, and operational improvements for highways and bridges; (2) capital costs for transit projects eligible for assistance under the FTA and publicly owned intracity or intercity bus terminals and facilities; (3) carpool projects, fringe and corridor parking facilities and programs, and bicycle transportation and pedestrian walkways; (4) highway and transit safety improvements and programs; (5) highway and transit R&D and technology transfer programs; (6) transportation enhancement activities; (7) development and establishment of management systems; and (8) participation in wetlands mitigation efforts related to projects funded under this title. Sets forth provisions with respect to: (1) project location; (2) allocations of apportioned funds; (3) administration; and (4) allocation of obligation authority. Specifies that STP funds shall be apportioned in a manner so that a State's current percentage share of apportionments is equal to the State's 1987-91 percentage share of apportionments. Sets forth additional rules with respect to the calculation of a State's percentage share. Directs the Secretary to establish: (1) a congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program; and (2) an interstate maintenance program. Directs the Secretary to set aside: (1) $300,000 for each of specified fiscal years for Operation Lifesaver (a public information and education program to prevent and reduce motor vehicle accidents, injuries, and fatalities and to improve driver performance at railway-highway crossings); and (2) $5,000,000 for railway-highway crossing hazard elimination in high speed rail corridors. Authorizes appropriations under the interstate substitute program for highway and transit projects. Makes funds authorized to be appropriated for substitute transit projects for FY 1993 and 1995 available until expended. (Under current law, such funds are available for the fiscal year for which apportioned or allocated and for the succeeding fiscal year.) Directs the Secretary to permit Federal participation in the initial construction (current law authorizes such participation in construction) and 4R projects (resurfacing, restoring, rehabilitating, and reconstructing) with respect to toll highways, bridges, or tunnels, conversion of toll-free bridges or tunnels to toll facilities, and preliminary studies to determine the feasibility of a toll facility for which Federal participation is authorized on the same basis as Federal participation is permitted in the construction of free highways. Sets forth provisions with respect to ownership of such facilities, limitations on the use of revenues and on the Federal share, modification of agreements to allow Federal participation, and loans by a State of all or part of the Federal share of a toll project to a public or private agency constructing a toll facility. Directs the Secretary to solicit the participation of State and local governments and public authorities for one or more congestion pricing pilot projects. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with as many as five such State or local governments or public authorities to establish, maintain, and monitor such projects. Sets the Federal share payable for such programs at 80 percent. Sets forth: (1) additional funding provisions; and (2) reporting requirements. Eliminates the public operation requirement for toll ferries. Continues existing toll road, bridge, tunnel, and ferry agreements, with specified exceptions. Directs the Secretary, subject to specified circumstances, to void certain agreements with respect to the I-78 Delaware River Bridge. Specifies that the new agreement shall: (1) permit the continuation of tolls without repayment of Federal funds; (2) provide that all toll revenues be used first for repayment of the non-Federal cost of construction of the bridge and second for operation and maintenance costs of the bridge; and (3) permit excess revenues to be used for any other bridge under the jurisdiction of the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission. Directs the Secretary to allocate among the States amounts sufficient to ensure that a State's percentage of the total apportionments in FY 1992 and each fiscal year thereafter and allocations for the prior fiscal year for interstate construction, maintenance, highway substitute, NHS, STP, bridge program, scenic byways, and grants for safety belts and motorcycle helmets shall not be less than 90 percent of the percentage of estimated tax payments attributable to highway users in the State paid into the HTF, other than the Mass Transit Account (MTA), in the latest year for which data is available. Authorizes appropriations out of the HTF (other than the MTA) for the payment of specified donor State bonus amounts for FY 1992 through 1997. Provides that: (1) the bonus apportionments which are provided for a fiscal year (under this title) shall be apportioned in such a way as to bring each successive State or States with the lowest dollar return on dollar projected to be contributed into the HTF for such fiscal year up to the highest common return on contributed dollar that can be funded with the annual authorizations provided under this title; and (2) funds so apportioned shall be available for obligation in the same manner and for the same purposes as if such funds were apportioned for the STP, with exceptions. Provides for reimbursement for segments of the IS constructed without Federal assistance. Authorizes appropriations. Sets forth provisions with respect to: (1) projects in Kansas; and (2) apportionment adjustments. Authorizes appropriations (with respect to the latter). Requires State highway departments to establish the occupancy requirements of vehicles operating in high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, subject to specified limitations.
