    "as": "Conference report filed in House", 
    "date": "1992-10-01", 
    "text": "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 - Division A: Department of Defense Authorizations - Title I: Procurement - Subtitle A: Funding Authorizations - Authorizes appropriations to the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force for FY 1993 for: (1) aircraft; (2) missiles; (3) weapons and tracked combat vehicles; (4) ammunition; (5) shipbuilding and conversion; and (6) other procurement. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 for: (1) the defense agencies; (2) the Defense Inspector General; (3) the reserves and National Guard; and (4) the chemical demilitarization program. Authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to use funds authorized under this Act to enter into multiyear procurement contracts for the procurement of satellites under the Defense Support Program. Subtitle B: Army Programs - Prohibits the use of any funds appropriated for the Army for FY 1991 or 1992 from being used to initiate or implement closure of any portion of the tank industrial base. Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 to revise the amount authorized under such Act for the remanufacture of M1 tanks to the M1A2 configuration. States that a prior-law prohibition against the obligation of funding for the procurement of AHIP Scout aircraft (Army helicopters) shall not apply to the obligation of specified FY 1993 funding for the procurement of up to 36 of such aircraft. Repeals a provision of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 which imposed certain restrictions on the modification of AH-64 Apache helicopters. Authorizes the use of funds received from the sales of tanks, infantry vehicles, or armored personnel carriers by the United States under the Arms Export Control Act after FY 1989 to upgrade such armored vehicles for fielding to the Army. Prohibits the Improved Chemical Agent Monitor from being procured for the armed forces until the Secretary of the Army completes certain testing and congressional notification with respect to such program. Subtitle C: Navy Programs - Earmarks shipbuilding and conversion funds authorized under this Act for specified ship replacement, overhaul, and conversion programs within the Navy. Prohibits the use of funds made available by this or any earlier Act from being used for the procurement of the Airborne Self Protection Jammer, except for the payment of termination costs for existing contracts. Makes such prohibition effective when the Secretary of Defense notifies the Senate and House Armed Services and Appropriations Committee (defense committees) that such Jammer has been determined operationally ineffective or unsuitable in testing. Prohibits the use of FY 1993 Department of Defense (DOD) funds for the AV-8 radar upgrade program or the installation of new fuselages in such radar aircraft. Subtitle D: Air Force Programs (Nonstrategic) - Earmarks specified FY 1993 Air Force funds for the modification of C-135 aircraft. Considers the C-17 transport aircraft a covered system for purposes of survivability testing requirements (requiring certain survivability testing before full-scale production is permitted). Authorizes the Secretary to waive such testing requirements with respect to the C-17. Requires certain alternative live-fire testing if the Secretary certifies that survivability testing would be unreasonably expensive or impractical. Directs the Secretary of the Air Force to certify to the defense committees that the repair of fuel leaks on production C-17 aircraft will be carried out by the contractor at no additional cost to the Government. Provides an alternative to such certification. Earmarks specified FY 1993 Air Force funds for procurement of C-17 aircraft, including advance procurement. Prohibits the obligation of any such funds other than for advance procurement before the Secretary submits a report to the defense committees required under prior law. Prohibits the obligation of any FY 1994 funding available for such aircraft until the Secretary, the Secretary of the Air Force, and the Defense Acquisition Board take certain action or submit required reports with respect to the acquisition and testing of such aircraft. Prohibits current C-17 funds from being used to increase the current rate for producing such aircraft. Directs the Secretary to establish an initiative to maintain control over costs, contractor performance, and management performance within the C-17 aircraft program. Directs the Secretary to report to the defense committees on such initiative. Prohibits FY 1993 procurement funding for such aircraft from being obligated until the Secretary makes certain certifications to the defense committees with respect to the production and assembly of such aircraft. Prohibits more than 65 percent of the funds made available to DOD for FY 1993 for a specified Air Force electronic system improvement program from being obligated until the Secretary make certain determination and submits certain reports. Prohibits the obligation of any funds made available during FY 1993 for the F-16 aircraft program for any purposes other than production until the Secretary reports to the Congress concerning such aircraft. Subtitle E: Defense-Wide Programs - Earmarks specified funds from this Act for modernizing either EP-e Aries or RC-135 Rivet Joint aircraft. Prohibits the obligation of such funds to the Navy until the Secretary determines which of such aircraft best meets the intelligence requirements of DOD and notifies the defense committees, along with other specified information. Provides for the transfer of funds to such aircraft after such determination and notification. Requires operational test and evaluation and survivability testing of certain helicopter programs to be completed prior to their release for operational use. Subtitle F: Strategic Programs - Earmarks specified Air Force procurement funds under this Act for procurement for the B-2 bomber aircraft program, limiting the deployment of such aircraft to 20 plus one test aircraft. Limits the obligation of funds for such aircraft until the Secretary has made certain reports and certifications to the defense committees with respect to the performance and survivability assessment of such aircraft, as well as total costs. Directs the Secretary to: (1) prepare a plan to evaluate heavy bombers (other than the B-2) test ranges and facilities to demonstrate their effectiveness in preparing for heavy bomber missions; (2) assess the current capability of DOD to carry out survivability and operational flight testing of heavy bombers against targets that represent a broad array of potential defenses that such bombers might encounter during the next 20 years; (3) report to the defense committees the plan and the assessment; and (4) have such report reviewed and updated by the Comptroller General within 60 days after submission. Subtitle G: Chemical Demilitarization Program - Amends the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1986 to extend through December 31, 2004, the deadline for the elimination of the existing stockpile by DOD of lethal chemicals agents and munitions. Directs the Secretary of the Army to establish a Chemical Demilitarization Citizens' Advisory Commission for each State in which there is a low-volume chemical weapons storage site. Requires a representative of the Assistant Secretary of the Army to meet with each Commission to receive citizen and State concerns with respect to Army disposal of lethal chemical agents and munitions. Establishes Commission membership and conflict-of-interests requirements. Terminates each Commission after that State's chemical weapons stockpile has been destroyed. Directs the Secretary of the Army to report to the Congress on the potential alternatives to the use of the Army's baseline disassembly and incineration process for the disposal of lethal chemical agents and munitions. Prohibits the Secretary from commencing site preparation for, or construction of, a facility for such disassembly and incineration until such report is submitted, unless such site preparation or construction has commenced before the enactment of this Act. Provides exceptions to such limitation. Directs the Secretary of the Army to carry out the disposal of chemical agents and munitions at a low-volume site using an alternative disposal technology process if it is determined to be significantly safer and cost-effective and can occur within the deadline of December 31, 2004. Directs such Secretary, if such alternative disposal process is utilized, to report to the Congress a revised chemical weapons disposal concept plan incorporating the alternative technology process. Provides a submission date and limitations with respect to such revised concept plan. Directs the Secretary of the Army to report to the Congress the Army's plan for destroying all chemical warfare material of the United States that would be required to be destroyed if the United States became a party to a specified chemical weapons international convention. Directs the Secretary of the Army to report to the Congress on the physical and chemical integrity of the existing chemical weapons that are contained in the U.S. stockpile and stored within eight storage sites in the continental United States. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of State, should establish with the Secretary of State, should establish with other party nations to an international agreement banning chemical weapons, a program under which consultation and exchange concerning chemical weapons disposal technology could be enhanced. Subtitle H: Armament Retooling and Manufacturing Support Initiative - Armament Retooling and Manufacturing Support Act of 1992 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Army, during FY 1993 and 1994, to carry out a program to be known as the Armament Retooling and Manufacturing Support Initiative (ARMS Initiative). States as some of the purposes of the ARMS Initiative: (1) encouraging commercial firms to use Government-owned, contractor-operated Army ammunition manufacturing facilities for commercial purposes; (2) increasing the opportunities for small and socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses to use such facilities for such purposes; (3) reducing through the provision of new jobs and retraining the adverse effects of reduced Army expenditures and the closing of such facilities; and (4) engaging in other defense conversion initiatives and activities which contribute to economic stability. Directs such Secretary to make such Government-owned, contractor-operated Army manufacturing facilities available for the purposes stated.
