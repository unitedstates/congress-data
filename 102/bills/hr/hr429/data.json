    "text": "Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 - Title I: Buffalo Bill Dam and Reservoir, Wyoming - Revises existing law to require as a principal modification to the Buffalo Bill Dam and Reservoir, Wyoming, the construction of power generating facilities with a total installed capacity of 25.5 megawatts. Authorizes the construction of recreational facilities in excess of the amount required to replace or relocate existing facilities. Provides that the costs of such construction shall be borne equally by the United States and Wyoming. Repeals a prior authorization of appropriations and authorizes to be appropriated for the Federal share of the construction of the Buffalo Bill Dam and Reservoir modifications and recreational facilities the sum of $80,000,000 (October 1988 price levels). Repeals a requirement that such sums authorized to be appropriated for construction, operation, maintenance, and replacement be reduced by the amounts of certain contributions. Authorizes appropriations for increased costs of construction attributable to delays in authorizations for the Dam and Reservoir. Title II: Central Utah Project Construction - Designates titles II through VI as the Central Utah Project Completion Act. Authorizes additional appropriations for the Colorado River water storage project (CRSP), to be available solely for design, engineering, and construction of the facilities identified in this title, the planning and implementation of certain fish and wildlife and recreation mitigation and conservation projects and studies, and the Ute Indian Rights Settlement authorized under this Act. Requires the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) to implement specified recommendations prepared by the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior with respect to the financial management of the CRSP. Earmarks specified amounts of such additional funds for various reclamation projects and features within Utah. Permits counties in which such projects and features were proposed to be located to participate in certain local development projects. Provides for the termination of the authorization of appropriations for construction of any CRSP participating project located in Utah five years after the enactment of this Act unless the Secretary: (1) executes a cost-sharing agreement with non-Federal entities for construction of such project; and (2) has requested, or the Congress has appropriated, construction funds for such project. Directs the Secretary to: (1) make appropriated funds available in their entirety to non-Federal interests as provided for pursuant to the provisions of this Act; and (2) report to the Congress on the status of CRSP participating projects for which construction has not begun as of October 15, 1990. Makes specified amounts available, subject to certain restrictions, for features of the Bonneville Unit of the Central Utah Project (CUP), including: (1) an irrigation and drainage system; (2) a feasibility study and development of systems to allow groundwater recharge, management, and the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources; (3) a feasibility study of efficiency improvements in the management, delivery, and treatment of water in Wasatch County; (4) a feasibility study to reduce the salinity of Utah Lake; (5) a hydrologic model analysis study of the Provo River Basin and a feasibility study of direct delivery of Colorado River Basin water from the Strawberry Reservoir or elsewhere in the Strawberry Collection System to the Provo River Basin, and evaluating the potential for changes in existing importation patterns and quantities of water from the Weber and Duchesne River Basins; and (6) completing construction of the Diamond Fork System. Directs the Secretary, in exchange for and as a precondition to approval of the Strawberry Water Users Association's petition for Bonneville Unit water, to impose conditions on such approval so as to ensure that the Association manages and develops specified lands in a manner compatible with the management and improvement of adjacent Federal lands for wildlife purposes, natural values, and recreation. Prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary from permitting commercial or other development of specified Federal lands. Authorizes the Secretary to use specified Federal funds for engineering, design, and construction of Hatchtown dam in Garfield County and for associated facilities to deliver supplemental project water from the dam.

Sets forth various requirements and restrictions on, and provisions setting conditions for the termination of authorizations for, the Bonneville Unit water development and the Uinta Basin replacement project. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) contract with the Uintah Water Conservancy District for the retention by the United States of responsibility for part of the municipal and industrial water obligation with a corresponding part of the water supply to be controlled and marketed by the United States in conformance with State law; and (2) establish a conservation pool of 4,000 acre feet in Red Fleet Reservoir to enhance associated fishery and recreational opportunities and for other purposes recommended by the Commission, and enter into an agreement with the Utah Division of Parks and Recreation for the management and operation of Red Fleet recreational facilities. Requires that the non-Federal share of the costs for the design, engineering, and construction of the Bonneville Unit water development and the Uinta Basin replacement project be 35 percent and 50 percent for the specified feasibility studies. Specifies that the District may commence such studies prior to entering into binding agreements and upon execution of such agreements the Secretary shall reimburse the District an amount equal to the Federal share of the funds expended by the District. Prohibits the obligation or expenditure of federally appropriated funds for such development and project, with exceptions, until: (1) the Central Utah Water Conservancy District (the District) completes a Definite Plan Report for the Bonneville Unit and a feasibility study for the Uinta project; (2) the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 have been satisfied; and (3) a plan has been developed and approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to prevent any harmful contamination of waters due to concentrations of selenium or other such toxicants, if the Service determines that development of the particular system may result in contamination. Bars the provision of Federal funds under this Act to any non-Federal interest until any such interest enters into a binding agreement with the appropriate Federal authority to be considered a \"Federal agency\" for purposes of compliance with all Federal fish, wildlife, recreation, and environmental laws with respect to the use of such funds, and to comply with this Act. Requires the District, at the option of specified eligible counties, to rebate to such counties all ad valorem tax contributions paid by such counties to the District, with interest but less the value of any benefits received by such counties and less the administrative expenses incurred by the District to that date. Directs the Secretary, upon request of eligible counties that elect not to participate in the project, to provide as grants to such counties sums for potable water distribution and treatment, wastewater collection and treatment, agricultural water management, and other public infrastructure improvements approved by the Secretary. Bars the use of available funds for the draining of wetlands, the dredging of natural water courses, and planning or constructing water impoundments of greater than 5,000 acre feet, with exceptions. Requires the District to: (1) prepare and maintain a comprehensive water management improvement plan, including specified water conservation goals and providing for a water management improvement inventory; (2) establish a continuous process for the identification, evaluation, and implementation of water conservation measures, and submit a report thereon to the Secretary; (3) prepare and transmit to the Secretary a study of wholesale and retail pricing to encourage water conservation, and a study of the coordinated operation of independent municipal, industrial, and irrigation water systems; and (4) evaluate cost-effective, flexible operating procedures that will serve specified purposes, including improving the availability and reliability of the water supply, coordinating the timing of reservoir releases, assisting in managing drought emergencies, and encouraging the maintenance of existing wells and other facilities which may be placed on standby status when water deliveries from the project become available. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the Governor of Utah (or, if the Governor fails to do so, directs the Secretary) to establish the Utah Water Conservation Advisory Baord. Directs the Board to recommend water conservation standards and regulations for promulgation by State or local authorities in the service area of each petitioner of project water. Requires the District to pay a surcharge for each year of substantial noncompliance according to a specified formula. Sets forth provisions with respect to: (1) judicial review; (2) citizen suits; (3) jurisdiction and venue; and (4) costs awarded by the Court. Requires that hydropower generation facilities associated with the CUP operate in accordance with a specified statute. Prohibits the diversion of Colorado River Basin waters exclusively for power generation purposes. Requires the District to utilize its best efforts to achieving operating agreements with the Jordanelle Reservoir, Deer Creek Reservoir, Utah Lake, and Strawberry Reservoir. Authorizes the prepayment of certain expenses in connection with the Jordan Aqueduct System. Requires the Comptroller General to audit project cost allocations among the various project purposes and submit a report to the Secretary and to the Congress. Grants the Secretary authority to reallocate project costs and to defer repayment of such costs under certain circumstances. Directs the Secretary to impose a surcharge for the use of CUP water used in the production of any commodity crop for which an acreage reduction program is in effect under provisions of the Agricultural Act of 1949 if the stocks of such commodity held in storage by the Commodity Credit Corporation exceed an amount that the Secretary of Agriculture determines is necessary to provide for a reserve of such commodity that can reasonably be expected to meet a shortage caused by drought, natural disaster, or other disruption in the supply of such commodity until the construction costs of certain facilities authorized by this Act are repaid. Title III: Fish, Wildlife, and Recreation Mitigation and Conservation - Establishes the Utah Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Commission to coordinate the implementation of the mitigation and conservation provisions of this Act among the Federal and State fish, wildlife, and recreation agencies. Requires the Commission to complete certain plans and submit specified reports. Provides funding for the Commission. Directs the District to acquire, with funds provided by the Commission, specified water rights in the Utah Lake drainage basin. Earmarks specified funds for such acquisition. Specifies that water purchases which would have the effect of compromising groundwater resources or dewatering agricultural lands in the Upper Provo River areas should be avoided. Provides all water rights after such acquisition to the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources for maintaining certain instream flows for fish, wildlife, and recreation purposes in the Provo River. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the District, annually, to provide amounts of water sufficient to sustain minimum stream flows established pursuant to a prior Stream Flow Agreement. Directs the District to acquire with Commission funds all of the Strawberry Basin water rights being diverted to the Heber Valley through the Daniel's Creek drainage and to apply such rights to increase the minimum stream flows of streams and rivers in the Strawberry River and Reservoir area. Earmarks funds for such acquisition. Bars the District from leasing water from the Daniels Creek Irrigation Company before the beginning of FY 1993.
