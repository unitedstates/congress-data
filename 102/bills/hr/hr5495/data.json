    "text": "National Institutes of Health Revitalization Amendments of 1992 - Title I: General Provisions Regarding title IV of Public Health Service Act - Subtitle A: Research Freedom - Part I: Review of Proposals for Biomedical and Behavioral Research - Amends the Public Health Service Act to prohibit the Secretary of Health and Human Services from approving certain research or financial assistance to conduct research unless specified review has taken place and the review entity has recommended approval. Prohibits the Secretary from withholding, on ethical grounds, funding for research that has received such review approval unless: (1) an ethics advisory board recommends the withholding; or (2) such a board recommends against withholding, but the Secretary finds that the recommendation is arbitrary and capricious. Part II: Research on Transplantation of Fetal Tissue - Permits the Secretary to conduct or support research on the transplantation of human fetal tissue for therapeutic purposes regardless of whether the tissue is obtained from a spontaneous or induced abortion or a stillbirth, in accordance with State and local law.
