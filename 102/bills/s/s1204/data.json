    "date": "1991-06-19", 
    "text": "Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 Title I: - Part A: General Provisions - Declares that: (1) the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways is completed; (2) the principal purpose of Federal highway assistance shall henceforth be to improve the efficiency of the existing surface transportation system; and (3) it is U.S. policy to facilitate innovation and competition in transportation modes through Federal and State initiative, and to increase productivity in the transportation sector of the economy through systematic attention to costs and benefits. Directs the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to distribute copies of the Declaration of Policy to each employee of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and to ensure that such Declaration is posted in all FHWA offices. Authorizes appropriations out of the Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) for the following programs: (1) surface transportation; (2) congestion mitigation and air quality improvement; (3) bridges; (4) interstate maintenance; (5) interstate construction (but repeals the existing FY 1993 authorization and a provision regarding minimum apportionments); (6) interstate substitution; (7) Federal lands highway; (8) territorial highway; (9) national magnetic levitation design; (10) FHWA research; (11) university transportation center; (12) highway use tax evasion; and (13) safety belt and motorcycle helmet use. Sets forth provisions with respect to obligation ceilings for Federal-aid highway programs, redistribution of unused obligation authority, and specified limitations. Directs the Secretary to establish a surface transportation program (STP) to fund projects such as: (1) construction, restoration, and operational improvement for highways and bridges, including the seismic retrofit, painting of, and application of calcium magnesium acetate on bridges and other elevated structures; (2) capital costs for mass transit, passenger rail, operating costs for passenger rail for States without Amtrak service as of the date of enactment of this Act, publicly owned intra- or inter-city bus terminals and facilities, and magnetic levitation systems; (3) carpool projects and parking and bicycle facilities and programs; (4) safety improvements and programs; (5) research and development; (6) transportation control measures under the Clean Air Act (CAA); and (7) incremental costs attributable to the use of alternative fuels by school buses; and (8) other purposes approved by the Secretary. Authorizes the use of STP funds to mitigate wetland loss related to, and to conserve and restore wetlands adversely affected by, highway construction, subject to specified limitations. Requires that 75 percent of STP funds be divided, based on their relative share of the State's population, between regions consisting of areas of the State with a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) population of over 250,000 and all other areas of the State. Authorizes the distribution of the remaining 25 percent to any area of the State. Makes such requirements inapplicable to any State which is noncontiguous with the continental United States. Specifies that at least eight percent of the funds apportioned to a State must be reprogrammed for transportation enhancement activities. Specifies that: (1) the Federal share for projects under the STP is 80 percent, unless funds apportioned are used to construct new facilities or expand existing facilities available primarily to single-occupant vehicles (SOVs), in which case the Federal share is 75 percent; and (2) if the State constructs a facility not available to SOVs and subsequently makes the facility available to such vehicles, the State must repay with interest the increase in the Federal share of the project. Sets forth additional administrative requirements, including the requirement that the State submit an annual certification that it will meet all the requirements of this Act. Requires: (1) the State to notify the Secretary of the amount of obligations it plans to incur for STP projects during the fiscal year; and (2) the Secretary to use estimates prepared by the Secretary of Commerce when determining population figures. Provides for an energy conservation, congestion mitigation, and clean air bonus program. Specifies that, beginning in FY 1993, for States with one or more MSAs with a population of 250,000 or more: (1) the amount of each State's STP funds shall be reduced by a factor of .9 if the State's vehicle miles of travel (VMT) per capita is more than 110 percent of its VMT in the base year (defined as 1990 for FY 1993 through 1995, and 1995 for subsequent fiscal years); and (2) such reductions in apportionments shall be placed in a Surface Transportation Bonus Fund to be used to increase the amount of STP funds by a factor of 1.1 for each affected State if such State's VMT per capita is less than 90 percent of its VMT per capita in the base year. Specifies that the Federal share of capital projects that add capacity available to SOVs shall be 75 percent and for all other projects, including projects for high occupancy vehicles (HOVs) that permit SOV use during the off-peak periods, shall be 80 percent of construction costs. Directs the Secretary to develop and make available to the States guidance on how to determine what portion of a project qualifies for an 80 percent Federal share. Repeals a provision authorizing the Secretary to approve as a project on any Federal-aid system the construction of exclusive or preferential truck lanes. Authorizes: (1) the Secretary to establish a congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program; and (2) funds under such program to be spent on projects that will contribute to attainment of air quality standards as determined by the guidance to be issued under the CAA by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (with exceptions), a State implementation under such Act, or the Secretary. Provides for the apportionment of funds to States based on their non-attainment area population, adjusted for the severity of the non-attainment problem. Specifies that the Federal/State match shall be 80/20. Makes apportionments under this Act available in nonattainment areas, with urbanized populations over 50,000 receiving funds in proportion to their relative share of weighted nonattainment area population. Specifies minimum apportionments for States subject to specified air pollution control measures. Specifies that the Federal/State match to repair or replace existing bridges without increasing capacity shall be 80/20, but the match for construction of new capacity on existing bridges or construction of new bridges shall be 75/25 (currently, the match is 80/20 in any case). Makes bridge painting, seismic retrofit, and maintenance eligible uses of Federal funds. Repeals the discretionary bridge program. Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop and make available to the States criteria for determining what share of a project is attributable to the expansion of bridge capacity where the new capacity is available to SOVs; and (2) establish \"level of service\" criteria for the bridge program. Authorizes the transfer of up to 60 percent of the apportionment of bridge program funds to either the STP or the interstate maintenance program, subject to specified conditions. Bars the use of interstate maintenance funds to expand the capacity of any interstate highway or bridge where such new capacity consists of one or more new travel lanes that are not HOV or auxiliary lanes. Authorizes the States to transfer to the STP up to 20 percent of interstate maintenance money and larger amounts if a State can demonstrate to the Secretary that it is adequately maintaining its interstate highways. Changes the Federal/State match for interstate maintenance from 90/10 to 80/20. Authorizes the Secretary to develop and make available to the States criteria for determining: (1) the share of a interstate maintenance project that is attributable to the expansion of the capacity of an interstate highway; and (2) what constitutes adequate maintenance. Specifies that segments added to Interstate System (ISS) before January 1, 1984, shall be counted towards a State apportionment of interstate maintenance funds. Directs the Secretary to make apportionments to the States to finish outstanding projects, except that specific amounts are specified for Massachusetts. Combines the public lands highways and forest highways accounts of the current Federal lands program. Provides for the apportionment of funds based on the existing formula for the forest highways program. Makes funds available for each class of Federal lands highways available for transportation planning for tourism and recreational travel, interpretive signage, acquisition of scenic or historic sites, provision for pedestrians and bicycles, construction and reconstruction of roadside rest areas, and other appropriate public road facilities as determined by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to transfer to the Secretary of the Interior from the appropriation for public lands highways amounts as necessary to cover administrative costs of the Bureau of Land Management in connection with public lands highways. Increases from $15,000 to $50,000 the threshold for construction costs of forest development roads and trails in determining whether to advertise and let a contract or have the work done by the Secretary of Agriculture. Requires that $20,000,000 be made available for FY 1992 through 1996 for continued rehabilitation of federally-owned highways under the Federal lands highway program. Authorizes the use of funds allocated for Indian reservation roads to fund road projects on roads of tribally controlled postsecondary and vocational institutions. Specifies that two percent of funds allocated for Indian reservation roads shall be allocated to those Indian tribal governments applying for transportation planning pursuant to the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act. Directs the Indian tribal government to develop a transportation improvement program (TIP). Specifies that projects shall be selected by the Indian tribal government from the TIP and be subject to the approval of the Secretary and the Secretary of the Interior. Repeals the current national policy against tolls on roads built or maintained with Federal funds. Authorizes the use of Federal funds, with exceptions, to: (1) build new toll roads at a 35/65 Federal/non-Federal cost share; and (2) convert existing non-tolled facilities to toll facilities at an 80/20 cost share. Prohibits the imposition of new tolls on the IS. Authorizes the Secretary to permit Federal participation in the construction of ferryboats and ferry approaches, subject to specified conditions. Directs the Secretary to solicit participation of State and local governments and public authorities for one or more congestion pricing pilot projects. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with up to five such State or local governments or public authorities to establish, maintain, and monitor congestion pricing projects. Specifies the Federal share (100 percent for not more than three years). Directs the Secretary to fund all development and startup costs of such projects for at least one year and thereafter until sufficient revenues are generated by the program to fund its operating costs without Federal participation. Sets forth monitoring and reporting requirements. Directs the Secretary to renegotiate specified agreements to permit the continuance of existing toll facilities without repayment of Federal funds, with exceptions. Requires (currently, authorizes) the designation of a metropolitan planning organization (MPO) for each urbanized area of a State over 50,000 population within any State by agreement among the Governor and the units of general purpose local government. Requires that: (1) MPOs in existence on or before October 1, 1991, be considered so designated; and (2) representative portions of multi-State metropolitan areas, where feasible, provide for coordinated transportation planning for the entire metropolitan area by adopting a single TIP for such area. Authorizes the Governor of any State to enter into such agreements as necessary with the Governor of any other State to provide for comprehensive multi-State transportation planning for metropolitan areas that encompass portions of more than one State. Specifies that: (1) plans developed by an MPO shall take into account the requirements of the CAA, local land use or energy plans, and other factors, such as the need for connectivity of roads within the metropolitan area with those outside such area; and (2) the MPO shall develop a TIP that is consistent with the long range transportation plan developed by the MPO, that conforms with the applicable State implementation plan developed pursuant to the CAA, and that includes a priority list of projects to be carried out within three years after initial adoption of the program. Sets forth provisions with respect to the selection of projects. Increases the current Federal set-aside for metropolitan planning from .5 to one percent of Federal highway funds. Requires each State to have management systems for bridges, pavement, safety, and congestion and a traffic monitoring system, as well as a planning process that takes into account land use, energy requirements, transportation needs, and other factors. Requires States that contain non-attainment areas under the CAA to produce an annual State transportation plan, incorporating without amendment the provisions of any metropolitan area plan developed pursuant to this Act. Directs the FHWA to conduct research on Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems (IVHS) and other new technologies and to develop indicators to measure the performance of the surface transportation system with respect to productivity, efficiency, energy use, air quality, and other factors. Directs the Secretary to create and administer a Dwight D. Eisenhower transportation research fellowship program. Directs the Secretary, the governors of Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas, and appropriate representatives of Mexico to assess the need for transportation infrastructure to facilitate trade between the United States and Mexico. Directs the Secretary the governors of specified States bordering Canada, and appropriate representatives of Canada to assess the need for transportation infrastructure to facilitate trade between the United States and Canada. Sets forth reporting requirements. Changes the Federal/State match for State research activities from 85/15 to 80/20. Allows States to program research funds without approval of the Department of Transportation (DOT). Establishes within DOT a Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) which shall be responsible for: (1) compiling, analyzing, and publishing a comprehensive set of transportation statistics, including information such as productivity in the various portions of the transportation sectors, traffic flows, vehicle weights, travel costs, availability of mass transit, accidents, and collateral environmental damages; (2) promulgating guidelines for the collection of information; (3) coordinating such collection with related information-gathering activities conducted by other Federal agencies; (4) making readily accessible the statistics published under this title; and (5) identifying missing information, reviewing information needs at least annually, and making recommendations to the appropriate DOT research officials concerning research programs. Requires the Director of BTS to: (1) pursue a comprehensive, long-term program for the collection and analysis of data relating to the performance of the national transportation system; (2) submit annually a Transportation Statistics Annual Report; and (3) appoint an Advisory Council on Transportation Statistics. Requires the Secretary, within one year, to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences for a study, evaluation, and report of the adequacy of the data collection procedures and capabilities of DOT. Directs the Secretary and the Director of BTS: (1) within three months, to undertake a comprehensive study of the most appropriate and accurate methods of calculating State levels of effort in funding STPS; and (2) within nine months, to provide a written report to specified congressional committees detailing the findings of the study and recommendations. Directs the Administrator of the FHWA to: (1) conduct fundamental chemical and physical property studies of petroleum and modified asphalts used in highway construction in the United States with the primary emphasis of prediction of pavement performance; (2) contract with a non-profit organization with demonstrated expertise in research associated in such areas to undertake the necessary technical and analytical research in coordination with existing programs; and (3) implement a test strip to demonstrate and evaluate unique energy and environmental advantages of the use of shale oil modified asphalts under extreme climate conditions. Authorizes appropriations. Sets forth reporting requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) undertake, on a cost-shared basis, collaborative research and development with non-Federal entities; and (2) enter into a cooperative research and development agreement. Specifies that the average Federal share in such agreements shall not exceed 50 percent, except that where there is substantial public interest or benefit the Secretary may approve a higher Federal level of participation. Specifies that: (1) cooperative research and development agreements shall recognize all directly related costs to the non-Federal partners, including personnel, travel, and hardware development; and (2) the research, development, or utilization of any technology pursuant to such an agreement shall be subject to provisions of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980. Establishes a national magnetic levitation design program to be managed jointly by the Secretary of DOT and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. Requires such officials to establish a National Maglev Joint Project Office to carry out such program and to solicit bids from the private sector to design and construct a prototype magnetic levitation system. Requires the Secretary and Assistant Secretary to develop a national strategic plan for the design and construction of a national magnetic levitation surface transportation system, which shall include consideration of other modes of high speed surface transportation, such as high speed rail. Requires the plan to be completed and transmitted to specified congressional committees within 18 months. Specifies that: (1) phase one grants shall be given to up to six applicants to develop a conceptual design for the system at a 90/10 cost share; (2) phase two grants shall be given to up to three participants to develop detailed plans at an 80/20 cost share (and a contract for construction awarded at 75/25 cost share); and (3) the prototype shall be constructed and ready for operational testing within three years after the award of the grant and shall be converted to commercial operation after testing is complete. Directs the Secretary, in any case where sufficient land exists within the publicly acquired rights-of-way of any highway constructed in whole or in part with Federal-aid highway funds to accommodate needed passenger or commuter high speed ground transportation (including magnetic levitation) systems and highway and non-highway public mass transit facilities, to authorize a State to make such lands and rights-of-way available without charge to a publicly or privately owned authority or company for such purposes. (Under current law, the Administrator may make such authorization to a publicly owned mass transit authority when in the public interest with respect to rights-of-way of a Federal-aid highway to accommodate needed rail or nonhighway public mass transit facilities where this can be accomplished without impairing automotive safety or future highway improvements.) Makes a provision providing the States with a right to income from airspace rights-of-way contingent upon such States' permitting governmental use, use by public or private entities for high speed ground transportation systems, or other transit, utility use, and occupancy where such or occupancy is necessary for an authorized transportation project, or use for transportation projects eligible for assistance, without charge. Directs the Secretary, by October 1, 1993, to update the findings of the report required by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 to determine the amount the United States could pay the States to reimburse them for segments incorporated into the IS that were constructed at non-Federal expenses. Continues current law with respect to disadvantaged business enterprises. Modifies the dollar amount used to define a small business to adjust for inflation. Directs the Comptroller General of the United States to: (1) conduct a study of the disadvantaged business enterprise program; and (2) submit a report on the findings of such study, within 12 months, to specified congressional committees. Makes funds under Federal highway provisions available in the year in which they are apportioned or allocated and in the next three years. Directs the Secretary to set aside $200,000,000 for interstate discretionary projects. Requires that: (1) all STP projects be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in accordance with applicable State requirements; and (2) the design and construction standards adopted by States for projects on principal arterials be those approved by the Secretary in cooperation with State highway departments and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. Authorizes any State to request that the Secretary no longer review and approve design and construction standards for any project other than a project on an interstate highway or other multi-lane access control highways. Directs the Secretary, after receiving any such request, to undertake project review only as requested by the State, provided that such State complies with the requirements of all other applicable Federal laws and regulations. Authorizes a State highway or transportation department to establish maintenance standards for projects constructed pursuant to Federal highway provisions, subject to annual approval by the Secretary (which may not be withheld if a State is meeting its own standards for routine maintenance). Requires such department to establish the occupancy requirements of vehicles operating in HOV lanes, but requires no fewer than two occupants for such lanes. Specifies that, for purposes of this Act, motorcycles and bicycles shall not be considered SOVs and that nothing in this Act alters the requirement that each State allow the operation of motorcycles in HOV lanes unless the State certifies that such operation would create a safety hazard. Requires a State to repay all Federal funds for preliminary engineering for any project that has not advanced to construction or acquisition of right-of-way within ten years of receipt of such funds. Specifies that projects that affect historic and scenic values may be designed to protect such values. Requires States that do not adopt laws mandating the use of safety belts and motorcycle helmets to set aside a portion of funds received under the STP for highway safety programs (1.5 percent for noncompliance in FY 1994 and three percent thereafter). Authorizes the Secretary to make grants for safety education, training, monitoring, and enforcement to States that adopt safety belt and helmet laws. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study of restrained and unrestrained individuals injured in motor vehicle crashes and of helmetted and non-helmetted motorcyclists injured in motorcycle crashes, collecting and analyzing data from regional trauma systems regarding differences in: (1) the severity of injuries; and (2) acute, rehabilitative, and long-term costs; and (3) mortality and morbidity outcomes. Makes $5,000,000 available to carry out provisions regarding safety belt and motorcycle helmet use. Requires the Secretary to report the results of such study to the Congress within 40 months. Allows a State to use as a credit toward meeting non-Federal matching requirements non-Federal capital expenditures on facilities that serve interstate commerce, provided such State maintains its aggregate non-Federal transportation capital spending at a level at or above the average of such spending for the preceding three fiscal years. Specifies that use of such credit shall not expose public, quasi-public, or private agencies from which the credit is calculated to any additional Federal oversight, regulation, or liability. Increases the period within which construction must be commenced on a right-of-way funded from the right-of-way revolving fund from ten to 20 years. Authorizes Federal reimbursement of a State for costs to acquire rights-of-way in advance of Federal approval or authorization and land necessary to preserve environmental and scenic values if specified conditions are met. Eliminates the requirement that right-of-way revolving fund advances be for projects on the Federal-aid system. Directs the Secretary to submit to the Congress a study of alternative transportation modes for use in the National Park System, considering economic and technical feasibility, environmental effects, projected costs and benefits, general suitability of transportation modes, and methods to obtain private capital for construction. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Secretary to revise the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices to include a standard for a minimum level of retroreflectivity that must be maintained for pavement markings and signs and a standard to define the functional classification of roads that must have a center line, edge lines, or both. Bars the Secretary from making grants under Federal highway provisions to States that fail to provide certification that the asphalt pavement laid in the State in a given year, which was financed in whole or in part by such grants, satisfies the minimum utilization requirement for asphalt rubber pavement (ARP) established by this title. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) modify the minimum utilization requirement for ARP during a phase-in period if the Secretary determines that such a period is necessary to develop production and application facilities for ARP (but limits such period to six years after the enactment of this Act); and (2) increase the minimum utilization requirement for ARP to be used in federally-assisted highway projects to the extent technologically and economically feasible if appropriate to assure markets for the reuse and recycling of scrap tires. Authorizes the Secretary to set aside such provisions for any three-year period based on a determination that there is reliable evidence indicating that manufacture, application, and use of ARP substantially increases risks to human health or the environment as compared to the risks associated with conventional pavement, that ARP cannot be recycled to the same degree as conventional pavement, or that ARP does not perform adequately as a material for the construction or surfacing of highways and roads. Specifies that any such determination may be made for specific States or regions considering climate, geography, and other factors unique to the State or region and that would prevent the adequate performance of ARP in such State or region. Sets the minimum utilization requirement for ARP in federally-assisted highway projects at not less than an average of six pounds of rubber derived from scrap tires for each one ton of finished asphalt pavement used in such projects in the State. Authorizes the Secretary to grant a State credit toward the minimum utilization requirement for volumes of ARP used in other road and construction projects and for ARP containing rubber at rates less than or greater than six pounds per ton, subject to specified requirements. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a minimum utilization requirement for ARP less than the minimum otherwise required in a particular State, upon the request of the State, if the Secretary determines that there is not a sufficient quantity of scrap tires available prior to disposal in the State to meet the minimum utilization requirement and each of the other recycling and processing uses for which scrap tires are required; and (2) conduct a program of research to determine the public health and environmental risks associated with the production and use of ARP, the performance of the ARP under various climate and use conditions, and the degree to which ARP can be recycled. Expands projects eligible for right-of-way revolving fund advances to include passenger rail facilities. Creates a national scenic and historic byways program and an Office of Scenic and Historic Byways within the FHWA. Directs: (1) such Office to provide technical assistance to the State and grants for the planning, design, and development of State scenic byway programs; and (2) the Secretary to establish criteria for roads to be designated as part of an All American Roads program, designate such roads, and establish criteria for the allocation of funds to the States. Authorizes appropriations.

Requires each MPO to prepare for its metropolitan area a metropolitan transportation strategy that at a minimum: (1) identifies transportation facilities (including major roadways, mass transit, and multimodal and intermodal facilities) that should function as an integrated metropolitan transportation system, especially those facilities serving specified national and regional transportation functions; (2) assesses major demands on the metropolitan transportation system (projected over the subsequent 20-year period); (3) sets forth a long-range strategy for meeting metropolitan area personal mobility and goods transportation needs; (4) explains how proposed transportation decisions will achieve compliance with environmental and resource conservation laws, further Federal, State, and local energy conservation programs, and affect other objectives such as housing, community development, and historic preservation; (5) includes a financial plan demonstrating how such strategy can be implemented; (6) projects capital investment and other measures to ensure the preservation and most efficient use of existing transportation facilities; and (7) indicates as appropriate proposed transportation enhancement activities. Authorizes the Secretary to provide for the development of abbreviated strategies for metropolitan areas not designated as a transportation management area. Requires States to develop a statewide transportation strategy that takes into account the transportation needs of areas that have no MPO. Directs the MPO to develop and submit to the Secretary for review a transportation improvement program for a three-year period and, to the extent practicable, for subsequent three-year periods. Requires States to develop and submit similar programs. Requires each MPO to submit to the Governor and the Secretary a list of highway and transit projects for its transportation management area. Prohibits approval of projects funded under the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1991 or this Act unless they are included in the list of projects approved by an MPO. Excepts from such approval requirement projects mandated by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Requires the Secretary to ensure that capital and block transportation grants be used to support balanced and comprehensive transportation planning that takes into account the relationships among land use and all transportation modes, without regard to the programmatic source of such planning funds. Sets forth a formula for the allocation of such amounts to metropolitan areas. Allocates a specified supplemental amount to States for MPO's in transportation management areas. Declares that the Federal share of costs for such transportation planning activities shall be 75 percent, except where the Secretary determines that it is in the Federal interest not to require a State or local match. Increases the amount allocated in each fiscal year for block grants for public transportation projects in urbanized areas with populations of less than 200,000, and urbanized ares with populations of more than 200,000. Authorizes grants for construction projects in designated transportation management areas to be made available also for highway construction projects if specified requirements are met. Revises the formula for apportioning public transportation block grants for urbanized areas according to fixed guideway revenue vehicle or route miles, bus revenue vehicle miles, and bus passenger miles. Declares that a recipient's apportionment for such grants shall not be reduced because of a reduction in equipment use if such recipient demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such actions would achieve energy or operating efficiencies and provide the same frequency of revenue service to the same number of riders. Makes specified safety provisions of the Act applicable to public transportation block grants. Requires certain required annual certifications by public transportation block grantees to be consolidated into a single document as part of such grantee's application. Requires the Secretary to establish streamlined administrative procedures to govern compliance with certification requirements with respect to block grantee control over track and signal equipment used in ongoing operations. Revises certain requirements of block grantees with respect to the preparation of a proposed program of projects to require them to assure that the program provides for the maximum feasible coordination of public transportation services assisted under the Act with transportation services assisted by other Federal sources. States that vessels funded under the Act as part of a statewide ferry system may be operated outside the urbanized area they serve to accommodate periodic maintenance, as long as the mass transportation service is not significantly reduced. Amends the Federal Mass Transportation Act of 1987 to repeal specified conditions currently placed on increased operating assistance for commuter rail service in southern Florida. Amends the Act to make each university transportation center responsible for research on transportation safety. Requires the Secretary to coordinate the research, education training and technology transfer in such centers, the dissemination of the results of the research, and a clearinghouse between the centers and the transportation industry. Abolishes the national advisory council currently authorized to provide such coordination. Makes up to one percent of the funds available to the Secretary from any source available specifically for administrative expenses incurred in connection with administration of the university transportation centers program. Authorizes the Secretary to make transportation research appropriations available to one or more of such centers for research compatible with the research conducted pursuant to authorizations under the Act or from the Highway Trust Fund. Directs the Secretary to make grants to colleges or universities to establish three additional National Centers for Transportation Management, Research, and Development as a means to accelerate the involvement of minorities and women in transportation-related professions, particularly in the science, technology, and engineering disciplines. Prohibits the Secretary from using any other methods to propose or implement rulemaking under the Act except as provided by it. Authorizes the Secretary to transfer facilities and equipment acquired but no longer needed by a recipient of Federal transportation funds to any public body for any public purpose so long as such facilities remain in public use for at least five years after such transfer. Sets forth specified determinations the Secretary must make before authorizing such a transfer of assets for purposes other than mass transportation. Authorizes the Secretary to allow the solicitation for a turnkey system project ( a vender-specific project under which a recipient contracts with a vendor to build a transit system that meets specific performance criteria and which is operated by such vendor for a period of time) to be awarded before Federal requirements are met so long as such award is made without prejudice to such requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to approve no more than four projects for an initial demonstration phase. Authorizes a recipient procuring rolling stock with Federal transportation assistance to enter into a multiyear agreement for the purchase of such stock and replacement parts in which the recipient may exercise an option to purchase more stock or replacement parts for up to a five-year period from the date of the original contract. Directs the Secretary to permit two or more recipients to form a consortium to purchase such stock. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants and loans to the Governor of each State for allocation to State approved nonprofit organizations and public bodies (currently, such assistance goes directly to private nonprofit corporations and associations) to assist such organizations and public bodies to provide transportation services to elderly persons and persons with disabilities. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations to allow vehicles purchased with such assistance to be leased to local public bodies and agencies as a means of improving transportation service to such individuals. Requires the Secretary to authorize mass transportation service providers receiving Federal transportation assistance to assist in providing meal delivery service for homebound persons on a regular basis if such service does not conflict with the provision, or result in a reduction, of mass transportation services. Authorizes States to transfer facilities and equipment acquired with Federal transportation assistance for nonurbanized areas or elderly persons and persons with disabilities to any recipient eligible to receive such assistance if such equipment or facilities continue to be used in accordance with the requirements for such assistance. Authorizes Maine, South Dakota, and Oklahoma to use grants apportioned to them as Federal transportation assistance for nonurbanized areas to offset no more than 50 percent of each one's share of operating losses incurred by Amtrak in providing rail service to it. Authorizes the Secretary to retain and to continue to use any returned grant or contract funds for programs that address human resource needs with respect to public transportation activities. Authorizes appropriations from the Mass Transit Account and Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund and from the general fund of the Treasury for FY 1992 through 1996 for formula and capital grant programs for mass transportation projects. Earmarks set-asides of such funds and funds appropriated under the National Capital Transportation Act of 1969 for: (1) metropolitan planning activities; (2) rural transit assistance programs; (3) State and national transportation planning and research programs; (4) administrative expenses of the Secretary; (5) transportation services to elderly persons and persons with disabilities; and (6) university transportation centers. Makes specified amounts of such funds available for: (1) completion of interstate transfer transit projects; and (2) block grants for transportation projects in urbanized areas. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on safety conditions in mass transportation. Prohibits the Secretary from using more than three-quarters of one percent (currently, one-half of one percent) of funds for mass transportation projects to contract with persons overseeing the construction of such projects. Makes funds available for: (1) State transit cooperative research programs; and (2) State transportation planning and research in urbanized areas. Requires the Secretary, as part of the cooperative transit research program, to establish an independent governing board to recommend mass transportation research, development, and technology transfer activities. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to, and enter into cooperative agreements with, the National Academy of Sciences to implement such activities. Makes funds available to the Secretary for grants or contracts for national mass transportation programs.

Authorizes the Secretary to undertake a program of transit technology development. Requires the Secretary to establish an Industry Technical Panel to assist in identifying priority technology development areas and in establishing guidelines for project development, project cost sharing, and project execution. Authorizes funds for mass transportation projects appropriated before October 1, 1983, that remain available for expenditure after October 1, 1991, to be transferred to the most recent appropriation for such projects. Requires the Comptroller General to submit to the Congress specified reports evaluating: (1) the impact of existing charter service regulations; and (2) the extent to which the Nation's transit needs are being adequately addressed. Revises the formulae for determining a State's apportionment of grants for urban mass transit programs, block grants for mass transportation projects in urbanized areas with populations of less than 200,000, and formula grants for mass transportation projects in nonurbanized areas. Requires, in such formulae, the use of population estimates prepared by the Secretary of Commerce after the expiration of four and eight years after the most recent Federal census becomes available. Requires the Secretary, for FY 1992, to use 1990 Federal census data to determine State allocations for mass transportation assistance: (1) to urbanized and nonurbanized area; and (2) in providing transportation services to elderly persons and persons with disabilities. Title IV: Private Property Rights - Private Property Rights Act - Declares that no regulation promulgated after enactment of this Act shall become effective until the Attorney General certifies the issuing agency to be in compliance with Executive Order 12630 or similar procedures for the taking of private property in the course of Federal regulatory activity, with the goal of minimizing such where possible. (Gives the force and effect of statute to certain procedures under Executive Order 12630 providing for the taking of such property for which compensation is required.) Requires the Attorney General expeditiously to approve compliance guidelines an agency proposes or notify it of any revisions necessary. Provides for a limited judicial review of actions taken pursuant to this Act applicable to whether the Attorney General has certified the issuing agency as in compliance with the Executive Order or similar procedures."
