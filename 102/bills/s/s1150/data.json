    "as": "Conference report filed in House", 
    "date": "1992-06-29", 
    "text": "Higher Education Amendments of 1992 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to revise and reauthorize its various programs. Title I: Partnerships for Educational Excellence - Revises HEA title I and renames it Partnerships for Educational Excellence (replaces the current title I, Postsecondary Programs for Nontraditional Students). Establishes as part A of title I a School, College, and University Partnerships program to encourage partnerships between institutions of higher education or State higher education agencies (or a consortium of any of such entities) and secondary schools serving low-income and disadvantaged students to support programs to improve school retention and graduation rates, student academic skills, opportunities to continue education beyond high school, and prospects for productive employment. Requires an institution of higher education or a State higher education agency (or consortium), to be eligible for such a partnership grant, to enter a written partnership agreement with a local education agency (LEA). Allows such partnership to include businesses, labor organizations, professional associations, community-based organizations, public television or other communications entities, or other public or private agencies or organizations. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to such partnerships to support the authorized program activities. Requires that grant preference be given to: (1) programs to serve predominantly low-income neighborhoods; (2) partnerships to run programs during the regular school year and during the summer; (3) programs to serve educationally disadvantaged students, potential dropouts, pregnant adolescents, and teen-aged parents; and (4) programs designed to encourage women and minorities underrepresented in science and mathematics to pursue these fields. Requires maintenance of fiscal effort by LEAs participating in such partnership agreements. Requires such grant applications to assure: (1) establishment of a partnership governing body including one representative from each participant; (2) a gradually declining specified Federal share of project costs; and (3) use of such Federal grant funds to supplement and not supplant non-Federal funds. Allows a waiver of the matching requirement in hardship cases. Requires peer review of applications. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1997 for such partnership program. Establishes as part B of title I an Articulation Agreements program of grants for articulation agreements and planning between partnerships of two-year and four-year institutions of higher education. Directs the Secretary to make such grants to States to make awards to articulation partnerships between qualified institutions, on the basis of either a competition or a formula determined by the State. Provides for allocation of such grant funds to States: (1) by a formula based on the relative total amount of student assistance received under HEA title IV by students attending institutions in the State, if the authorization of appropriations for such grants program equals or exceeds a specified amount; or (2) if such authorized amount is less than the specified amount, by competitive grants which the Secretary is authorized to make to States. Sets forth requirements for State and local applications, articulation agreements, and State administrative costs limitation. Includes, among various authorized uses of funds to an articulation partnership, development of agreements with LEAs for vocational course equivalency approval procedures for purposes of satisfying entrance requirements to qualified institutions. Requires States to give priority to grant applications for programs which: (1) encourage teacher education; (2) have, as one partner participating in the agreement, an entity meeting a specified requirement for the tech-prep education program consortia (i.e. a local or intermediate educational agency or area vocational education school serving secondary school students, or a secondary school funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs) under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act; (3) contribute their own institutional resources; (4) are not subject to a student loan default reduction agreement under title IV (Student Assistance) of HEA; or (5) encourage articulation in subject areas of national importance as determined by the Secretary. Sets forth requirements for annual State program reports and for program evaluation by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to: (1) report to the Congress by January 31, 1996, on the results of such evaluation; and (2) disseminate findings relating to the most successful programs. Reserves limited amounts for such purposes. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1997 for such articulation agreements program. Adds a new part C, Access and Equity to Education for All Americans through Telecommunications. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to eligible partnerships to enable such partnerships to pay the Federal share (50 percent) of the cost of the education telecommunications activities and services which will benefit nontraditional postsecondary education students, including special services for individuals with disabilities (such as captioned films, television, and descriptive video and education media). Requires eligible partnerships to consist of a public broadcasting entity (or consortium) and an institution of higher education (or consortium). Allows such partnerships to also include a State, local government, or private nonprofit organization. Sets forth: (1) application requirements; (2) approval priorities; (3) authorized activities; (4) reporting requirements; and (5) dissemination requirements. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1997 for such telecommunications program. Title II: Academic Library and Information Technology Enhancement - Revises HEA title II and renames it Academic Libraries and Information Services (currently Academic Libraries and Information Technology Enhancement). Authorizes appropriations for FY 1993 through 1997 for the following title II programs: (1) part A, College Library Technology and Cooperation Grants; (2) part B, Library Education, Research, and Development; (3) part C, Improving Access to Research Library Resources; and (4) part D, Strengthening Library and Information Science Programs in Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Other Minority-Serving Institutions. Directs the Secretary to ensure that title II programs are administered by appropriate library experts. Transfers to title II the part A program of the College Library Technology and Cooperation Grants (currently part D) and eliminates current part A provisions for College Library Resources. Revises such College Library Technology and Cooperation Grants program to add provisions emphasizing the accessing and sharing of library and information resources through technology. Requires the Secretary to give priority, in awarding certain such grants, to institutions of higher education seeking assistance for projects which assist developing institutions of higher education in linking one or more institutions of higher education to resource sharing networks. Increases the required minimum grant amount and sets a maximum amount for certain grants. Revises and renames title II part B as Library Education, Research, and Development (currently Library Training, Research, and Development). Requires the Secretary to consult with appropriate library and information science professional organizations to determine: (1) critical needs under provisions for grants and contracts for library education and human resources development, and (2) priorities for awarding grants for research and demonstrations. Revises provisions for library education and human resource development to include assistance for training for library and information science, particularly in areas of critical needs such as recruitment and retention of minorities. Requires that stipends for certain fellowships and traineeships be for those who demonstrate need and are working toward a graduate degree. Revises provisions for research and demonstration projects to include those related to education in library and information science and to enhancement of library services through use of new technology. Revises title II part C and renames it as Improving Access to Research Library Resources (currently Strengthening Research Library Resources). Eliminates provisions which precluded part C grant recipients from receiving certain other title II grants. Adds a new title II part D program for Strengthening Library and Information Science Programs in Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Directs the Secretary to make grants to, and contracts with, historically black colleges and universities and library organizations or agencies which have nationally approved programs in library and information science to educate and train African Americans and other ethnic minorities, particularly in areas of critical needs. Requires that at least 75 percent of such funds be used to establish or maintain graduate fellowships or traineeships. Allows the remainder to be used for: (1) costs of courses of study or staff development, including short-term or regular session institutes; and (2) establishing, developing, or expanding programs of library and information science, including new techniques of information transfer and communication technology. Adds a new title II part E Funding Prohibition. Prohibits funding in FY 1993 through 1997 for new programs or expanded programs under this Act, unless and until Congress enacts appropriations for HEA title II programs enacted prior to this Act at a level no less than the FY 1992 funding level for such preexisting programs. Title III: Institutional Aid - Revises and reauthorizes HEA title III (Institutional Aid). Revises title III part A (Strengthening Institutions) provisions relating to award of grants, eligible institutions, and duration of grants. Requires part A grant applications to describe measurable goals for the institution's financial management and academic program and include a plan for achieving such goals.
