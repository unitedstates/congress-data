Requires the Office to be headed by a Director who advises the Secretary of Education on the characteristics and needs of rural schools, and the effects current policies and proposed statutory, regulatory, administrative, and budgetary changes have on states and local educational agencies (LEAs) that serve such schools. Requires the Director to: establish and maintain a clearinghouse for collecting and disseminating certain information on rural education; identify innovative research and demonstration projects on topics of importance to rural schools; coordinate rural education activities within the Department; inform the Department of other federal agency activities related to rural education; coordinate its activities with Indian schools and the Department of the Interior's responsibilities regarding such schools; provide technical assistance and other support for rural education improvement efforts; and produce an annual report, for Congress and the public, on the condition of rural education. Requires the Director to prepare regulatory impact analyses of the Secretary's proposed and final rules that may have a significant impact on states or LEAs that serve rural schools."
