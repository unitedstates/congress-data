Requires the Chief, before establishing any such restricted area after this Act's enactment, to: (1) ensure that any restrictions are based on operational conditions that create hazardous waters, and (2) publish and seek and consider public comment on a draft describing the restricted area. Prohibits the Chief from: (1) implementing or enforcing the restricted area until two years after this Act's enactment, or (2) taking any action to establish a permanent physical barrier in connection with such area. (Excludes the installation and maintenance of measures for alerting the public of hazardous water conditions as such a permanent physical barrier.) Makes enforcement of a restricted area the sole responsibility of the state in which such area is located. Prohibits the Chief from assessing any penalty for entering a restricted area of public park and recreational facilities at water resource development projects."
