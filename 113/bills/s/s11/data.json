Establishes a minimum monthly Social Security insurance benefit. Increases monthly Social Security insurance benefit after 20 years of initial eligibility.

Entitles disabled beneficiaries who attain early retirement age to only the larger or, if the individual so elects, only the smaller of disability or old age benefits. Directs the Commissioner of Social Security to establish: (1) an option for a fully insured individual to elect to receive a reduced monthly benefit after such individual attains age 62, and (2) a public information campaign to provide information and education regarding the implications on personal financial security of early and other retirement decisions and the need for greater retirement savings.
