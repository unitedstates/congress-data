Authorizes the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to: (1) conduct epidemiological studies (as currently required) on the clinical, biological, social, environmental, genetic, and behavioral factors related to prematurity, as appropriate; (2) conduct activities to improve national data to facilitate tracking preterm births; and (3) continue efforts to prevent preterm birth through the identification of opportunities for prevention and the assessment of their impact. (Sec. 3) Requires the Director of the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth to give preference in awarding grants to an eligible entity that proposes to use the grant funds to develop plans for, or to establish, telehealth networks that provide prenatal care for high-risk pregnancies. Revises and reauthorizes through FY2017 the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct demonstration projects related to preterm births. Includes as activities under such projects programs to test and evaluate various strategies to provide information and education to health care providers and the public on: (1) the core risk factors for preterm labor and delivery, medically indicated deliveries before full term, (2) the importance of preconception and prenatal care, (3) treatments and outcomes for premature infants, (4) meeting the informational needs of families during the stay of an infant in a neonatal intensive care unit, and (5) utilization of evidence-based strategies to prevent birth injuries. Authorizes as additional activities under such projects the establishment of programs to increase the availability, awareness, and use of pregnancy and post-term information services that provide evidence-based, clinical information through counselors, community outreach efforts, electronic or telephonic communication, or other appropriate means regarding causes associated with prematurity, birth defects, or health risks to a post-term infant. (Sec. 4) Repeals establishment of the Interagency Coordinating Council on Prematurity and Low Birthweight. Authorizes the Secretary to establish the Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality. Directs the Advisory Committee (or an existing advisory committee designated by the Secretary) to develop, and periodically review and revise, a plan for conducting and supporting research, education, and programs on preterm birth through HHS. Requires the Secretary to designate an appropriate agency within HHS to coordinate existing studies and report to the Secretary and Congress on hospital readmissions of preterm infants."
