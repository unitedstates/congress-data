Applies the financial disclosure reporting requirements and restrictions of the STOCK Act only to Members of Congress, congressional candidates, the President, the Vice President, and executive branch officers at levels I and II of the Executive Schedule who require nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate. Extends the deadline until January 1, 2014, for: the Secretary, the Sergeant at Arms, and the Clerk to develop systems to enable the electronic filing of financial disclosure reports as well as their on-line public availability; the Director of the Office of Government Ethics to develop such systems for financial disclosure forms filed by covered executive branch officials. Repeals: (1) the prohibition against requiring a login to search or sort the data contained in the publicly available financial disclosure systems, and (2) the requirement that a login protocol with the name of the user be utilized by a person downloading data contained in the reports."
