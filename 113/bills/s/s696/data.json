    "date": "2013-04-10", 
    "text": "Safe Chemicals Act of 2013 - Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to state that it is the policy of the United States to: (1) protect the health of children, workers, consumers, and the public and to protect the environment from harmful exposures to chemical substances; (2) promote the use of safer alternatives and other actions that reduce the use of and exposure to hazardous chemical substances and reward innovation toward safer chemicals, processes, and products; (3) require that chemicals in commerce meet a risk-based safety standard that protects vulnerable and affected populations and the environment; (4) require companies to provide sufficient health and environmental information for the chemical substances that the companies manufacture, process, or import as a condition of allowing those companies to distribute chemical substances in commerce; (5) improve the quality of information on chemical safety and use; (6) guarantee the right of the public and workers to know about the hazards and uses of chemical substances that they may be exposed to by maximizing public access to information on chemical safety and use; and (7) strengthen cooperation among the federal, state, municipal, tribal, and foreign governments. Declares that it is the goal of the United States to address the harmful exposure of vulnerable or affected populations caused by the distribution of chemical substances in commerce by: (1) reviewing all chemical substances for safety and identifying the highest priority substances for expedited review, (2) determining whether chemical substances in commerce meet the safety standard under TSCA, (3) applying appropriate restrictions to the use of a chemical substance, and (4) encouraging the replacement of harmful chemicals and processes with safer alternatives. Adds and revises definitions under TSCA. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine that a variant of a chemical substance is a new chemical substance. Redefines \"distribute in commerce\" to include exporting a chemical substance, mixture, or article. Defines \u201ctoxic\u201d as a chemical substance or mixture that has a toxicological property: (1) meeting the criteria for Category 1or Category 2 for any of the toxicity endpoints established by the Globally Harmonized System for the Classification and Labeling of Hazardous Substances, (2) that causes an adverse effect that has been demonstrated in humans or other exposed organisms, or (3) for which the weight of evidence demonstrates the potential for an adverse effect in humans or other exposed organisms. Defines \"toxicological property\" to mean actual or potential toxicity or other adverse effects of a chemical substance or mixture, including effects of exposure on: (1) mortality; (2) morbidity, including carcinogenesis; (3) reproduction; (4) growth and development; (5) the immune system; (6) the endocrine system; (7) the brain or nervous system; (8) other organ systems; or (9) any other biological functions in humans or nonhuman organisms. Directs the Administrator to promulgate a rule that: (1) establishes minimum information sets to evaluate chemical substances; (2) provides for varied or tiered information to be provided for different chemical substances; (3) identifies the particular set that applies to a chemical substance; (4) requires each set to include sufficient information to conduct a screening-level risk assessment of the chemical substance; (5) specifies information quality and reliability requirements applicable to the information submitted; (6) accommodates the use of alternative testing methods and strategies to generate information quickly, at low cost, and with reduced use of animal-based testing to the extent such methods and strategies would yield information of equivalent quality and reliability; and (7) establishes sets sufficient to carry out categorization of new and existing chemical substances, assignment of chemical substances to priority classes, and safety standard determinations. Requires chemical manufacturers and processors to submit and update their minimum information sets. Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) require by rule or order the testing of, and the submission of test results for, any chemical substance; (2) require submission of a sample of any chemical substance for testing by a specified date; and (3) impose restrictions on violators of testing requirements, including a prohibition against manufacturing, processing, or distributing chemical substances. Requires such rule or order to: (1) include standards for the development of test information for a substance, and (2) specify testing deadlines. Authorizes the Administrator to prescribe standards for the development of test information for health and environmental information. Requires the Administrator to review such standards at least once every three years and make revisions if necessary. Requires any rule or order that requires the testing and submission of information for a particular chemical substance or for a category of chemical substances to expire by the end of the applicable reimbursement period. Sets forth exemptions to such testing requirements. Requires the Administrator, within 15 days after the receipt of test information pursuant to such rule or order, to publish a notice that: (1) identifies the chemical substance for which information has been received, (2) lists the uses of such substance and the information required by the applicable standards for the development of test information, and (3) describes the nature of such information developed. Requires each person who submits information under TSCA, rule, or order to certify that such information is accurate and reliable and includes all material facts. Prohibits a person from commercially manufacturing a new substance or processing a substance for a new use unless the person submits to the Administrator a notice of the intention to manufacture or process such substance and complies with data submission requirements, and the Administrator finds that: (1) the chemical substance is likely to meet the applicable safety standard under TSCA; or (2) the person has established that such use is in the paramount interest of national security, that the lack of availability of such substance would cause significant disruption in the national economy, and that such use is a critical or essential use for which no feasible safer alternative is available or that such use, as compared to alternatives, provides a substantial net benefit to human health, the environment, or public safety. Requires the Administrator to promulgate a rule that: (1) designates the categories for substances of very high concern, substances likely to meet the safety standard, substances with insufficient information, and substances unlikely to meet the safety standard; (2) specifies the process and criteria the Administrator will use to categorize new chemical substances; and (3) describes criteria and factors the Administrator will use to assess the weight of evidence and the quality and reliability of information used to inform categorization decisions. Requires the Administrator to assign a new chemical substance to one of such categories within 90 days after receiving such notice. Requires the Administrator to designate as a \"substance of very high concern\" any new substance that: (1) is toxic, persists in the environment, and is bioaccumulative; or (2) is highly hazardous. Prohibits manufacturing or processing such substance unless notice has been submitted pursuant to TSCA and the criteria for a substance of very high concern has been met. Requires the Administrator to designate as a \"substance likely to meet the safety standard\" any new chemical substance that the Administrator determines would likely meet the safety standard under TSCA: (1) for uses and under conditions specified by the submitter of such notice for such substance, and (2) for uses and under additional conditions that could be specified by the Administrator in making a safety standard determination for such substance. Requires the Administrator to assign to such category any new chemical substance that meets the criteria specified for \"substances of very low concern\" and \"substances to undergo safety standard determinations.\" Authorizes a chemical substance designated as a \"substance likely to meet the safety standard\" to be manufactured or processed under specified conditions, pending the completion of a safety standard determination. Requires the Administrator to designate as a \"substance with insufficient information\" any new chemical substance for which the Administrator concludes that needed information for such substance is not available, is insufficient, or is not of sufficient quality and reliability to allow for an informed categorization decision. Prohibits any person from manufacturing or processing a chemical substance designated under this category until the Administrator has recategorized the substance. Requires the Administrator to designate as a \"substance unlikely to meet the safety standard\" any new chemical substance that the Administrator determines would be unlikely to meet such standard: (1) for uses and under conditions specified by the submitter of a notice of the intention to manufacture or process the substance, or (2) for other uses or under additional conditions that the Administrator may evaluate in making a safety standard determination for the substance. Prohibits the manufacture and process of such substances. Prohibits, subject to an exemption, any person from manufacturing or processing an existing chemical substance for which the Administrator has not made a safety standard determination for a use that was not ongoing prior to this Act's enactment or at a volume that is significantly increased from the volume as of this Act's enactment. Prohibits manufacturing, processing, distributing in commerce, using, or disposing of an existing chemical that has met the applicable safety standard for uses at production volumes or in manners other than those specified in the safety determination, unless: (1) notice is made of the intention to manufacture and process such chemical; and (2) the Administrator determines that the person submitting such notice will continue to meet such standard. Sets forth provisions concerning amending safety standards and safety standard determinations. Requires the Administrator to determine that a variant of a chemical substance exhibiting special substance characteristics: (1) is a use that is separate from any use of the substance that does not exhibit such characteristics, or (2) is a distinct substance. Requires manufacturers or processors of: (1) a variant that the Administrator determines has a separate use, to satisfy conditions established by the Administrator; and (2) a distinct chemical substance that is not listed in the active inventory of chemical substances manufactured or processed published by the Administrator, to comply with requirements for new chemicals. Authorizes the Administrator to exempt from requirements for new chemicals and new uses of chemicals an intrinsically safe chemical substance that does not and would not pose any risk of injury to human health or the environment under any intended or reasonably anticipated levels of production, patterns of use, or exposures arising at any stage across the lifecycle of such substance. Authorizes the Administrator to order a manufacturer or processor to revise quality control procedures that are inadequate to prevent a chemical substance from presenting a risk of injury to human health or the environment. Sets forth provisions concerning notice requirements for polymeric chemical substances. Authorizes the Administrator to permit a person to manufacture or process of a chemical substance for test marketing purposes: (1) upon a showing that the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of such substance will not endanger human health or the environment; and (2) under such restrictions as the Administrator considers appropriate. Requires the Administrator to provide fair and equitable reimbursement for the costs incurred to comply with information submission requirements for a chemical substance when information has already been submitted for an equivalent substance. Sets forth exemptions from notice and data submission requirements for chemical substances that are manufactured and processed in small quantities solely for the purpose of: (1) scientific experimentation or analysis; or (2) chemical research on, or analysis of, substances. Authorizes the Administrator to exempt from notice and data submission requirements the manufacturing or processing of any chemical substance: (1) that exists temporarily as a result of a chemical reaction in the manufacturing or processing of a mixture or another substance; and (2) to which there is, and will be, no human or environmental exposure. Requires that each submission of information required under TSCA be accompanied by a certification of the accuracy, reliability, and inclusion of all material facts of such submission. Repeals provisions prohibiting federal agencies from selling, distributing, or transferring elemental mercury. Requires the Administrator to: (1) establish a system for assigning chemical substances into batches to ensure that an efficient and orderly process and pace are established for the determination of safety of chemical substances in commerce and the application of risk management measures as needed, (2) assign chemical substances on the active portion of the inventory to batches of chemical substances at least once every five years until all such substances have been so assigned, and (3) publish the list of substances assigned to each batch. Requires the initial batch to include substances for which reports are submitted to the Administrator under the chemical data reporting rule as of this Act\u2019s enactment. Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) include in such batch substances that are manufactured at volumes below the threshold for substances subject to basic reporting under such rule but that are used or released into the environment in a manner that warrants early evaluation by the Administrator; and (2) exclude from such batch substances that are reported under such rule but that are used or released into the environment in a manner that does not warrant early evaluation. Requires the Administrator to assign chemical substances to subsequent batches in a manner that reflects the extent to which the substances warrant earlier or later evaluation. Requires the Administrator to promulgate regulations that: (1) establish the categories and specify the process and criteria the Administrator will use to categorize chemical substances; (2) designate the process and criteria the Administrator will use to prioritize substances that are placed in the category of chemical substances to undergo safety standard determinations; (3) describe how the categorization and prioritization process and criteria relate to and take into account the categorization and prioritization decisions made in other jurisdictions, including states and foreign governments; (4) describe criteria and factors the Administrator will use to weigh evidence and assess the quality and reliability of information used to inform categorization and prioritization decisions; (5) incorporate and establish criteria for substances of very high concern, substances of very low concern, substances to undergo safety standard determinations, and substances with insufficient information; and (6) establish specified priority classes and criteria. Prohibits a chemical substance from being simultaneously in more than one the following categories: substances of very high concern, substances likely to meet the safety standard, substances with insufficient information, and substances unlikely to meet the safety standard. Requires the Administrator to publish: (1) such category assignments for chemical substances in the initial and subsequent batches, and (2) the priority class assignments for the chemical substances in the initial batch of chemical substances that the Administrator has assigned to the category of \"substances to undergo safety standard determinations and for the substances in subsequent batches that the Administrator has assigned to the category of \"chemical substances to undergo safety standard determinations.\" Requires the Administrator to designate as \"Priority Class 1\" those chemical substances that the Administrator determines warrant safety standard determinations in the near term. Requires the Administrator to initially assign as \"Priority Class 1\" substances that possess relatively greater hazard potential and for which there is evidence of more significant or widespread exposure. Authorizes the Administrator to designate as \"Priority Class 1\" any substance initially assigned to a lower priority class as safety determinations for the substance are completed. Directs the Administrator to: (1) designate as \"Priority Class 2\" those chemical substances that the Administrator determines are of lower priority than Priority Class 1 substances with respect to the timing for conducting safety standard determinations, and (2) require submission of the applicable minimum information set within five years of this Act\u2019s enactment and within five years after the assignment of a substance to such priority. Requires the Administrator to designate as \"Priority Class 3\" those chemical substances that the Administrator determines may be set aside for further assessment until such time as: (1) safety stand determinations are completed on all Priority Class 1and 2 substances, and (2) new information arises that warrants reprioritization of such substance to a higher priority class. Prohibits the Administrator from requiring submission of the applicable minimum information set for a substance designated under such class until such time as the substance is reassigned to Priority Class 1 or 2. Sets forth provisions concerning reprioritizing chemical substances. Requires chemical substance manufacturers and processors to: (1) bear the burden of proving that chemical substances meet applicable safety standards, and (2) provide sufficient information for the Administrator to determine whether such standards have been met. Allows a chemical substance that undergoes a safety standard determination to be manufactured, processed, or distributed in commerce only if the Administrator determines that the chemical substance: (1) meets the safety standard, or (2) can meet the safety standard for uses through the imposition of additional conditions. Requires the Administrator to base a determination of whether such standard has been met solely on considerations of human health and the environment.
