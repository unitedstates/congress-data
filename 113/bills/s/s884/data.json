Requires each report to identify countries that engage in such espionage as well as countries that engage in the most egregious forms of such espionage. Directs the President to exclude from entry into the United States any article produced or exported by an entity identified within any such report, as long as the President determines that such exclusion is warranted for the enforcement of intellectual property rights or to protect the integrity of the Department of Defense (DOD) supply chain."
