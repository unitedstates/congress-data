Allows an exception to such limitation for scientists, engineers, or other specialists who are needed to ensure that an executive agency has continued access to needed skills and capabilities. Requires the Director of OMB to report to specified congressional committees on contractor compensation, including the number of contractor employees hired in the preceding fiscal year who are exempt from the limitation on compensation imposed by this Act."
