Extends from a 5-year to a 10-year period the phase-in period for premium adjustment increases in the flood insurance risk rate. Prescribes a phase-in rate of: (1) 5% for each of the first 5 years after the effective date of an update, and 15% for each of the 5 ensuing years; and (2) 5% for each of the first 5 years following the effective date of designation as a special flood area of any area not previously so designated, and 15% for each of the 5 ensuing years."
