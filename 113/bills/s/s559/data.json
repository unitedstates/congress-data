Imposes a surcharge, to be deposited into the Fund, of 30% on the amount of: (1) any fine or monetary penalty assessed on a person for violation of a law or regulation penalizing any economic activity relating to Iran that is administered by the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Justice (DOJ), or the Department of Commerce; or (2) the monetary amount of a settlement entered into by a person regarding a suspected violation of such a law or regulation. Requires Fund payments of $150,000 plus $5,000 for each day of captivity first to each living former hostage and then to the estate of each deceased former hostage. Requires a payment recipient to waive and forever release all existing claims against Iran and the United States arising out of the hostage events. Directs the Secretary to notify each individual qualified to receive a payment of the individual's claim status. States that: (1) if a claim is denied or approved for less than the full amount, the individual shall be entitled to submit additional information; (2) the Secretary may affirm, modify, or revise the former action; and (3) the Secretary's actions in identifying claimants and in disbursing Fund amounts shall be final on all questions of law and fact, and shall not be subject to review by any other U.S. official, agency, or court. Directs the Secretary to report annually to Congress on the status of the Fund until the date: (1) on which all amounts have been made to all recipients, or (2) five years after the date of enactment of this Act."
