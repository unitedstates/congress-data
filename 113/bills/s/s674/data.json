Provides for the continuous resubmission of, and required response to, requests not acted upon within the original or estimated period. Requires the Secretary to notify the appropriate claimant of each request made and explanation and estimate received. Directs the Secretary to: (1) keep records of the information requested and the time it takes to receive responses, and (2) submit semiannually to the congressional veterans committees a summary of such records."
