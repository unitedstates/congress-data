Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to modify a fuel system requirements harmonization study to: (1) include consideration of biofuels, (2) add consideration of the projected effects of EPA Tier III requirements on air quality and motor fuel prices, and (3) extend to June 1, 2014, the date for submission to Congress of a report on the results of the study."
