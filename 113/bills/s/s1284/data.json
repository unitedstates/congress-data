(Sec. 518) Prohibits the use of funds in this Act to enter into a contract in an amount greater than $5 million or to award a grant in excess of such amount unless the prospective contractor or grantee certifies in writing to the agency awarding the contract or grant that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, it has: (1) filed all federal tax returns required during the three years preceding the certification; (2) not been convicted of a criminal offense under the Internal Revenue Code; and (3) not, within 90 days before certification, been notified of any unpaid federal tax assessment for which the liability remains unsatisfied, unless the assessment is the subject of an installment agreement or offer in compromise that has been approved by the IRS and is not in default, or the assessment is the subject of a non-frivolous administrative or judicial proceeding. (Sec. 519) Rescinds permanently specified funds made available for performance bonus payments under title XXI (State Children's Health Insurance Program) (CHIP) of the Social Security Act. (Sec. 520) Bars use of funds to distribute any needle or syringe to prevent the spread of blood borne pathogens in any location that has been determined by the local public health or local law enforcement authorities to be inappropriate for such distribution. (Sec. 521) Transfers permanently from the HHS Secretary to the Secretary of Education the Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) program under the Public Health Service Act, and the authority to administer the program, including servicing, collecting, and enforcing any HEAL loans that remain outstanding. (Sec. 522) Authorizes federal agencies to use federal discretionary funds made available in this Act to carry out up to 13 Performance Partnership Pilots. Defines a \"Performance Partnership Pilot\" as a project that seeks to identify, through a demonstration, cost-effective strategies for providing services at the state, regional, or local level that: (1) involve two or more federal programs (administered by one or more federal agencies) with related policy goals, at least one of which is administered (in whole or in part) by a state, local, or tribal government; and (2) achieve better results for regions, communities, or specific at-risk populations through making better use of the budgetary resources that are available for supporting such programs. Requires that such Pilots: (1) be designed to increase the rate at which disconnected youth ages 14-24 (who are low-income and either homeless, in foster care, involved in the juvenile justice system, unemployed, or not enrolled in or at risk of dropping out of an educational institution) achieve success in meeting educational, employment, or other key goals; and (2) involve federal programs targeted on such youth, or designed to prevent youth from disconnecting from school or work, that provide education, training, employment, and other related social services. Prescribes requirements for Performance Partnership Agreements between a lead federal administering agency (designated by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget [OMB]) and a state, local, or tribal government. (Sec. 523) Requires the head of any executive branch department, agency, board, commission, or office (entity) funded by this Act to report annually to its Inspector General (or senior ethics official if there is no Inspector General) regarding the costs and contracting procedures related to each conference held by the entity during FY2014 for which the cost to the U.S. government exceeded $100,000. Requires each entity head, within 15 days of any conference costing the U.S. government during FY2014 more than $20,000, to notify its Inspector General or senior ethics official of the date, location, and number of employees attending the conference. Declares that a grant or contract funded by amounts appropriated by this Act to an executive branch agency may not be used to defray the costs of any such conference that is not directly and programmatically related to the purpose for which the grant or contract was awarded. Prohibits the use of funds made available by this Act for travel and conference activities that are not in compliance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-12-12 dated May 11, 2012. (Sec. 524) Requires each federal agency or bureau (or operating division) in an agency with multiple bureaus, which is funded under this Act and has research and development expenditures exceeding $100 million per year, to develop a federal research public access policy. Requires such a policy to provide for: (1) submission to the agency, agency bureau, or designated entity acting on the agency's behalf, a machine-readable version of the author's final peer-reviewed manuscripts that have been accepted for publication in peer-reviewed journals describing research supported, in whole or in part, from funding by the federal government; (2) free online public access to such final peer-reviewed manuscripts or published versions within 12 months after the official publication date; and (3) compliance with all relevant copyright laws."
