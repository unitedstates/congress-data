    "text": "Reinvesting In Vital Economic Rivers and Waterways Act of 2013 or RIVER Act - Directs the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to promulgate regulations that, at a minimum, require certain delivery process criteria for qualifying construction and major rehabilitation projects for navigation infrastructure of inland and intracoastal waterways. Directs the Secretary, in conjunction with the Inland Waterways Users Board, to submit to Congress a 20-year program for making capital investments on inland and intracoastal waterways. Allows such program to be based on the 20-year capital investment strategy contained in the Inland Marine Transportation System Capital Projects Business Model, Final Report published on April 13, 2010, as approved by the Board. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to limit expenditures from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund to 50% of the total cost of the construction or rehabilitation project. Makes Fund amounts unavailable for: (1) construction or rehabilitation of dams, or (2) rehabilitation expenditures that do not equal or exceed $50 million. Increases the Inland Waterways Trust Fund financing rate (user fee) from 20 cents to 29 cents after 2013."
