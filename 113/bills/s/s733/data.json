Defines \"exascale computing\" as computing through the use of a computing machine that performs near or above 10 to the 18th power floating point operations per second. Directs the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to: (1) conduct a research program to develop exascale computing machines to promote DOE missions; (2) establish national laboratory-industry partnerships for the research and development of exascale computing machines across all applicable DOE agencies; (3) implement the program through an integration of application, computer science, and computer hardware architecture using public-private partnerships to ensure that exascale computing machines are capable of solving DOE target applications and scientific problems; and (4) use existing funds to carry out the program. Authorizes appropriations for FY2014-FY2016."
