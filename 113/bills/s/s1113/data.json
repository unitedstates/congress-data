Requires each partnership to consist of: (1) a public or private entity experienced in training elementary school principals, (2) at least one public agency, and (3) at least one early childhood education organization that trains early childhood education providers. Requires grantees to conduct an ongoing evaluation of the effectiveness of their grant-funded programs and activities. Directs the Secretary to establish a panel of leading experts in elementary and early childhood education to: (1) identify the best practices in professional development for elementary school principals in early childhood education, (2) review the effective coordination of such training among this Act's grantees, and (3) disseminate the latest research and findings regarding such training."
