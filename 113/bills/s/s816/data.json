States that the land management goals of a project may include: (1) road and trail maintenance or obliteration to restore or maintain water quality; (2) soil productivity, habitat for wildlife and fisheries, or other resource values; (3) setting of prescribed fires to improve the composition, structure, condition, and health of stands or to improve wildlife habitat; (4) removing vegetation or other activities to promote healthy forest stands, reduce fire hazards, or achieve other land management objectives; (5) watershed restoration and maintenance; (6) restoration and maintenance of wildlife and fish; or (7) control of noxious and exotic weeds and reestablishing native plant species. Defines \"eligible land\" to mean land located on National Forest System land or Bureau of Land Management [BLM]) land located west of the 100th meridian. Repeals a section of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 that provides for forest health protection."
