(Sec. 107) Permits renewal of the terms of such appointments to an additional two years, based on a critical organizational need. (Currently such term is limited to four years only.) (Sec. 108) Requires: (1) the IRS to issue a notice of confirmation of any address change relating to an employer making employment tax payments, (2) such notice to be sent to both the employer's former and new address, and (3) an IRS officer or employee to give special consideration to an offer-in-compromise from a taxpayer who has been the victim of fraud by a third party payroll tax preparer. (Sec. 109) Requires the IRS to: develop, institute, and publicize on its website clear guidance for processing requests for tax-exempt status involving potentially significant political campaign intervention to provide transparency to organizations on the application process; institute internal controls and management oversight to ensure that the applications are approved or denied expeditiously, using objective criteria; and conduct staff training before each federal election cycle including, at a minimum, instruction on what activities by tax-exempt organizations constitute political campaign intervention rather than general advocacy. (Sec. 112) Bars the use of IRS funds to target U.S. citizens for exercising any right guaranteed under the First Amendment to the Constitution. (Sec. 117) Bars the use of funds to the Department of the Treasury or the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to redesign the $1 Federal Reserve note. (Sec. 119) Extends from 14 to 17 years the authorization for the personnel management demonstration project for employees who fill critical scientific, technical, engineering, intelligence analyst, language translator, and medical positions in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF).

(Sec. 122) Deems any funds appropriated by this Act, or made available by the transfer of funds in this Act, for intelligence activities to be specifically authorized by Congress for purposes of the National Security Act of 1947 during FY2014, until enactment of the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2014. (Sec. 123) Requires up to $5,000 to be made available from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's Industrial Revolving Fund for necessary official reception and representation expenses. (Sec. 124) Requires the Secretary to submit a Capital Investment Plan to congressional appropriations committees within 30 days after the submission of the President's annual budget. (Sec. 125) Requires amounts appropriated to the Secretary for mandatory refunding of internal revenue collections to be administered as if they were made available through separate appropriations to the Secretary, the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Attorney General. Makes such appropriated funds available to: the Secretary for refunds by the IRS of taxes collected and related interest and separately, for refunds and drawbacks of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and ammunition taxes and refunds of other taxes which may arise; DHS for refunds and drawbacks of receipts collected pursuant to the customs revenue function; and the Attorney General for refunds of firearms taxes and of other taxes which may arise. Makes such funds available also for payment of interest and prior fiscal year claims. (Sec. 126) Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) locate and recover federal assets on behalf of any executive, judicial, or legislative agency in accordance with appropriate procedures; and (2) retain a portion of such recovered amounts to cover related administrative and operational costs.

States that these requirements satisfy federal credit reform requirements of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 that: allow new direct loan obligations to be incurred and new loan guarantee commitments to be made only to the extent of advance budget authority in an appropriations Act, and prohibit modification of an outstanding direct loan (or direct loan obligation) or loan guarantee (or loan guarantee commitment) in a manner that increases its costs unless budget authority for the additional cost has been provided in advance in an appropriations Act.

(Sec. 203) Limits the availability of appropriations to such Office in this Act to: (1) a 2% transfer between appropriated programs upon the advance approval of congressional appropriations committees; and (2) up to $1 million for reprogramming within a program, project, or activity upon such approval.

Sets forth certain transfers of funds. (Sec. 305) Requires the U.S. Marshals Service to provide, as a pilot program, specified security services (except investigations) for courthouses which federal law authorizes DHS to provide.

(In effect lengthens by one year the respective temporary judgeships in the districts of Kansas and Hawaii.) Amends the Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, the Judiciary, the District of Columbia, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, of 2006 to prohibit the filling of the first vacancy in the office of district judge in the eastern district of Missouri occurring 21 (currently, 20) years and six months or more after the confirmation date of the judge named to fill the temporary judgeship. (In effect lengthens by one year the period of the respective temporary judgeship in such district.) Amends the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act to prohibit the filling of the first vacancy in the office of district judge in: (1) the northern district of Alabama, the district of Arizona, the southern district of Florida, the district of New Mexico, and the eastern district of Texas occurring 12 years (currently, 11 years) or more after the confirmation date of the judge named to fill the respective temporary judgeships, and (2) the central district of California occurring 11 years (currently, 10 years) and 6 months or more after the confirmation date of the judge named to fill the temporary judgeship. (In effect lengthens by one year the period of the temporary judgeship in that district.)

Converts existing temporary district judgeships to permanent for the district of Arizona, the central district of California, and the district of New Mexico. Increases district court filing fees from $350 to $362. Continues the mandatory $5 fee on an application for a writ of habeas corpus. Requires incremental amounts collected because of enactment of this Act to be deposited as offsetting receipts in the \"Judiciary Filing Fee\" special fund in the Treasury. Makes such amounts available solely for facilitating the processing of civil cases, but only to the extent specifically appropriated by an Act of Congress after enactment of this Act. (Sec. 309) Amends the federal judicial code to prohibit the exclusion of citizens from service as a grand or petit juror in U.S. district courts or the Court of International Trade on account of sexual orientation or gender identity (thereby expanding the current prohibition against exclusion on account of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or economic status).

(Sec. 503) Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act to authorize the CPSC to permit a foreign government agency to share, subject to specified requirements and limitations, information obtained from the CPSC with its other foreign agencies and political subdivisions located within its same territory or administrative area, as well as disclose the information to legislative and judicial bodies with jurisdiction over the foreign government agency. States that nothing in such Act may be construed to prohibit the CPSC from providing any information received, which is related to an immediate health or safety threat to the public or to a potential violation of a criminal law, to the Attorney General or to other appropriate federal, state, or local agencies.

(Sec. 531) Amends the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 to rescind the September 27, 2012, repeal of the SBA Administrator's authority under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to provide refinancing, under the local development business loan program, for previous business debts meeting specified criteria involved in certain projects that do not involve small business expansions.

(Sec. 618) Requires any executive agency covered by this Act, except GSA and the U.S. Postal Service, which is otherwise authorized to enter into contracts for either leases or the construction or alteration of real property for office, meeting, storage, or other space, to consult with GSA before issuing a solicitation for offers of new leases or construction contracts (and in the case of succeeding leases, before entering into negotiations with the current lessor).

(Sec. 623) Repeals the requirement that the President's budget submission include a detailed, separate analysis, by budget function, by agency, and by initiative area for the prior, the current, the pending, and the ensuing fiscal years identifying the appropriations or obligational authority and outlays that contribute to homeland security.
