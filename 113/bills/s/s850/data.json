Prohibits the Board from appointing any personnel or implementing, administering, or enforcing any decision, rule, vote, or other action decided, undertaken, adopted, issued, or finalized on or after January 4, 2012, that requires a quorum of the Board members. Terminates the requirements of this Act upon: (1) confirmation of all Board members constituting a quorum with the advice and consent of the Senate, (2) a decision by the Supreme Court on the constitutionality of Board appointments made in January 2012, or (3) the adjournment sine die of the first session of the 113th Congress. Prohibits, in the event of this Act's termination, the implementation, administration, or enforcement of any Board action or appointment occurring on or after January 4, 2012, that requires authorization by not less than a quorum of the Board members, unless and until the action is considered and acted upon by a Board constituting a quorum, or the Supreme Court issues a decision on the constitutionality of the Board appointments made in January 2012."
