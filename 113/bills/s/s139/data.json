    "text": "Pregnant Women Health and Safety Act - Subjects to fines and/or imprisonment any physician who knowingly performs an abortion but fails to comply with this Act. Requires a physician who performs an abortion to: (1) have admitting privileges at a local hospital, and (2) notify the patient of the location of the hospital where the patient can receive follow-up care by the physician if complications arise. Exempts from these requirements a physician who performs an abortion that is necessary to save the life of a mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself. Prohibits a woman upon whom an abortion is performed from being prosecuted for conspiracy to violate this Act. Requires each abortion clinic that receives federal funds or assistance to be licensed by the state and be in compliance with the requirements for ambulatory surgery centers under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act, except for the requirement of a certificate of public need. Allows a state board of health to waive the application of certain structural requirements for licensing purposes in order to comply with this Act."
