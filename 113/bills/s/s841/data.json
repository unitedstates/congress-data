Requires the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to develop a management plan for the long-term protection and management of the Special Management Area. Designates specified land within the Protection Area as the Hermosa Creek Wilderness. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, upon the expiration of a specified permit, to convey to La Plata County, Colorado, identified land managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Tres Rios District in Colorado. Requires such land to be used only for public purposes consistent with the uses allowed under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act. Requires the County to: (1) pay all survey costs and other administrative costs necessary for preparing and completing patents for, and transfers of title to, such land; and (2) agree in writing to pay administrative costs associated with such conveyance, including the costs of environmental, wildlife, cultural, or historical resources studies. Releases the West Needles Contiguous Wilderness Study Area in San Juan County, Colorado, from further study for designation as wilderness."
