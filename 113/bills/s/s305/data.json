    "text": "Champion Hill, Port Gibson, and Raymond Battlefields Addition Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire land or interests within the area identified as the modified core battlefield for the Port Gibson, Champion Hill, and Raymond battlefields of the Vicksburg campaign of the American Civil War for inclusion in the Vicksburg National Military Park in Mississippi. Allows such lands to be acquired by donation, purchase, or exchange, except that land owned by the state of Mississippi or any political subdivisions of Mississippi may be acquired only by donation. Requires the acquired land to be added to and administered as part of the Park. Authorizes appropriations of $18.5 million for the acquisition and development of land under this Act. Amends the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009, in order to offset such amount, to reduce by $18.5 million any amounts of the annual authorization of appropriations for the Preserve America Program that are not yet appropriated as of the date of enactment of this Act."
