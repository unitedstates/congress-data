    "text": "Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2013 - Reauthorizes the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 through FY2019. Revises the Act to allow a joint interagency office, designated by the governor, to serve as the lead agency for a state desiring to receive a community services programs child care and development block grant. Increases from two to three years the period that must be covered by a state child care and development plan. Revises and expands plan requirements to include, among others, compliance with state and local health and safety requirements, compliance with child abuse reporting requirements, protection for working parents, and coordination with other programs. Prescribes early learning and developmental guidelines. Authorizes a state to use funds to establish or support a system of local or regional child care resource and referral organizations. Requires a state receiving funds under such Act to carry out at least two of specified activities affecting the quality of child care. Requires states receiving grant funds under such Act to carry out criminal background checks for child care staff members of child care providers. Makes ineligible for employment by a licensed, regulated, or registered child care provider any individual who: (1) refuses to consent to a criminal background check, (2) knowingly makes a materially false statement in connection with such a background check, (3) is registered or is required to be registered on a state sex offender registry or the National Sex Offender Registry, or (4) has been convicted of one or more specified felonies. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to operate a national toll-free hotline and website. Defines \"child with a disability\" as one under age 13 who is eligible for early intervention services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act."
