Directs the Secretary of the Interior, through the National Park Service (NPS), to study the feasibility of including additional cultural and historical sites in Huerfano and Las Animas Counties in the Park. Allows the Secretary to acquire water rights by donation or purchase from willing sellers. Requires the completion of a general management plan for the Park. Requires the head of the federal agency having jurisdiction over a part of the Old Spanish Trail that is included within the Park to continue to manage that part of the Trail."
