    "text": "Government Employee Accountability Act - Sets forth guidelines for placing career employees of the Senior Executive Service (SES) on investigative leave. Defines \"investigative leave\" as a temporary absence without duty for disciplinary reasons, for not more than 90 days. Authorizes a federal agency to: (1) place an SES employee on investigative leave, without loss of pay and without charge to annual or sick leave, only for alleged misconduct, neglect of duty, malfeasance, or misappropriation of funds; (2) place such employee on leave without pay if such employee's alleged conduct is determined to be serious or flagrant; or (3) remove such employee if such employee acted in a manner that endangers the interest of the agency mission. Requires an agency to periodically review the investigation into the conduct of an SES employee placed on investigative leave and take certain actions with respect to such employee at the end of a period of investigative leave, including removal, suspension without pay, or reinstatement to duty. Grants an employee placed on investigative leave certain rights, including: (1) advance written notice of, and a reasonable time (not less than seven days) to answer, charges; (2) the right to be represented by an attorney; and (3) the right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). Includes misappropriation of funds as a ground in suspending or reinstating an SES employee or placing such employee in another civil service position."
