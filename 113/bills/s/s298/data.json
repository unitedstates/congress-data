Security Council Resolutions 1695, 1718, and 1874; the February 12, 2013 test of the nuclear device is a clear and provocative violation of Security Resolution 2087; North Korea continues to defy the U.N., its Six-Party partners, and the international community; U.N. member states should implement and enforce sanctions imposed by these resolutions and censure North Korea; North Korea should dismantle its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs, cease its proliferation activities, and comply with all relevant resolutions and its commitments; restrictions against North Korea should remain in effect until it no longer threatens the United States, our allies, and global peace; the United States should seek a new round of Security Council sanctions; U.N. member states should strengthen efforts to prevent the transfer of military and dual-use technologies to North Korea, monitor the activities of their nationals, financial institutions, and other entities with or on behalf of North Korean financial institutions, and prevent transshipments that relate to North Korean military, missile, and nuclear programs and proliferation activities; the United States should explore all appropriate measures for enhanced military operations by the U.S. Armed Forces in the Asia-Pacific region in order to safeguard U.S. national interests; and the United States should secure the agreement of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and General Assembly to adopt the recommendations made in the February 2013 report of Marzuki Darusman, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, that an inquiry mechanism should be established to investigate North Korea's systematic violations of human rights, as well as to analyze whether crimes against humanity are being perpetrated in North Korea. Directs the Secretary of State to conduct and submit to Congress a comprehensive report on U.S. policy towards North Korea. States that nothing in this Act shall be construed as a declaration of war or an authorization for the use of force against North Korea."
