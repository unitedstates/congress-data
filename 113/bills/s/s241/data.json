Requires incorporation into the relevant wilderness area of any land or interests in land within the boundaries of such wilderness areas acquired by the United States. Sets forth requirements for the management of the wilderness areas regarding: (1) livestock grazing, (2) the creation of protective perimeters and buffer zones, and (3) the jurisdiction of the state of New Mexico respecting fish and wildlife located on public land in New Mexico. Releases specified public land within the San Antonio Wilderness Study Area not designated as wilderness by this Act from further study for such a designation. Requires the wilderness areas to be administered as components of the National Landscape Conservation System. Withdraws any federal land within the wilderness areas, including any acquired land or interest, from: (1) entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; (2) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and (3) operation of the mineral leasing, mineral materials, and geothermal leasing laws. Denies that anything in this Act enlarges, diminishes, or otherwise modifies any treaty rights."
