Permits any person to file a petition for judicial review of such agency action. Defines \"economically significant regulation\" as one that: (1) has an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; or (2) adversely affects in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities."
