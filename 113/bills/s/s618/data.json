Requires the Secretary, in conducting each such study, to: (1) evaluate the national significance of the site and the area surrounding it, (2) determine the feasibility of designating such site as a unit of the National Park System, and (3) consider other alternatives for the preservation and interpretation of the site. Requires the Secretary to update the study authorized under the National Park Service Studies Act of 1999 relating to World War II sites in the Republic of Palau. Instructs the Secretary to: (1) determine whether conditions have changed to justify designating such sites as a System unit, and (2) consider other alternatives for the preservation and interpretation of those sites."
