Defines a QSNC as a clinic or network of clinics operated by a private non-profit or public entity at least 30% percent of whose patient volume is attributable to needy individuals. Defines a \"QSNC-based\" individual as one who furnishes substantially all of his or her professional services in a QSNC and through use of the clinic's facilities and equipment, including qualified EHRs. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a procedure through which a QSNC may demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology in order to receive incentive payments."
