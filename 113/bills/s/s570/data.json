Directs the Secretary of Energy, in establishing criteria for grants, to take into account: (1) regional disparities in the ways in which energy is produced and used, and (2) the clean energy resource potential of the measures. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to decrease the tax deduction for oil related qualified production activities income of major integrated oil companies."
