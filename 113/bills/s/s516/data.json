    "text": "Prostate Research, Outreach, Screening, Testing, Access, and Treatment Effectiveness Act of 2013 or PROSTATE Act - Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to establish the Interagency Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force, with duties to include: (1) developing a summary of advances in federal prostate cancer research and compile a list of best practices that warrant broader adoption in health care programs, (2) considering establishing guidance to enable physicians to allow screening of men over age 74, (3) coordinating information on federal research and health care program activities relating to prostate cancer, and (4) submitting recommendations regarding federal research and health care programs. Directs the Secretary to establish and carry out a program to coordinate and intensify prostate cancer research, including by developing advances in diagnostic and prognostic methods and tests, better understanding of the etiology of the disease, and establishment of clinical registries for prostate cancer and the award of research grants. Establishes in the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a Prostate Cancer Scientific Advisory Board to be responsible for accelerating real-time sharing of the latest research data and accelerating movement of new medicines to patients. Directs the Secretary of VA, the Secretary of Defense (DOD) and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish four-year telehealth pilot projects to analyze the clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness associated with telehealth services in a variety of geographic areas that contain high proportions of medically underserved populations as well as those in rural areas. Requires the Secretary of VA to develop a national education campaign for prostate cancer."
