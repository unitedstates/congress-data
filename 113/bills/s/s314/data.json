    "text": "Sudden Unexpected Death Data Enhancement and Awareness Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to award grants for: (1) improving state comprehensive death scene investigations for sudden unexplained infant death (SUID) and sudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC), and (2) increasing the rate of comprehensive and standardized autopsies for such deaths. Requires the Director to: (1) develop national guidelines for a standard autopsy protocol for such deaths, and (2) commission a study on the benefits and appropriateness of genetic testing for infant and early childhood deaths that remain unexplained after investigation and autopsy. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director, to: (1) award grants for death scene investigation training specific for SUID and SUDC; (2) modify the national death case reporting system to assure that such system provides for population-based data for ages 0-4 years of age and facilitates the understanding of the root causes, rates, and trends of SUID and SUDC with respect to such ages; (3) conduct a needs assessment for investigations and determinations of such deaths; (4) develop public education and prevention programs to reduce stillbirths and address the racial and ethnic disparities in occurrence; (5) award grants for surveillance efforts on stillbirths; and (6) develop and conduct public education and prevention program aimed at reducing stillbirths. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), to: (1) award grants for child death review programs and prevention strategies; (2) establish a public health awareness and education campaign on SUID and SUDC; and (3) award grants for support services to families who have experienced SUID, SUDC, or stillbirth. Requires the Secretary to establish a task force to develop a national research plan to determine the causes of, and how to prevent, stillbirths."
