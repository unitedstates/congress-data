Requires the Secretary to permit hunting, fishing, and trapping on land and water within the Preserve. Allows designation of zones and limited periods when hunting, fishing, or trapping shall not be permitted. Declares that nothing in this Act affects any jurisdiction or responsibility of the state of New Mexico respecting fish and wildlife in the Preserve. Directs the Secretary to undertake activities to improve the health of forest, grassland, and riparian areas within the Preserve.
