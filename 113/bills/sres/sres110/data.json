Amends Rule XVII (References to Committees; Motions to Discharge; Reports of Committees; and Hearings Available) of the Standing Rules of the Senate to make it out of order in the Senate to consider such a measure unless the committee of jurisdiction has prepared and posted on its website an overlapping and duplicative program analysis and explanation for the legislation that contains the same CRS analysis and committee explanation. Permits waiver of this resolution."
