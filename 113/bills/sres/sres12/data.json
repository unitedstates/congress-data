Honors the sacrifice made by the government and civil society of Haiti, the U.S. government, the United Nations (U.N.), and the international community in their response to those affected by the calamity. Reaffirms the Senate's solidarity with the government and people of Haiti. Supports the long-term reconstruction efforts of the United States in full cooperation with the government of Haiti, its Office of the Secretary of State for the Integration of Persons with Disabilities, and Haitian civil society, and with private sector support. Urges the President and the international community to: (1) focus assistance on increasing the Haitian public sector's capacity to provide services; (2) involve civil society in Haiti and the Haitian diaspora at all stages of the post-earthquake response; (3) provide programs that protect and involve vulnerable populations; and (4) enhance the government of Haiti's ability to improve economic development, attract investment, pursue judicial reform, enhance the rule of law, reduce gender-based violence, improve water and sanitation systems, and reform land tenure policies. Welcomes evidence of progress in building a better future for Haiti, including: (1) agricultural yields improvements via the Feed the Future initiative, (2) opening the Caracol Industrial Park in northern Haiti, (3) economic opportunity programs for women and survivors of sexual violence and reintegration assistance programs for Haitian migrants, (4) reduction of the cholera mortality rate and provision of HIV and AIDS services, and (5) recruitment and provisioning of new Haitian National Police officers. Urges the President to: (1) continue reconstruction and development efforts coordinated with the government of Haiti, the Haitian diaspora, and appropriate international actors; (2) ensure close monitoring of U.S. aid programs; and (3) work with the Government of Haiti and private landowners to prevent the forced eviction of internally displaced people and communities and to provide sustainable housing solutions for the most vulnerable people in Haiti."
