Urges that any election in Cambodia that the Secretary of State determines is not credible should be deemed an illegitimate expression of the will of the Cambodian people and an impediment to Cambodia's democratic development. States that a Cambodian government formed as a result of such illegitimate elections should not be eligible for direct U.S. assistance."
