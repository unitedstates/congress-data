Requires the motion to be signed by 16 Senators, including the Majority Leader, the Minority Leader, 7 additional Senators not affiliated with the majority, and 7 additional Senators not affiliated with the minority. Requires: (1) the Presiding Officer, or the clerk at the Presiding Officer's direction, to lay the motion before the Senate one hour after the Senate meets on the following calendar day; and (2) a vote on the motion, without further debate, if cloture is invoked. Amends Rule XXVIII (Conference Committees; Reports; Open Meetings) to make it in order, when a message from the House of Representatives is laid before the Senate, for a single, non-divisible motion to be made that includes motions to: (1) disagree to a House amendment or to insist upon a Senate amendment, (2) request a committee of conference with the House or to agree to a request by the House for a committee of conference, and (3) authorize the Presiding Officer to appoint conferees (or a motion to appoint conferees). Limits to two hours any debate, equally divided in the usual form, on a cloture motion presented on such motions. Requires: (1) the Presiding Officer, or the clerk at the Presiding Officer's direction, to lay the motion before the Senate; and (2) a vote on the motion, without further debate, if cloture is invoked."
