Authorizes suspension of these prohibitions by concurrent resolution approved by a three-fifths vote of the Senate and a two-thirds vote of the House of Representatives. Requires the President, before each fiscal year, to transmit to Congress a proposed federal budget for that fiscal year in which total outlays do not exceed total revenues received by the United States."
