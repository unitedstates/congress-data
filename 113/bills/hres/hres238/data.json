Commends: (1) the Obama administration and its predecessors for their commitment to Israel's survival and security and for their efforts to promote a resolution of the conflict through Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, and (2) the Obama administration for supporting Israel's Iron Dome Missile Defense System. Calls on: (1) Hamas to recognize Israel's right to exist, denounce violence, and abide by existing agreements; (2) states, international organizations, and individuals to oppose efforts to deny the Jewish people's historical, cultural, and spiritual connection to Israel; (3) Arab and Muslim-majority states to work towards full normalization of state-to-state relations with Israel; (4) the Israeli government to prevent further settlement expansion in the Occupied Territories; and (5) Israel and Hamas to uphold the existing cease fire agreement. Applauds President Obama's recent efforts to initiate a new, diplomatic effort to achieve an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement."
