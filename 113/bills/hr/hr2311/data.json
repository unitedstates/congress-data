    "text": "Worker Anti-Retaliation Act - Prohibits an employer (or any of its agents) from discharging or in any other manner discriminating or taking or threatening adverse action against any employee that disseminates or assists in the dissemination of any message on the employer's property or elsewhere, including through images, picketing, work stoppages, or gathering in groups to protest conflicts with employers or to persuade them to change working conditions, if the employees do not have a representative for collective bargaining and their actions: (1) were peaceful and not taken during work time, except during a lawful work stoppage; and (2) did not destroy or damage the employer's property or block the employer's entrances or exits or otherwise impede the employer's operations or the work of other employees. Applies this same employer prohibition regarding any employee who planned any of these actions or assisted, encouraged, or supported another employee in engaging in them. Limits this prohibition to any employer whose annual gross revenue, when added to the annual gross revenue of its parent corporation and all of its affiliates, exceeds $5 million (exclusive of excise taxes at the retail level that are separately stated). Prohibits such an employer from providing for an employee's defense, backpay, damages, or settlement if that employee is found to be in violation of the requirements of this Act."
