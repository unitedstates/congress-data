Requires the Archivist of the United States to publish such information on the website of the National Archives within 30 days after each quarterly filing. Makes it unlawful for contributors or fundraising organizations to knowingly and willfully submit false information or omit material information. Prescribes criminal penalties for violation of such prohibitions."
