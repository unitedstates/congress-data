Provides that participation by an employee, acting in an official capacity, in an in-person or telephonic interaction shall constitute consent by such employee to a recording of that interaction by any participant in the interaction. Requires written notice to an individual or a representative of the right to record conversations involving an enforcement action. Makes any employee who violates the requirements of this Act subject to disciplinary action. Requires: (1) each executive agency to post on its website information explaining the right of individuals to record interactions with employees, and (2) the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue guidance to executive agencies on implementation of the requirement to provide such information."
