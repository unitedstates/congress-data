    "text": "Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner Deployment Act or SANE Deployment Act - Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 to direct the Secretary of each military department to assign at least one Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner-Adult/Adolescent (Examiner) to each brigade or equivalent unit level under that Secretary's jurisdiction, unless assignment to other units is determined to be more practicable and effective by the Secretary of Defense (DOD). Allows the assignment of more than one Examiner as necessary based on the demographics or needs of a unit. Allows for the waiver of such assignment for a specific unit level if a department Secretary determines that compliance will impose an undue burden, but requires congressional notification and justification therefor. Requires that, on and after October 1, 2015, only members of the Armed Forces and civilian DOD employees may be assigned as Examiners. Requires appropriate Examiner training and certification."
