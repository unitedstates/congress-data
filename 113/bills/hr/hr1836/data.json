Directs the Attorney General to appoint qualified tribal prosecutors and other qualified attorneys to assist in prosecuting federal offenses committed in the Indian country of at least ten federally recognized tribes. Gives a preference to those tribes that have the highest rates of domestic violence and sexual assault. Directs the Comptroller General to report to Congress on: (1) the prevalence of domestic violence and sexual assault in Indian country, (2) the efforts of federal law enforcement agencies to investigate those crimes, and (3) federal initiatives to help address and prevent such violence."
