States that such program shall: (1) be carried out under a cooperative agreement between USAID and one or more institutions with a successful record of advancing the technologies described in this Act and integrating practical field experience into the research and development process, and (2) codify the Health Technologies program under which USAID supports the development of technologies for global health. States that USAID's Center for Accelerating Innovation and Impact shall continue its work to speed the development, introduction, and scale-up of priority global health interventions. Directs USAID to report annually to Congress on USAID research and development activities."
