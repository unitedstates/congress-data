Outlines governing principles for the provision of U.S. humanitarian assistance to address the Syrian conflict. Authorizes assistance for the protection of women, children, and other vulnerable populations affected. Prohibits any assistance to an entity that has attacked or prevented the operation or activities of health care facilities or providers. Authorizes the Secretary of State to provide additional humanitarian assistance to Syria. Earmarks funds authorized under this Act for Syrian opposition-allied local coordination committees and the provision of U.S. civilian broadcasting to Syria. Requires assistance funds to be marked as being \"From the American People\" and to include a representation of the U.S. flag. Expresses the sense of Congress supporting the provision of appropriate military assistance for vetted Syrian opposition forces. Authorizes the President to direct the drawdown of Department of Defense (DOD) defense articles and services, and to provide military education and training, for such forces. Authorizes the President to: establish a program to facilitate the destruction of Syrian chemical and biological weapons, other weapons of mass destruction, and associated parts and equipment; provide assistance, make contributions, and use the U.S. voice, vote, and influence to provide post-Assad governmental transition assistance to Syria; and temporarily suspend certain sanctions against Syria in the event of a post-Assad government which meets specified requirements. Provides temporary personnel authorities in connection with aiding Syria in the establishment of a post-regime government."
