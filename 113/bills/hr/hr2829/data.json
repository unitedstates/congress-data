Requires all such forms to include a statement specifying the penalty for perjury in an application for voter registration. Prohibits states from registering an individual to vote in federal elections unless they verify that the information provided in the individual's application is correct. Requires the head of an office of the federal government, upon request, to enter into an agreement with the chief state election official to enable the official to verify the eligibility of such an applicant."
