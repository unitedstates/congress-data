Directs the Secretary of Defense to: (1) identify areas in which commonality with other unmanned aircraft systems across the UAS portfolio will be achieved, (2) request a federally-funded research and development center to conduct an independent study on UAS interoperability and overlap issues, (3) report to Congress on the examination of the UAS portfolio and the UAS independent study, and (4) issue revised excess inventory management guidance and report to Congress on such guidance. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for the denial, revocation, or limitation of a passport or passport card for individuals with a seriously delinquent tax debt in excess of $50,000. Prohibits the Secretary of State from issuing a passport to an individual with a seriously delinquent tax debt and requires the Secretary to revoke the passport of such an individual, with an exception for emergency circumstances or humanitarian reasons. Allows disclosure of tax return information to the Secretary for purposes of processing passports of individuals with a seriously delinquent tax debt. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to report on the merits and feasibility of converting from a retrospective antidumping and countervailing duty collection system to a prospective one, including an estimate of costs and cost savings resulting from such a conversion. Requires the Inspector General of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to report on the effectiveness of each USAID foreign assistance program and project. Directs the Attorney General to convert by 2015 all X-ray systems in federal prisons from analog, film-based systems to digital, filmless systems. Prohibits the Secretary of the Treasury from minting or issuing any coin, or engraving or printing any U.S. currency, that costs more to produce than the denomination of such coin or currency. Requires the Public Printer of the Government Printing Office (GPO) to make any document of the House of Representatives or Senate available only in an electronic format accessible through the Internet and prohibits the printing or distribution of a printed copy of any such document, with a limited exception for requests by any person for whom the Public Printer would have been required to provide a printed copy."
