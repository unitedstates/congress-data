Allows a maximum credit amount of $4,500 ($2,250 for a married individual filing a separate return). Defines \"scholarship granting organization\" as a tax-exempt entity whose exclusive purpose is to provide scholarships for the tuition and other expenses of elementary and secondary school students from low income households (i.e., household income not exceeding 250% of federal poverty guidelines). Allows corporate taxpayers a tax credit, up to $100,000, for contributions to a scholarship granting organization. Imposes a penalty on scholarship granting organizations that fail to distribute at least 90% of their total receipts for elementary and secondary school expenses in a taxable year."
