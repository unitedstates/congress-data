    "text": "Military Health Care Affordability Act - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) so long as the United States sends men and women into battle, the United States will be faithful to care for them upon their return; (2) as the veteran answered the call of duty, so too, is the United States duty-bound to answer the call of the veteran; and (3) the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) have the tools and ingenuity to provide continued excellent health care without increasing TRICARE payments from the veteran before fiscal year 2014. Extends through FY2015 (under current law, through FY2011) the prohibition on increases in certain health care costs and restrictions on health benefit adjustments for members of the Armed Forces, retirees, and their dependents, including charges and premiums under TRICARE (a DOD managed care program) and cost-sharing requirements under the DOD pharmacy benefits program."
