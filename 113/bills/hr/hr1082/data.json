Requires the deposits to begin the day after such Monday and to be released to the President on the earlier of: the day on which he submits the budget, or the last day of his term of office in which such first Monday occurs. Makes this requirement inapplicable to a budget required to be submitted by the President within 30 days after: the commencement date of the term for which the President is elected; or the date as of which a successor fills a vacancy in the office of the President which resulted from his removal from office, death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of such office."
