Requires the small business to notify the federal agency that issued the rule or regulation that it has elected such exemption, and makes the exemption effective 30 days after such notification. Requires an exempt small business to: (1) label any product affected by the exemption as no longer subject to such rule or regulation, and (2) include in any communication relating to the affected product or activity a notice that it is no longer so subject. Provides penalties for small business noncompliance with such requirements. Prohibits a small business from electing to be exempt from a rule or regulation issued by the Department of Defense (DOD) or Homeland Security (DHS) if the Secretary of Defense or Homeland Security has determined that the rule or regulation is necessary for U.S. security."
