    "text": "Helping Save Americans' Health Care Choices Act of 2013 - Amends\u00a0the\u00a0Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to repeal: (1) the 20%\u00a0penalty for distributions from a health savings account (HSA) or an Archer medical savings account (Archer MSA) not used for qualified medical expenses, (2) the prohibition on distributions from an HSA for over-the-counter drugs, and (3) the limitation on health flexible spending arrangements under cafeteria plans. Allows the treatment of a high deductible health plan as a qualified health plan under PPACA. Amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to allow: (1) a retirement savings tax credit for contributions to an HSA; (2) payment of premiums for high deductible health plans from an HSA; (3) a tax deduction for medical expenses incurred prior to the establishment of an HSA; (4) an increase of the HSA maximum allowable contribution amount to match the limit on deductible and out-of-pocket expenses under an HSA; (5) an exclusion from gross income of employer-provided coverage for qualified long-term care services that is provided through a flexible spending or similar arrangement; (6) eligibility for veterans with a service-connected disability, participants in Tricare, and certain Medicare beneficiaries for participation in an HSA; (7) both spouses to make catch-up contributions to the same HSA account; and (8) a tax deduction for amounts paid by patients to their primary physician in advance for the right to receive medical services on an as-needed basis. Renames IRC section headings relating to high deductible health plans as HSA qualified health plans. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, through regulations or other guidance, to encourage administrators of health plans and trustees of HSAs to provide for simultaneous enrollment in high deductible health plans and setup of HSAs."
