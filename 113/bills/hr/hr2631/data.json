Directs the the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) submit to Congress within 90 days a plan to implement a biometric exit capability using a person's fingerprints at all land, sea, and air ports of entry under the US-VISIT program; and (2) establish the biometric entry and exit data system required by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 within one year at each airport that is a U.S. port of entry, and within two years at all U.S. ports of entry."
