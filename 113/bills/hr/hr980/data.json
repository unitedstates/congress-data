    "text": "Coal Accountability and Retired Employee Act of 2013 or CARE Act - Amends the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 to transfer specified excess funds derived from coal mine operator-paid reclamation fees to the trustees of the 1974 United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) Pension Plan for use solely to pay pension benefits required under such Plan. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to revise 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan eligibility requirements. Makes eligible for health benefits from the 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan an individual who would be eligible to receive benefits from the 1974 UMWA Benefit Plan (with a specified exception) following a bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding of a coal mine operator, but who does not receive from that operator or any related person health benefits at least equal to those received under the Multiemployer Health Benefit Plan of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. Prescribes a special rule to state that employer contributions to an employees' trust or annuity benefit plan providing supplemental benefits solely to participants in a pension plan are neither deductible nor nondeductible as such from the employer's gross income. Subjects such contributions, on the other hand, to the requirements for deduction as an allowable trade or business expense. Treats a trust holding the assets of such a pension benefit plan as a tax-exempt organization. Excludes from wages any payments made to, or on behalf of, an employee or his or her beneficiary under such a plan."
