(Under the loan initiative, SBA lenders make partially guaranteed, lower-dollar small business loans which often benefit businesses in underserved areas or markets.) Makes pilot program loan guarantee percentage limits inapplicable to such Program. Authorizes the Administrator to increase the Program's maximum loan amount, reduce the Program's fees, and further streamline the Program's loan approval process."
