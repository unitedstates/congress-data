Requires the Secretary to: (1) evaluate the national significance of the study area; (2) determine the suitability and feasibility of designating the study area as a unit of the National Park System; (3) consider other alternatives for preservation, protection, and interpretation of the study area by federal, state, or local governmental entities, or private and nonprofit organizations; and (4) determine the effect of the designation as a System unit on existing commercial and recreational activities as well as the authorization, construction, and operation of energy production and transmission infrastructure, and the effect on the authority of state and local officials to manage those activities. Directs the Secretary also to identify any authorities, including condemnation, that will compel or permit the Secretary to influence or participate in local land use decisions (such as zoning) or place restrictions on non-federal land if the study area is designated as a System unit."
