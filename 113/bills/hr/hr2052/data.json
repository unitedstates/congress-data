Directs the Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the Federal Interagency Investment Working Group and the heads of other relevant federal agencies, to conduct an interagency review of the U.S. global competitiveness in attracting foreign direct investment and report to Congress recommendations for increasing that U.S. global competitiveness without weakening labor, consumer, financial, or environmental protections."
