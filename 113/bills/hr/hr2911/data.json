    "text": "Wireless Microphone Users Interference Protection Act of 2013 - Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to expand eligibility for specified licenses authorizing the operation of low power auxiliary stations to the owners of, and operators of events and performances at: amusement parks, arenas, convention centers, educational facilities, houses of worship, lodging facilities, museums, outdoor venues, recording studios, and theaters. Requires the FCC to: (1) expand scope of service and permissible transmission regulations to include the use of wireless microphones in rehearsals and live or recorded events and performances by such licensees, and (2) establish two safe haven channels for exclusive use by wireless microphone users. Directs the FCC to authorize owners and operators of wireless microphones to have access to TV bands databases to protect wireless microphone operations from interference. (The purpose of the TV bands database is to provide unlicensed Television Band Devices [TVBDs] with the available TV channels at the TVBD's location and to register fixed TVBDs and other locations protected from interference that are not otherwise recorded in FCC licensing databases.) Permits restaurants, as well as the persons and entities made eligible for licenses by this Act, to be registered in such databases as sites where wireless microphone operations shall be protected from interference."
