Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to ensure that a loan used for such purchase in a corporation that has been reviewed and approved by a lender approved by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) is not denied. Authorizes the Secretary to advertise the availability of such loan guarantees."
