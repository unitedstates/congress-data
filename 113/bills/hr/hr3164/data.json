    "text": "Declares that Congress and the executive branch are expressly and equally bound by any federal law which is intended to be broadly enforced upon the American people. Makes the following individuals ineligible for any federally funded health care premium subsidies, until the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) is fully repealed: a Member or employee of Congress, the President, the Vice President, any employee of the Executive Office of the President, and any other civilian federal worker. Exempts from such restriction a health care premium subsidy: under titles XVIII (Medicare) or XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act; for coverage under a veterans' health care program; or for medical coverage for members of the Armed Forces and their dependents, including coverage under the TRICARE program. Amends PPACA to restrict the health plans that the federal government may make available to Members of Congress and any employee of Congress, the President, the Vice President, any employee of the Executive Office of the President, and any other civilian federal worker, to only those health plans that are created under PPACA or offered through an American Health Benefit Exchange (a state health insurance exchange established under PPACA). (Currently, this restriction applies to Members of Congress and congressional staff.) Prohibits such restrictions from affecting: (1) the eligibility of an individual to enroll in a health plan or receive health care under specified uniformed services, TRICARE, or veterans' health programs; and (2) the continued coverage of annuitants in certain plans under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program in effect as of the enactment of this Act."
