    "text": "National Forest Emergency Response Act - Declares that the fire hazard and human endangerment in national forests to be designated by the Secretary of Agriculture constitute emergency circumstances. Directs the Secretary to designate (for up to 10 years) at least one national forest in each state that is experiencing conditions that constitute emergency circumstances due to pine beetle infestation, drought, disease, or storm damage and the resulting imminent risk of devastating wildfire that poses significant threat to the economic stability of surrounding areas and the health, safety, and well-being of residents, firefighters, and visitors. Makes provisions of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act regarding hazardous fuel reduction on federal land (including environmental analysis requirements, the special administrative review process, and the judicial review process) applicable to all Forest Service projects and activities implementing the land and resource management plan developed for the designated national forests during the term of the emergency circumstances, subject to specified modifications by the Secretary. Requires a project conducted in a designated national forest under this Act that comprises less than 10,000 acres (with exceptions, including components of the National Wilderness Preservation System, any federal land on which the removal of vegetation is restricted or prohibited by Act of Congress or presidential proclamation, or a congressionally designated wilderness study area) to be considered an action categorically excluded from the requirements for an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement. Prohibits a U.S. court from issuing any restraining order, preliminary injunction, or injunction pending appeal regarding any decision to engage in remedial action or to prepare, advertise, offer, award, or operate a timber sale in a designated forest. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into a cooperative agreement or contract with a state forester to provide forest, rangeland, and watershed restoration and protection services on national forest system land in that state."
