Requires the Committee to study: the types of information the federal government should collect and report on institutions of higher education (IHEs) to assist students and families in their search for an IHE, including information related to postsecondary education costs, financial assistance, student outcomes, and postgraduation earnings; how that information should be collected and reported, including how to disaggregate student outcome information by student subgroups; and ways in which the federal government could make that information more readily available to students and their families in an easily accessible and understandable format, and to states, local governments, secondary schools, IHEs, and private-sector entities. Requires the Committee, in conducting the study, to: (1) review relevant research concerning the types of information students and parents seek in searching for an IHE; (2) consider the utility of the information currently reported and whether additional information would be beneficial or confusing; and (3) consult with parents, students, and a broad range of parties interested in higher education. Directs the Committee to submit an interim and final report on the study to Congress and the Secretary. Requires the Committee, after consulting with the Commissioner of Education Statistics, to include in its final report recommendations for legislative, regulatory, and administrative actions to improve the information the federal government collects and reports on IHEs."
