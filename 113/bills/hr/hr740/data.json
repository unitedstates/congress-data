    "text": "Southeast Alaska Native Land Entitlement Finalization and Jobs Protection Act - (Sec. 4) Gives Sealaska, the regional Alaska Native Corporation for southeast Alaska, 90 days following this Act's enactment to agree to accept the conveyance of specified federal land, subject to certain conditions and restrictions, as full and final satisfaction of its remaining land entitlement under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). Provides that if Sealaska fails to agree to that conveyance: (1) this Act's provisions cease to be effective; and (2) the Secretary of the Interior shall complete, within 27 month's of this Act's enactment, the interim conveyance of Sealaska's remaining land entitlement under the ANCSA from prioritized selections on file with the Secretary on the date of this Act's enactment. (Sec. 5) Identifies the lands to be conveyed upon Sealaska's agreement as: (1) the 25 parcels of federal land comprising approximately 69,235 acres that are generally depicted as \"Sealaska Selections\" on certain Sealaska Land Entitlement Finalization maps, and (2) up to 127 cemetery sites and historical places that Sealaska must apply for and that comprise up to 840 acres of federal land. Includes with those conveyances: (1) public easements under the ANCSA, (2) a ten-year easement for Forest System research activities on study plots, and (3) an easement providing Sealaska access to and the use of the log transfer facility at Shipley Bay on Kosciusko Island. Keeps any part of those 25 parcels of conveyed lands that are outside ANCSA withdrawal areas open for subsistence and noncommercial recreational uses by the public. Allows Sealaska to impose reasonable restrictions on public access to and across the conveyed lands. (Sec. 7) Requires Sealaska to allow existing guiding or outfitting special use permit holders to continue to operate on the conveyed lands for the remainder of the permit term and a subsequent ten-year renewal period. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture and Sealaska, within one year of this Act's enactment, to enter into negotiations for an agreement regarding the use of: (1) National Forest System roads and related transportation facilities by Sealaska, and (2) Sealaska roads and related transportation facilities by the Forest Service. Renames certain culturally and historically significant trade and migration routes and keeps them open for travel by Sealaska and the public. Amends the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004 to allow Alaska Native Corporations to enter into agreements with the federal government under that Act regarding their lands that are forested or formerly had vegetative cover and are capable of restoration. Amends the National Historic Preservation Act to allow an Alaska Native tribe, band, nation or other organized group or community to participate in historic site preservation programs administered on behalf of Indian tribes, including by securing support to manage their own historic preservation sites and programs."
