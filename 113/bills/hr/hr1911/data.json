Sets the annual interest rate on Direct Consolidation loans for which an application is received on or after July 1, 2013, at the weighted average of the interest rates on the loans consolidated, rounded to the nearest higher one-eighth of 1%. (Sec. 3) Provides that the budgetary effects of this Act shall not be entered on specified PAYGO scorecards.
