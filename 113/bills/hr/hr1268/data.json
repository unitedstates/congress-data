Defines \"qualified taxpayer\" as: (1) a taxpayer who is the holder of a flood insurance policy under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and who owns insured property for which the chargeable premium rate under such policy was increased or will increase and which has an elevation lower than the base flood elevation or is located in an area designated as having a higher flood risk, and (2) a small business with 50 or fewer employees. Terminates such credit after 2022. Authorizes appropriations to the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to carry out: (1) the predisaster hazard mitigation program authorized by the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, and (2) the flood mitigation assistance program authorized by the National Flood Insurance Act of 1969. Specifies that such funds may be used only for mitigation activities and acquisition by states and communities of properties located in higher flood risk areas. Terminates the Energy Star program of the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and rescinds any amounts not obligated or expended for such program."
