Requires the part of the Rogue River, which lies within the Wild Rogue Wilderness, including the Wilderness additions, and was designated under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act as a component of the System in 1968, to be managed as a wild river. Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to add specified segments of creeks to the designation of the Rogue River in Oregon as a component of the national wild and scenic rivers system. Prohibits: (1) the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) from licensing the construction of any dam, water conduit, reservoir, powerhouse, transmission line, or other project works affecting specified stream segments; and (2) any federal department or agency from assisting in the construction of any water resources project affecting any such segment, except for maintaining or repairing existing projects."
