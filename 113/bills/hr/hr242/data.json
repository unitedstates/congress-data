Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to establish: (1) a nonimmigrant temporary agricultural worker program (W-visa) which shall include annual numerical limitations and monthly limitations based on enrollment requests, historical agricultural employment needs, and the reports of U.S. workers applying for agricultural employment; and (2) a trust fund to administer and enforce the program and provide a monetary incentive for such workers to return to their countries upon visa expiration. Sets forth program provisions, including: (1) enrollment requirements, (2) a visa preference allocation system, (3) a biometric identification card requirement, (4) U.S. worker protections, and (5) visa increases due to extraordinary and unusual employment circumstances. Makes such agricultural workers ineligible for need-based federal financial assistance."
