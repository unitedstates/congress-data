Amends the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007 to: (1) repeal a provision prohibiting the Secretary from disapproving a site security plan based on the presence or absence of a particular security measure, (2) require vulnerability assessments and site security plans to be treated as sensitive security information, and (3) repeal a provision limiting to the Secretary any right of action against a chemical facility owner or operator to enforce security measures."
