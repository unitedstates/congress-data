Requires the Secretary to select one four-year public university, one community college, and one private nonprofit college at which to conduct the pilot program. Requires the pilot program to provide peer-outreach and peer-support services to students at such institutions who are veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn by employing veterans who: (1) are using, or have successfully used, their entitlement to educational assistance; and (2) have served on active duty in a theater of combat operations. Directs the Secretary to provide training to the veterans employed by the pilot program and to develop requirements and measures for assessing the effectiveness of program services."
