Requires violators to be punished as a court-martial may direct. Defines \"covered military instructors\" as drill sergeants in the Army, drill instructors in the Marine Corps, recruit division commanders in the Navy, military training instructors in the Air Force, company commanders in the Coast Guard, and such other members as the Secretary concerned may designate as having supervisory authority over new recruits undergoing basic training or its equivalent. Prohibits consent from being a defense in any such prosecution."
