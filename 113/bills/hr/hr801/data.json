Requires termination of such registration after a savings and loan holding company certifies that its holders of record of such class of security has been reduced to fewer than 1,200 persons. Suspends automatically the duty of a savings and loan holding company to file supplementary and periodic information if the securities of each class to which the registration statement relates (other than any class of asset-backed securities) are held of record by fewer than 1,200 persons."
