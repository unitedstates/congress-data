Requires an agency head, after the completion of any cost-benefit or regulatory impact analysis used to promulgate rules or guidelines or to determine administrative actions, to: (1) submit to relevant congressional committees a report on the result of, and methods (including any method that determines the social cost of carbon) used to calculate, the cost-benefits or regulatory impact analysis; and (2) publish such report in the Federal Register. Prohibits the finalization of any cost-benefit or regulatory impact analysis for 60 days after the submission of such report and requires an agency head, during such 60-day period, to evaluate the potential benefits of each cost-benefit or regulatory impact analysis using specified criteria."
