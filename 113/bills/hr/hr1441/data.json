Requires the Attorney General to: inform such employers about how to request background checks; complete a check of the national criminal history records system; establish procedures for the secure receipt of criminal history records; make determinations regarding whether the criminal history records received in response to a background check indicate a criminal history that may bear on the employee's or prospective employee's fitness for employment in such industry based on whether that individual has, during the preceding 10 years, been convicted of or imprisoned for a felony or an offense involving dishonesty, false statement, or the use of force against another; convey such fitness determination to the employer requesting the background check; provide an affected employee or prospective employee his or her criminal history records and notification of the right to challenge the accuracy or completeness of such records or to withdraw consent to participate in the determination; collect fees from employers to offset fitness determination costs; and issue regulations to ensure the enforcement of nondisclosure requirements for criminal history records."
