Defines \"government-wide shutdown\" as any portion of a fiscal year during which none of the appropriation bills for the fiscal year have become law and an Act or joint resolution making continuing appropriations for the fiscal year is not in effect. Directs the Managing Trustee of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund (including the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund), during such a shutdown, to make available to the Commissioner of Social Security such amounts as the Commissioner determines to be necessary for the uninterrupted payment of monthly insurance benefits under SSA title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) and benefits under SSA title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI). Prohibits Members of Congress and the President from receiving basic pay during a government-wide shutdown and from receiving such forfeited pay retroactively."
