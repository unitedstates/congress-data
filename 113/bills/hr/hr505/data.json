    "text": "Balancing Act - Title I: Repeal Sequester - Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Controlled Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act), as amended by the Budget Control Act of 2011, to repeal certain sequestration requirements for enforcement of a specified budget goal. Title II: Close Tax Loopholes to Achieve Balance - Subtitle A: 28 Percent Limitation on Certain Deductions and Exclusions - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to limit tax deductions and other tax exclusions for taxpayers whose adjusted gross income exceeds $200,000 ($250,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return). Subtitle B: Tax Carried Interest in Investment Partnerships as Ordinary Income - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) set forth a special rule for the inclusion in gross income of partnership interests transferred in connection with the performance of services, (2) treat as ordinary income the net capital gain with respect to an investment services partnership interest except to the extent such gain is attributable to a partner's qualified capital interest, (3) exempt income from investment services partnership interests from treatment as qualifying income of a publicly-traded partnership, (4) increase the penalty for underpayments of tax resulting from failure to treat income from an investment services partnership interest as ordinary income, and (5) include income and loss from an investment services partnership interest for purposes of determining net earnings from self-employment and applicable self-employment taxes. Defines \"investment services partnership interest\" as any interest in a partnership acquired or held by a person who provides services to a partnership by: (1) advising the partnership about investing in, purchasing, or selling specified assets; (2) managing, acquiring, or disposing of specified assets; or (3) arranging financing with respect to acquiring specified assets. Subtitle C: Dual Capacity Taxpayers - Denies a foreign tax credit to a person who is subject to a levy of a foreign country or possession of the United States and who directly or indirectly receives an economic benefit from such country or possession (dual capacity taxpayer). Subtitle D: Close Exclusion of Foreign-Earned Income Loophole - Repeals the tax exclusion for foreign earned income. Subtitle E: Close S Corporation Loophole - Amends the Internal Revenue Code and title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to require certain shareholders of a subchapter S corporation engaged as a partner in a professional service business to include income or loss attributable to such business in their net earnings from self-employment for employment tax purposes. Defines a \"professional service business\" as any trade or business providing services in the fields of health, law, lobbying, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, athletics, investment advice or management, or brokerage services. Subtitle F: Limitation on Mortgage Interest Deduction With Respect to Boats - Eliminates the mortgage interest tax deduction for second residences that are boats.
