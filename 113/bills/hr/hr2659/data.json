    "text": "Opportunities for Success Act of 2013 - Directs the Secretary of Education to award grants to institutions of higher education for use in providing their students with financial support to engage in internships reasonably associated with their studies. Requires support recipients to be full-time or half-time students who are eligible for Federal Pell Grants. Sets the student support level for unpaid internships at: (1) the higher of the federal or state minimum wage for each hour of the internship, if the internship occurs while the student is enrolled in classes; and (2) the student's reasonable cost of living expenses, if the internship occurs while the student is not enrolled in classes. Sets the support level for paid internships by reducing the amount the student would receive for an unpaid internship by the amount the paid internship provides to the student. Caps the total support a student may receive for full-time and part-time internships. Makes that support nontaxable and excludes it from the calculation of a student's need or eligibility for financial assistance under title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965."
