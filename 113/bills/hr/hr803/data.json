    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "2013-03-15", 
    "text": "Supporting Knowledge and Investing in Lifelong Skills Act or SKILLS Act - Amends the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) to revise requirements and reauthorize appropriations for: (1) WIA title I, workforce investment systems for job training and employment services; and (2) WIA title II, adult education and family literacy education programs. Title I: Amendments to the Workforce Investment Act of 2012 - Subtitle A: Workforce Investment Definitions - (Sec. 101) Defines \"accrued expenditures,\" \"administrative costs,\" \"at-risk youth,\" \"industry or sector partnership,\" \"industry-recognized credential,\" \"recognized postsecondary credential,\" and \"pay-for-performance contract strategy.\" Revises other specified definitions. Subtitle B: Statewide and Local Workforce Investment Systems - (Sec. 103) Revises requirements for membership on a state workforce investment board (state board). Requires a state board to assist the state governor by developing: (1) policies and programs that support a comprehensive statewide workforce development system, and (2) a statewide workforce and labor market information system. (Sec. 104) Revises requirements for a state workforce development plan. Requires a plan to outline a three-year (currently five-year) strategy for the statewide workforce investment system. Requires a plan, in addition to current specified contents, to describe: (1) strategies and services to more fully engage employers and meet their needs, as well as those to assist at-risk youth and out-of-school youth in acquiring education, skills, credentials, and employment experience; (2) how the state board will convene industry or sector partnerships that lead to collaborative planning, resource alignment, and training efforts across multiple firms for a range of workers currently or potentially employed by a targeted industry cluster; (3) how the state will use technology to facilitate access to services in remote areas; (4) state actions to foster communication, coordination, and partnerships with non-profit organizations that provide employment-related, training, and complementary services; and (5) the process and methodology for determining one-stop partner program contributions for the cost of the infrastructure of one-stop centers, as well as the formula for allocating such infrastructure funds to local areas. Requires the state plan also to describe: (1) how the state will furnish employment, training, including training in advanced manufacturing, supportive, and placement services to veterans, including disabled and homeless veterans; and (2) the strategies and services that will be used to assist and expedite reintegration of homeless veterans into the labor force. (Sec. 105) Revises requirements for the designation of local workforce investment areas. Repeals the requirement that the state governor designate such areas. Requires the state, through the state board, to establish a process to make such designations. Requires a local or regional board, under such a process, to submit for state board approval an application for designation as a local area containing specified information. Eliminates automatic designations by a state governor upon the request of any area meeting certain criteria or on recommendation of a state board. Authorizes the state board to designate a state as a single state local area regardless of whether it was a single state service delivery area under the Job Training Partnership Act as of July 1, 1998. Allows a state to require the local boards for a designated region to prepare a single regional plan that incorporates the elements of the local plan and is approved in lieu of separate local plans. (Sec. 106) Revises requirements for local workforce investment boards. Repeals the requirement that representatives of labor organizations be included on a board. Changes from mandatory to discretionary, at the option of the chief elected official in the local area, the inclusion on a board of representatives of community-based organizations and of specified representatives of the local secondary school system, a postsecondary educational institution, or entities providing adult education and literacy activities. Adds representatives of veterans service organizations as possible board members at the discretion of the chief elected official in the local area. Requires a two-thirds majority of the board members to represent local area businesses. Repeals the requirement that the governing body of the concentrated employment program involved act in consultation with the chief elected official in the local workforce investment area to appoint members of the local board. Revises requirements for the functions of the local board. Requires the local board to conduct, and regularly update, a workforce research and regional labor market analysis and assist the governor in developing a statewide workforce and labor market information system. Renames core services a local board may provide through a one-stop delivery system as work ready services. (Sec. 107) Revises requirements for the comprehensive local plan and its contents, contracting its range from five years to three years. (Sec. 108) Revises requirements for the roles and responsibilities of one-stop partners in one-stop delivery systems. Removes from a one-stop delivery system any activities under the national system of public employment offices, welfare-to-work grants, and Older American community service employment program. Adds to the one-stop delivery system any activities of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) grant program under under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act. Requires each entity carrying out TANF activities to carry out the required one-stop partner activities, unless the state governor determines that they shall not. Removes from the list of human resource programs a one-stop partner may carry out any activities under a state employment and training program assisting members of households participating in the supplemental nutrition assistance program. Adds to the list of human resource programs a one-stop partner may carry out, however, other specified employment and training programs. Revises requirements for the provisions of a memorandum of understanding between the local board and a one-stop partner. Prescribes requirements for one-stop delivery systems. Requires the state board to establish objective procedures and criteria for certifying one-stop centers at least once every three years for the purpose of awarding one-stop infrastructure funding.

Authorizes a local board to use funds allocated to a local area to carry out incumbent worker training programs to assist incumbent workers in obtaining the skills necessary to retain employment and avert layoffs. Requires the state and local board, when providing employment and training activities, to give priority to placing participants in jobs in the private sector. Requires a local board (or the state at the request of the local board) to employ one or more veteran employment specialists in a local area to: (1) conduct outreach to local area employers to assist veterans, including disabled veterans, in gaining employment; and (2) facilitate employment, training, supportive, and placement services furnished to veterans, including disabled and homeless veterans, in the local area. (Sec. 114) Revises requirements for the performance accountability system, including core indicators of performance. Eliminates customer satisfaction indicators. Authorizes a state to establish an incentive system for local boards to implement pay-for-performance contract strategies for the delivery of employment and training services in a local area. (Sec. 115) Authorizes appropriations for employment and training activities for FY2014-FY2020. Subtitle C: Job Corps - (Sec. 116) Revises the principal purpose of the Job Corps to limit it to assisting at-risk youth to connect to the workforce by providing them with intensive academic, career and technical education, and service-learning opportunities to enable them to obtain regular secondary school diplomas and recognized postsecondary credentials leading to successful careers in in-demand industries that will result in opportunities for advancement. (Sec. 118) Raises the maximum age of individuals eligible for the Job Corps from 21 to 24. (Sec. 119) Eliminates from the sources with which implementation of standards and procedures for the recruitment, screening, and selection of eligible Job Corps applicants must be arranged community action agencies, business organizations, and labor organizations, and agencies and individuals that have contact with youth over substantial periods of time and are able to offer reliable information about the needs and problems of youth. Limits such arrangements to organizations that have a demonstrated record of effectiveness in placing at-risk youth into employment. Renders ineligible for enrollment in the Job Corps any individual who: (1) makes a false statement in connection with a criminal background check; (2) is registered or is required to be registered on a state sex offender registry or the National Sex Offender Registry; or (3) has been convicted of a felony consisting of homicide, child abuse or neglect, a crime against children, including child pornography, a crime involving rape or sexual assault, or physical assault, battery, or a drug-related offense committed within the past five years. (Sec. 120) Prohibits the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) from renewing the agreement for an entity to operate a Job Corps center if the center is ranked in the bottom quintile of centers for any program year. Allows such an entity to submit a new application only if it has shown significant improvement in performance indicators over the last program year. Specifies elements of systemic or substantial material failure that disqualify an entity from operating a Job Corps center. (Sec. 121) Makes completing secondary education and receiving a regular secondary school diploma one of the purposes of targeted Job Corps activities. Requires any operator seeking to enroll additional enrollees in an advanced career training program each year to demonstrate beforehand that: (1) program participants have achieved a satisfactory rate of completion and placement in training-related jobs, and (2) the operator has met or exceeded specified performance indicators for the previous year. (Sec. 122) Repeals the authority of the Secretary to provide counseling and job placement to former Job Corps enrollees. (Sec. 123) Replaces readjustment allowances for Job Corps graduates and former enrollees with transition allowances to graduates only. Requires the transition allowance to be incentive-based to reflect a graduate's completion of academic, career and technical education or training, and attainment of a recognized postsecondary credential, including an industry-recognized credential. (Sec. 124) Repeals the authority of the Secretary to require the operator of a Job Corps center to submit additional information, to become part of the center's operating plan, in order to remain eligible to operate the center. Prohibits a Job Corps center operator from using more than 10% of funds allotted to it for administrative costs. (Sec. 125) Revises requirements for Job Corps center participation in the community. Eliminates the requirement that each center have a Business and Community Liaison. Requires instead that the director of each Job Corps center encourage and cooperate in activities to establish a mutually beneficial relationship between Job Corps centers in the state and nearby communities, which may include use of any local workforce development boards to provide a mechanism for joint discussion of common problems and for planning programs of mutual interest. (Sec. 126) Changes the industry council, appointed by the center director, each Job Corps center is required to have to a workforce council appointed by the state governor. Revises requirements for council composition and responsibilities. (Sec. 127) Repeals the authority of the Secretary to carry out experimental, research, or demonstration projects relating to the Job Corps program. Directs the Secretary instead to provide technical assistance and training for the Job Corps program to improve its quality. (Sec. 129) Directs the Secretary to establish procedures to ensure that each Job Corps center operator, and each service provider, maintains a performance accountability system meeting certain criteria (in addition to the financial management information system required by current law). Prescribes primary and secondary performance indicators.Subtitle D: National Programs - (Sec. 130) Eliminates authority and requirements with respect to technical assistance to states that do not meet state performance measures with respect to employment and training activities for dislocated workers. Requires the Secretary to establish a system through which states may share information regarding best practices with regard to the operation of workforce investment activities. (Sec. 131) Requires the Secretary, through grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements, to conduct an independent evaluation of national programs and funded activities at least once every five years. Revises the requirement that such an evaluation cover the impact of the programs and activities on the community and participants involved to specify the impact of receiving services and not receiving services under such programs and activities on the community, businesses, and individuals. Adds quasi-experimental methods, impact analysis, and the use of administrative data to the list of research designs such evaluations must use. Reduces authorized appropriations by 10% for the fiscal year (and by an additional 10% for each subsequent fiscal year) in which the final results of an evaluation are not reported to Congress. Subtitle E: Administration - (Sec. 132) Changes from mandatory to discretionary the Secretary's authority to investigate an allegation of a violation of the requirements of federal labor law made by participants and other interested or affected parties. Revises limitations of the use of funds to prohibit their use for specified activities that are not directly related to the entry into employment, retention in employment, or increases in earnings of (currently, training for) eligible individuals. Prohibits the use of funds by a recipient or subrecipient to pay the salary and bonuses of an individual, either as direct costs or indirect costs, at a rate in excess of Level II of the Federal Executive Pay Schedule. Directs the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of the Department of Labor, headed by an Assistant Secretary appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to administer all workforce investment systems programs for job training and employment services and title III (Job Corps). Requires the Assistant Secretary to have substantial experience in workforce development and in workforce development management. (Sec. 134) Revises the requirement that funds made available to a state for administration of statewide workforce investment activities be allocable to the overall administration of workforce investment activities. Repeals the declaration that such funds need not be specifically allocable to: (1) the administration of adult employment and training activities; (2) the administration of dislocated worker employment and training activities; or (3) the administration of youth activities. (Sec. 135) Requires that each state, each local board, and each recipient (other than a subrecipient, subgrantee, or contractor of a recipient) receiving funds have the option to submit or disseminate electronically any reports, records, plans, or any other data required to be collected or disseminated. Requires the Secretary to submit to Congress all quarterly financial reports of local boards on programs and activities received from each state. (Sec. 136) Changes from July 1 to October 1 the start of a workforce investment systems program year. Repeals special rules for: (1) designation of service delivery areas for the delivery of workforce investment activities, and (2) state sanctioning of such areas for failure to meet performance measures for such activities. Authorizes the Secretary to establish, in lieu of current requirements for waiver requests and for conditions on waivers, an expedited procedure for the purpose of extending to additional states the waiver of statutory or regulatory requirements that have been approved for a state pursuant to a request. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring or imposing new or additional requirements, not specified under this Act, on a state in exchange for providing a waiver to the state or a local area in it. (Sec. 138) Exempts certain funds received by a public or private nonprofit entity, such as those raised privately from philanthropic foundations, businesses, or other private entities, from consideration as income with respect to the requirement that a public or private nonprofit entity may retain income from any program it administers only if it is used to continue to carry out the program. Prohibits the use of funds to establish or operate stand-alone fee-for-service enterprises, except one-stop centers, that compete with private sector employment agencies. (Sec. 139) Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to: (1) identify the number of federal government employees who work on or administer each of the workforce investment system programs authorized or repealed under this Act, (2) identify the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees who work on or administer any such programs that have been repealed or consolidated, and (3) reduce the federal government workforce by that number of FTE employees. Prohibits the use of funds for lobbying (with specified exceptions) and political activities (including voter registration activities). Subtitle F: State Unified Plan - (Sec. 140) Revises the kinds of programs and activities, including workforce investment system and adult education and literacy programs, that may be covered by a state unified plan. Grants the Secretary of Education the authority to approve state unified plans. (Currently, such plans are approved by the appropriate Secretary of the federal agency who exercises administrative authority over such programs or activities.) Prescribes requirements for the Secretary's approval of such plans. Authorizes a state, in developing a state unified plan, to consolidate additional federal employment and training funds allotted to it into the Workforce Investment Fund to improve the administration of state and local employment and training programs.
