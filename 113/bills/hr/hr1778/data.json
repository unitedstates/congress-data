Directs the Secretary of State to submit a semiannnual report to Congress for five years that identifies: (1) U.S. citizens imprisoned in foreign countries whose fundamental due process and human rights are being violated, (2) the due process and human rights violations that are being committed against such U.S. citizens, and (3) the government officials who are responsible for such violations or who are not fulfilling their official responsibility to protect such rights. Prohibits the Secretary of State from issuing any visa to, and the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) from permitting entry to the United States of, any such identified official and his or her immediate family members. Makes such ban permanent if an identified U.S. citizen dies while in foreign custody. Prohibits foreign assistance from being provided to an agency or other entity of a foreign government that is responsible for the violation of, or is failing to protect, the fundamental due process or human rights of an imprisoned U.S. citizen."
