Requires the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy to issue guidance to federal agencies for reinvigorating the role of the competition advocate. Requires OMB to issue government-wide savings goals for the strategic sourcing of goods and services by executive agencies. Requires agency chief information officers to report to OMB on agency efforts to identify and eliminate potentially duplicative information technology investment. Requires the Federal Chief Information Officer to develop and implement the Federal Data Center Optimization Initiative to optimize the usage and efficiency of federal data centers. Requires OMB to issue recommendations for reducing or consolidating the number of federal data centers by at least 40% by the end of FY2018 and by at least 80% by the end of FY2023. Rescinds unobligated budget authority for the Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program.

Amends the USEC Privatization Act to expand the definition of \"uranium\" for purposes of transfers and sales to include depleted uranium and any byproduct of uranium processing. Requires OMB to develop a strategy to assess the collective results of federal funding for the reduction of mobile source diesel emissions and to identify and eliminate any unnecessary duplication, overlap, and fragmentation of such activities.
