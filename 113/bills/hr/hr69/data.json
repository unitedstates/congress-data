    "text": "Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing Enforcement Act of 2013 - Amends the High Seas Driftnet Fishing Moratorium Protection Act to direct the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) and the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to enforce that Act and the Pacific Salmon Treaty Act of 1985, the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act, the Tuna Conventions Act of 1950, the North Pacific Anadromous Stocks Act of 1992, the South Pacific Tuna Act of 1988, the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Convention Act of 1984, the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975, the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Convention Act of 1995, and the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Convention Implementation Act. Amends several of such Acts as well as the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act, High Seas Fishing Compliance Act of 1995, Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982, and Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to revise violations, penalties, permit requirements, port privileges, illegal, unreported, or unregulated (IUU) fishing sanctions, and other enforcement authority. Authorizes additional enforcement measures relating to search or inspection of facilities or conveyances, records inspection, shipment detention, arrest, search and seizure, and service of civil or criminal process. Authorizes the Secretary to disclose certain information to state or federal agencies or internationally to ensure compliance with measures the Secretary enforces, including international fishery agreements. Authorizes: (1) the development and publication of a list of vessels engaged in IUU fishing, including vessels or owners identified by an international fishery management organization or arrangement made pursuant to an international fishery agreement; and (2) taking action against listed vessels. Requires identification and listing of nations that: (1) violate conservation and management measures required under an international fishery management agreement to which the United States is a party, or (2) fail to effectively address or regulate IUU fishing. Extends provisions applicable to nations to other entities that have competency to enter into international fishery management agreements. Authorizes international cooperation and assistance, including grants, to help other nations achieve sustainable fisheries. Antigua Convention Implementing Act of 2011 [sic] - Amends the Tuna Conventions Act of 1950 to revise provisions regarding: (1) the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, (2) the General Advisory Committee, (3) the Scientific Advisory Subcommittee, (4) prohibited acts, and (5) enforcement. Repeals the Eastern Pacific Tuna Licensing Act of 1984."
