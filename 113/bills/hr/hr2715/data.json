Defines \"qualified biomass fuel property expenditure\" as an expenditure for property which uses the burning of biomass fuel (a plant-derived fuel available on a renewable or recurring basis) to heat a dwelling used as a residence, or to heat water for use in such dwelling, and which has a thermal efficiency rating of at least 75%. Allows an energy tax credit until 2017 for investment in open-loop biomass heating property, including boilers or furnaces which operate at thermal output efficiencies of not less than 65% and provide thermal energy."
