Repeals a provision providing for such treatment of the surviving spouse of a veteran-owned and controlled small business after the death of a veteran-owner. Directs the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) that transfers from the Secretary to the Administrator control and administration of a required database of veteran-owned businesses."
