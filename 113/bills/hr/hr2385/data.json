(Currently, the Director is merely authorized to do so.) Repeals the requirement that the Director at all times provide compensation (including benefits) to each class of employees at least comparable to the compensation and benefits then being provided by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for the corresponding class of Federal Reserve employees. Repeals also the requirement that all such employees be compensated (including benefits) on terms and conditions consistent with specified terms and conditions of the Federal Reserve Act."
