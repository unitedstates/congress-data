Requires the Secretary to: (1) provide for the development of a standard definition of stillbirth and a standard protocol for stillbirth data collection and surveillance, and (2) carry out a national campaign to increase public and state awareness of such definition and protocol and public awareness and knowledge of stillbirths. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) should increase the allocation of funds and other resources for stillbirth research."
