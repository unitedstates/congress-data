Allows such costs to be calculated separately for individual, small group, or large group markets. Requires the Comptroller General (GAO) to study the methods of calculating the impact on average premium costs associated with: (1) guaranteed issuance of coverage and community rated premiums, (2) limitations on age rating, (3) required coverage of women's preventive services, and (4) the requirement that plans cover at least 60% of the actuarial value of essential health benefits."
