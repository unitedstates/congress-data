Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to transfer amounts appropriated for DOD by the Continuing Appropriations Resolution among DOD accounts. Requires account amounts, after such transfer, to be consistent with amounts appropriated or authorized for such accounts under a DOD appropriations or authorization Act for FY2013. Requires 15 days' advance notice of such transfers to the congressional defense and appropriations committees."
