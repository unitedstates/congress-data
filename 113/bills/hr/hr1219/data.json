Directs the Secretary of Commerce to publish a description and map of the applicable line along the coasts of such states. Prohibits the Secretary from suspending, revoking, terminating, or otherwise limiting the authority of any person under federal law to engage in fishing based on the person fishing for Gulf reef fish in waters subject to the exclusive authority of such states. Exempts such waters from specified federal regulatory requirements addressing fishery permits."
