Requires LEAs to use that grant to: (1) acquire real property; (2) construct new facilities; or (3) renovate, repair, or alter existing facilities for an elementary and secondary school that has experienced such a crisis. Prohibits the grant from covering more than 50% of an LEA's cost in taking such actions."
