Applies that calculation to forbearances: (1) that have been agreed to by the parties to an insured loan and approved by the insurer, or (2) for borrowers whose educational debt burden equals or exceeds 20% of their income. Applies that calculation to deferments for borrowers who: (1) are seeking and unable to find full-time employment, or (2) have or will experience an economic hardship."
