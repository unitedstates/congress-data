Requires each program to set forth a five-year VA plan to address the U.S. commitment to veterans and the resources necessary to meet that commitment. Requires the Secretary, in 2017 and quadrennially thereafter, to conduct a review of the strategy for meeting such commitment and resources requirement (quadrennial veterans review). Requires each review to be coordinated with the above program. Directs the Secretary to report to the congressional veterans committees on each review. Directs the Secretary to provide annually to the appropriate VA officials written policy guidance for the preparation and review of the planning and program recommendations and budget proposals of the VA elements of such officials. Requires the Secretary to designate a Chief Strategy Officer to advise the Secretary on long-range VA strategy and implications. Directs the Secretary to study (through an independent contractor) and report to the veterans committees on the functions and organizational structure of the Office of the Secretary and the VA, including the most efficient and economical allocation and structure for assisting the Secretary in carrying out duties and responsibilities."
