Requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in calculating the amount of the deficit reduction required for FY2013-FY2021 to enforce a specified budget goal under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, to further reduce the amount calculated for FY2013 by such appropriations for emergency job creation."
