Requires the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register a legal description and map of the public land to be transferred. Requires the transfer to be made without reimbursement, except that the Secretary of the Army shall reimburse the Secretary for any costs incurred in preparing the legal description and map. Requires the Secretary, if a grazing permit or lease exists for any part of such land to be transferred, to transfer or relocate the grazing allotments associated with such permit or lease to other public land that is acceptable to the permit or lease holder so that the grazing continues to have the same value to such holder. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to: (1) establish a reservation in favor of the United States with respect to any water or water right on lands transferred by this Act, or (2) authorize the appropriation of water on lands transferred by this Act except in accordance with applicable state law. Withdraws such land from all forms of appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining laws and geothermal leasing laws, so long as such lands remain under the Secretary of the Army's administrative jurisdiction."
