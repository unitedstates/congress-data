    "text": "Amends the Children's Gasoline Burn Prevention Act to require each portable fuel container manufactured for sale in the United States and intended for use by consumers to conform to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International standard specifications for: (1) child resistance of portable fuel containers for consumer use; (2) cautionary labeling of portable gasoline, kerosene, and diesel containers for consumer use; and (3) portable kerosene and diesel containers for consumer use. Considers such standards to be a consumer product safety rule issued by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Requires ASTM International to notify CPSC of any proposed revision to applicable standards. Requires the proposed revision to be incorporated in the consumer product safety rule unless CPSC notifies ASTM International that such revision does not carry out the purposes of this Act."
