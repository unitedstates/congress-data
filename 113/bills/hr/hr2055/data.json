Directs the Secretaries to: (1) widely advertise the prize competitions and announce each one in the Federal Register, and (2) create a joint panel to establish criteria for the program's development. Requires the prize recipient to be awarded a contract with DOD and VA to provide the program, including maintenance and support, and to be compensated at $25 million per year for five years. Reverts to the federal government, after such period, any intellectual property developed under the contract. Authorizes the Secretaries to require competition participants to waive claims against the federal government (except for willful conduct) arising from such participation, and requires participants to obtain liability insurance therefor."
