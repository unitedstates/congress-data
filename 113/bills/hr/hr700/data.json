Directs the Secretary to award grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, or cash prizes to, or enter into other transactions with, public or private entities in pursuit of these objectives. Directs the Secretary to: (1) convene an advisory panel to provide the Secretary and the ARPA-ED with advice in making those awards or entering into those transactions; (2) obtain independent, periodic, and rigorous evaluations of the ARPA-ED's effectiveness; and (3) disseminate information to education practitioners on effective practices and technologies developed through the ARPA-ED."
