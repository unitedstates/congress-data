    "text": "Multimodal Opportunities Via Enhanced Freight Act of 2013 or MOVE Freight Act of 2013 - Defines the \"national freight network\" as a network composed of highways, railways, navigable waterways, seaports, airports, freight intermodal connectors, and aerotropolis transportation systems most critical to the multimodal movement of freight. Revises requirements for establishment and designation of a national freight network. Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to establish a national freight network for efficient movement of freight on highways (as currently), railways, and navigable waterways, as well as into and out of inland ports, seaports, and airports. Recharacterizes the primary freight network as multimodal, including critical rail corridors, critical intermodal connections, and critical inland port, seaport, and airport infrastructure. Directs the Secretary to require (currently, encourage) states to develop state freight plans for immediate and long-range planning activities and investments with respect to freight. Requires states to coordinate with neighboring states to ensure multistate network continuity and connectivity. Directs the Secretary to establish a competitive grant program for capital investment projects that improve the efficiency of the national transportation system to move freight. Limits the federal share of project net capital costs to 80%. Requires a grant recipient to submit to the Secretary: (1) a project management plan and an annual financial plan for a project with a total cost of $500 million or more, or (2) an annual financial plan for a project with a total cost of $100 million or more."
