Directs the Secretary to establish the Task Force to Rescue Immigrant Victims of American Sex Offenders. Authorizes the Secretary to adjust the status of aliens who would otherwise be inadmissible (due to unlawful presence, document fraud, or other specified grounds of inadmissibility) if such aliens have been in the United States for at least five years and meet other requirements.

Establishes a reward program to assist in eliminating immigration-related commercial document fraud operations. Sets forth unfair immigration-related employment practices.
