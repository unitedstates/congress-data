Requires the Office Director: (1) in collaboration with the Secretary of Education, to establish an interagency task force to develop a set of advisory school safety guidelines; and (2) to consider such guidelines in determining permissible uses of school security grant funds. Requires a grant application to be accompanied by a report that is signed by the heads of each law enforcement agency and school district with jurisdiction over the schools where the safety improvements will be implemented and that demonstrates that each proposed use of the grant funds will be: (1) an effective means for improving school safety, (2) consistent with a comprehensive approach to preventing school violence, and (3) individualized to the needs of each school. Authorizes appropriations for such grant program for FY2014-FY2023."
