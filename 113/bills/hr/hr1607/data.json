Provides FY2012-FY2018 compensation for losses to eligible livestock producers for livestock grazing losses due to specified drought or fire circumstances. Excludes from coverage grazing losses on conservation reserve program land used for haying or grazing. Provides FY2012-FY2018 emergency relief to eligible producers of livestock, honeybees, and farm-raised fish to reduce losses due to disease, adverse weather, or other conditions, such as blizzards and wildfires."
