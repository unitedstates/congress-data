Grants authority to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to consolidate federal agencies to eliminate waste and duplication in government programs. Prohibits any federal department or agency from entering into a contract with, awarding a grant to, or guaranteeing a loan for a private entity in excess of $100 million for a fiscal year without congressional approval. Amends the Clean Air Act to prohibit the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from awarding any grant, contract, cooperative agreement, or other financial assistance for any program, project, or activity for the prevention and control of air pollution to occur outside the United States and its territories and possessions. Requires the Director of OMB to determine the amount obligated by each executive agency to purchase and lease civilian vehicles in FY2010. . Prohibits such agency from obligating more than 80% of such amount for the purchase or lease of civilian vehicles in each of FY2013-FY2017. Reduces the rate of basic pay for each Member of Congress by 5%, rounded to the nearest multiple of $100, in lieu of any adjustment which might otherwise take effect in pay periods beginning after the regularly scheduled general election for federal office in November 2014."
