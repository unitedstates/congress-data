Prohibits the Secretary also from authorizing, approving, modifying, or extending any experimental, pilot, or demonstration project under the Social Security Act (SSA) that: (1) waives compliance with mandatory work requirements of SSA title IV part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF), or (2) authorizes an expenditure not otherwise allowable under a state TANF program with respect to compliance with such work requirements. Rescinds and nullifies any waiver relating to the subject matter of the Information Memorandum granted before the enactment of this Act. Extends through December 31, 2013, in the manner authorized for FY2012, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Program under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (except for the Contingency Fund for State Welfare Programs), including the entitlement of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa to matching TANF grants.
