Requires the Secretary to prepare a general management plan for the Park. Dedicates the Park to former U.S. Senator John H.

Requires a memorial to be displayed at a location in the Park that recognizes Senator Chafee's role in the preservation of the resources of the Blackstone River Valley for the people of the United States. Adjusts the boundary of the John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor.
