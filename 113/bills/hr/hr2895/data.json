Amends the federal criminal code to provide that a prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of more than one year, other than a term of life imprisonment, shall receive credit in addition to the time actually served at a rate of 84 days per year of sentence imposed if the Bureau of Prisons determines that the prisoner has displayed exemplary compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations. Prohibits the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) from implementing the Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques (SPOT) program. Requires any unobligated funds for that program to be expeditiously returned to the U.S. Treasury."
