Amends part C (Innovation for Teacher Quality) of title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to repeal We the People, a Civic Education program, and replace it with a program awarding competitive grants to nonprofit educational organizations to develop and implement programs that promote civic learning and engagement through instruction, professional development, and evaluations. Requires such programs to promote: (1) equity through access to funding and program benefits; (2) innovation through design, settings, and delivery; (3) scalability through broad, cost-effective implementation and institutionalization; and (4) accountability through program assessments and the identification of best practices."
