    "text": "Stanislaus River Native Anadromous Fish Improvement Act - Directs the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, the Oakdale Irrigation District, and the South San Joaquin Irrigation District to jointly develop and conduct a pilot non-native predator fish removal program to remove non-native striped bass, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, black bass, and other non-native predator fish from the Stanislaus River. Requires the program to: (1) be scientifically based; (2) include methods to quantify the number and size of predator fish removed each year, the impact of such removal on the overall abundance of predator fish, and the impact of such removal on the populations of certain juvenile anadromous fish found in the Stanislaus River; and (3) be implemented for five consecutive years. Requires such Districts to be responsible for the cost of such program. Directs the Commissioner to post a monthly summary of the raw data on the Bureau website. Requires the Commissioner and districts, following the completion of the program, to publish a peer reviewed report that discusses findings and makes recommendations for further study and action. Voids and preempts any California legal restriction imposed on the catch, take, or harvest of any non-native or introduced aquatic or terrestrial species that preys upon specified stocks of anadromous fish and that occupies or is found in the Stanislaus River. Defines \"anadromous fish\" as native stocks of salmon (including steelhead) that, as of October 30, 1992, were present in and had not been extirpated from the Stanislaus River and that ascend such river to reproduce after maturing in San Francisco Bay or the Pacific Ocean. Excludes any stock, strain, or member of American shad, sockeye salmon, or striped bass. Prohibits a definition of \"anadromous fish\" provided in the Central Valley Project Improvement Act from applying to the operation of New Melones Dam and Reservoir or to any federal action in the Stanislaus River. Requires this Act and the authorities provided under this Act to expire seven years after implementation of the pilot program begins."
