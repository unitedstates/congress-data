Limits the service of an acting CFO to 210 days after the vacancy occurs. Prohibits an individual from serving as acting CFO if he or she did not serve as the District of Columbia Treasurer or as a Deputy CFO for at least 90 days during the one-year period immediately preceding the occurrence of the vacancy."
