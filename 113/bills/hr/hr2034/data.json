Instructs the Secretaries to work with stakeholders to identify problems that can be solved over a period of five years through the development of an advanced composite material. Requires such Centers, by working with the private sector, to strive to produce new composite materials, including related manufacturing processes or applications, that: (1) are lighter, stronger, and more durable than existing materials; (2) have lower life-cycle costs or lower overall environmental impacts; and (3) have an immediate practical application."
