Requires: (1) such report to describe only federal restoration activities that have funding amounts of at least $100,000 and state restoration activities that have funding amounts of at least $50,000; and (2) the Director to submit the report no later than 30 days after the submission of the President's annual budget to Congress. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop and update biennially an adaptive management plan for restoration activities in the Chesapeake Bay watershed that includes: (1) a definition of specific and measurable objectives to improve water quality, habitat, and fisheries; (2) a process for stakeholder participation; (3) monitoring, modeling, experimentation, and other research and evaluation practices; (4) a process for modification of restoration activities that have not attained or will not attain such objectives; and (5) a process for prioritizing restoration activities and programs to which adaptive management shall be applied. Requires the Administrator to: (1) report annually to Congress on implementation of such plan, and (2) include such plan in the Annual Action Plan and Annual Progress Report. Requires an Independent Evaluator for the Chesapeake Bay watershed, who shall review and report to Congress biennially on restoration activities and the use of adaptive management in such activities.
