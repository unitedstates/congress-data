Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to prohibit granting a new right-of-way for a natural gas pipeline unless the right-of-way applicant certifies that all natural gas transported via such pipeline will be offered for sale only in the United States. Declares this Act without force or effect 10 years after enactment of this Act. Instructs the Secretary of the Interior and the Comptroller General to report separately to Congress on the impact of this Act upon: (1) natural gas production on federal lands, (2) consumption of natural gas in the United States, and (3) prices and markets for natural gas in the United States."
