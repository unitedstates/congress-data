Requires such guidance to: designate the single federal agency responsible for coordinating the government's efforts in response to a nuclear disaster (coordinating agency), including making a formal declaration that a nuclear disaster exists; identify the circumstances under which such declaration will occur; designate the single agency responsible for recommending the evacuation of the area within a 10-mile to 50-mile radius from the nuclear power plant; identify the circumstances under which such recommendation will be made; designate the single agency responsible for developing plans for, educating the public regarding, and conducting, such evacuation; designate the single agency responsible for recommending that evacuees may return following a nuclear disaster; identify the circumstances under which such recommendation will be made; designate the single agency responsible for conducting cleanup of a nuclear disaster; and identify what cleanup standards will apply."
