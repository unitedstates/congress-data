Expresses the sense of Congress that, at the direction of the Capitol Police Board or the fire marshal, the taking of guests or visitors into such areas by Members or their authorized employees should be temporarily suspended or otherwise subject to restriction for safety or security reasons to the same extent as guided tours of the Capitol led by the AOC or the Capitol Guide Service. Expresses the sense of Congress that nothing in this resolution shall be: (1) construed to affect such authority relating to the movement of such employees through the Capitol; or (2) interpreted to contradict the congressional staff-led tour policy that ensures that tours of the Capitol are conducted by staff members who have undergone mandatory life safety and historical accuracy training."
