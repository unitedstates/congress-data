Rejects any suggestion that P.L. 107-40 (the authorization of force resolution approved in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001) or P.L. 107-243 (the authorization of force resolution approved by Congress to go to war with Iraq) extends to authorizing military action against Iran, including over its nuclear program."
