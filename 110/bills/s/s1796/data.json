Requires the Township, as condition of the transfer of possession, to install the Lens in the Lighthouse as a Class I private aid to navigation. Instructs the Commandant, upon certification of the Commandant that the Township has installed the Lens and is able to operate the Lens and Lighthouse as a private aid to navigation, to convey to the Township all interest of the United States in and to the Lens. Allows the Commandant, if the Commandant conveys the Lens to the Township, to convey to the Township any personal property previously transferred to the Township under this Act."
