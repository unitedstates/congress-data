Requires the Secretary to develop model training and caseload standards for child guardians in child abuse and neglect cases. Mynisha's Law - Authorizes any local or tribal government to apply to the Attorney General for designation as a high intensity interstate gang area. Requires the Attorney General to: (1) establish criteria for reviewing such applications; and (2) establish an Interagency Gang Prevention Task Force to coordinate federal assistance to such high intensity interstate gang areas.Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to allow the use of school security grants for: (1) the placement of surveillance equipment in schools; (2) the establishment of hotlines or tiplines for reporting potentially dangerous students and situations; and (3) capital improvements to make school facilities more secure."
