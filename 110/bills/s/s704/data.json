Prohibits construing these provisions to authorize or prohibit any investigative, protective, or intelligence activities performed in connection with official duties and in accordance with all applicable laws, by a law enforcement agency of the United States, a state or its political subdivision, or a U.S. intelligence agency. Provides civil and criminal penalties for violations. Allows enforcement by states, granting the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) the right to intervene."
