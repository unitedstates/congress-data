Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a pilot program to expand the visa waiver program for up to five new countries that are are cooperating with the United States on security and counterterrorism matters. Requires a country, prior to participation, to conclude a counterterrorism and security information sharing agreement with the United States. Authorizes: (1) a country to participate for an initial three-year period, with an additional two-year extension; and (2) the Secretary to terminate a country's participation for program noncompliance. Directs the Secretary to develop and implement procedures to improve the manner of calculating visa overstay rates."
