    "text": "Protecting Children in the 21st Century Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to issue regulations requiring video services to prevent child pornography. Amends the Crime Control Act of 1990 to triple the fines on providers of electronic communication services or remote computing services who knowingly and willfully fail to report child pornography. Requires warning labels for websites depicting sexually explicit material. Deleting Online Predators Act of 2007 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require schools and libraries that receive universal service support to enforce a policy that: (1) prohibits access to a commercial social networking website or chat room unless used for an educational purpose with adult supervision; and (2) protects against access to visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors. Directs the FCC to issue a consumer alert regarding use of the Internet by child predators and establish a website resource. Children's Listbroker Privacy Act - Makes it unlawful: (1) to sell personal information about an individual the seller knows to be a child (under age 16); (2) to purchase personal information about an individual identified by the seller as a child for the purpose of marketing to that child; or (3) for a purchaser who has provided a certification limiting the use of such information to engage in any practice that violates the certification terms."
