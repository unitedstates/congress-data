Instructs the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior to prepare jointly programmatic environmental impact statements regarding the impacts of the deployment of marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies in U.S. navigable waters. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow: (1) a tax credit for electricity produced from marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy; and (2) an investment credit and five-year depreciation for equipment which produces electricity from marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy. Denies a tax credit for producing fuel from a nonconventional source (dual benefit) with respect to a marine and hydrokinetic facility for which an investment credit under this Act is claimed by the taxpayer."
