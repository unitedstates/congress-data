Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to provide, upon an eligible individual's request, his or her taxpayer account statement. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to include the financial outlays exceeding $25,000 of all federal agencies for fiscal years after FY2008 on the Internet website established by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006. Declares that nothing in this Act shall require the disclosure of classified information."
