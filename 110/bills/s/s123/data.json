Requires the Secretary to credit toward the non-federal share of the cost of the project elements the cost of design and construction work carried out by the non-federal interest before the date of the partnership agreement for the project elements if the work is integral to the project elements. Makes the operation, maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, and replacement of the Houma Navigation Canal lock complex and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway floodgate features of the project that provide for inland waterway transportation a federal responsibility."
