Requires he NTIA to develop a common content description tag that: (1) will warn and inform consumers regarding the presence of material that is harmful to minors; (2) will allow consumers to block or filter website access; and (3) is technologically capable of being embedded in the website's source code. Requires a website operator, when registering or re-registering a website, to provide to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers certain information, including the content description tag."
