Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) to reconvene the negotiated rulemaking committee established pursuant to the 9/11 Commission Implementation Act of 2004, with the addition of any new interested parties, to: (1) review proposed regulations to implement the minimum document requirements, and the provisions, of the REAL ID Act of 2005; and (2) submit recommendations to the Secretary regarding appropriate modifications to such regulations and such Act."
