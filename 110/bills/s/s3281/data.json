    "text": "Drive America on Natural Gas Act of 2008 - Amends the Clean Air Act to: (1) redefine renewable fuel to include renewable and nonrenewable natural gas (NG), including compressed natural (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG); and (2) require fuel credit program regulations to provide for generation of credits for renewable and nonrenewable natural gas. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a new qualified alternative fuel motor vehicle credit for dual fueled automobiles. Directs the Secretary of Energy, in coordination with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to conduct a program of natural gas vehicle research, development, and demonstration, with a particular emphasis on streamlining the certification of NG conversion systems. Directs the EPA Administrator to: (1) establish a demonstration program to assist states in facilitating the development of alternative-fueled vehicles; and (2) waive requirements for recertification of certain kits for the conversion of vehicles to NG."
