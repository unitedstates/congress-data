    "text": "Cellulosic Ethanol Incentive Act of 2007 - Amends the Clean Air Act to: (1) increase the volume of renewable fuel required to be in gasoline for 2012; (2) prescribe such volumes applicable for 2013 through 2030; (3) apply existing requirements (with a revised ratio) for determining volumes for years not specified to calendar year 2031 and thereafter; (4) prescribe increasing minimum quantities of renewable fuel that must be derived from cellolosic biomass for 2010 through 2030; and (5) apply, for 2010 and thereafter, the 2.5-to-1 ratio of cellulosic biomass ethanol or waste derived ethanol to renewable fuel only to the quantity of cellulosic biomass ethanol sold that is in excess of the minimum quantity of renewable fuel derived from cellulosic biomass required for that year. Requires not less than 30% of the total volume of renewable fuel required in a state under this Act to be derived from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) region in which the state is located. Allows the Administrator of the EPA to reduce or waive such requirement if it would be impracticable for the region to produce the required volume of renewable fuel."
