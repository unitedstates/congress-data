Directs the Secretary of Energy to use amounts in the Trust Fund to: (1) provide assistance to farmers, producers, biorefiners, researchers, universities, and other persons or entities involved in the research, development, and deployment, or production of biofuels, especially for cellulosic ethanol production; or (2) advance research, development, and deployment of biofuels, especially cellulosic ethanol produced from biomass feedstocks."
