Requires funds approved by the Commission for a project in an Appalachian state pursuant to a congressional directive to be derived from the amount allocated to that state.Extends the termination date of the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 until October 1, 2012.Adds to the Appalachian region the counties of: (1) Metcalfe, Nicholas, and Robertson in Kentucky; (2) Ashtabula, Mahoning, and Trumbull in Ohio; (3) Lawrence and Lewis in Tennessee; and (4) Henry and Patrick in Virginia."
