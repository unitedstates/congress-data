Instructs the Secretary to promulgate diligent development regulations that: (1) include benchmarks for oil and gas development to ensure that leaseholders produce oil and gas from each lease within the original term of the lease; and (2) require each leaseholder to submit a diligent development plan showing how the lessee will meet the benchmarks. Establishes a civil penalty for noncompliance with this Act."
