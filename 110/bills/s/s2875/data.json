Requires the Secretaries to establish criteria and requirements to implement the demonstration program and when promulgating regulations for the implementation of such program, to consult with states that have implemented state programs that provide assistance to livestock producers. Sets forth requirements states and Indian tribes shall meet to be eligible to receive a grant. Prescribes criteria for the allocation of funding. Limits the federal share of the cost of any activity provided assistance under this Act to half of the total cost of that activity. Authorizes appropriations."
