Exempts buildings if the agency head with jurisdiction determines that compliance would be impracticable based on: (1) the quantity of energy required by each activity carried out in the building; and (2) whether the building is used to carry out activities relating to national security. Requires: (1) federal agencies to report to the Secretary of Energy on such determinations; and (2) the Secretary to review such report and notify agency heads on whether any federal building described in the report shall be required to comply.Requires the Secretary to submit to Congress the results of a study comparing: (1) the expected energy savings resulting from the implementation of this Act; and (2) energy savings under all other federal energy savings requirements. Requires the sponsor of any development or redevelopment project involving property with a footprint exceeding 5,000 square feet and that is federally owned or federally financed to use site planning, design, construction, and maintenance strategies to maintain predevelopment hydrology with regard to the temperature, rate, volume, and duration of flow."
