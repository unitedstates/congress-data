Reauthorizes appropriations for sewer overflow control grants through FY2012.Modifies grant funding allocation provisions to reflect new dates of authorization and reauthorized amounts. Establishes a December 31, 2010, deadline for the report to Congress of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on recommended funding levels for sewer overflow control grants."
