Entitles each party under arbitration to: (1) a competent, neutral arbitrator and independent, neutral administration of the dispute; (2) representation by an attorney or other representative at such party's expense; (3) a fair arbitration hearing; (4) a face-to-face hearing; (5) the right to present evidence and cross examine witnesses; (6) a written explanation of the basis for the arbitrator's decision; and (7) the right to opt out of binding arbitration and into the small claims court (for claims of $50,000 or less). Prescribes procedures for complaints by any party of denial of rights by the other party or the arbitrator."
