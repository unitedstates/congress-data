    "text": "International Clean Energy Technologies Deployment and Global Energy Markets Investment Act of 2007 - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to set forth a program for clean energy assistance to developing countries. Instructs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) establish a pilot program of financial assistance for clean energy projects in developing countries that will result in reduced greenhouse gas emissions; and (2) make a loan or loan guarantee for not more than 50% of project costs for each pilot program participant. Includes in such pilot program projects for clean energy technologies, including clean coal, small or advanced nuclear, small or advanced hydropower, biofuels, renewable, and energy efficiency technologies. Directs the President to establish a Task Force on International Clean Energy Technologies Cooperation. Requires the Task Force to establish an Interagency Working Group on Clean Energy Technology Exports. Requires such Task Force to identify developing countries that represent the predominant share of energy use, and to submit to the President a strategy that includes: (1) adoption and deployment of clean energy technologies and strategies in developing countries; (2) expansion of clean energy technology markets and facilitation of clean energy technology exports to developing countries; (3) integration into U.S. foreign policy objectives of the promotion of clean energy technology deployment and reduced greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries, and clean energy technology exports; (4) a pilot program of financial assistance for qualifying projects; and (5) development of financial mechanisms and instruments that are cost-effective and facilitate private capital investment in such technologies."
