Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to establish and maintain a public website that serves as a central point of information and access for federal grant applicants, including grant: (1) announcements; (2) statements of eligibility; (3) application requirements; (4) purposes; (5) federal agency providers; and (6) deadlines for applying and awarding. Requires the website to allow grant applicants to apply for grants on it, among other uses. Amends the Act to require OMB to report to Congress on: (1) the implementation of FFAMIA; and (2) a strategic plan specifying federal financial assistance progams suitable for common applications and reporting forms or requirements, changes in law (if any) needed to achieve the goals of this Act, and plans, timeliness, and cost estimates for developing an entirely electronic, web-based process for managing federal financial assistance. Requires the head of each federal agency that has not been exempted from FFAMIA to develop a plan that describes how it will carry out its responsibilities under the strategic plan."
