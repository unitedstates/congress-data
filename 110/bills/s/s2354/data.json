Prohibits the use of the conveyed land for residential or commercial purposes, except for the limited agricultural exemption described above. Authorizes the Secretary to require additional terms and conditions as considered appropriate to protect U.S. interests. Requires, if, the conveyed land is no longer used in accordance with this Act: (1) such land shall revert to the United States, at the discretion of the Secretary; and (2) if the Secretary chooses to have such land revert, and if it is environmentally contaminated, the city or any other person responsible for the contamination to remediate such contamination. Requires the city to pay all survey and other administrative costs."
