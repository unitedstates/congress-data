    "text": "Caring for Wounded Warriors Act of 2008 - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out up to three pilot programs to assess the feasibility and advisability of providing training and certification for family caregivers of veterans and members of the Armed Forces with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Requires each pilot program to be carried out in a medical facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Requires the Secretary to develop curricula for the training of such caregivers as personal care attendants. Makes a family caregiver who receives certification as a personal care attendant eligible for compensation from the VA for the care provided. Directs the Secretary to carry out a pilot program to assess the feasibility and advisability of providing respite care to members and veterans who have been diagnosed with TBI through students enrolled in graduate programs in mental health or rehabilitation-related fields. Requires such students to provide: (1) relief to the family caregivers; and (2) socialization and cognitive skill development to the members and veterans. Allows such students to receive coursework credit for such participation."
