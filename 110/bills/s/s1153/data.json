Requires the SEC to publish the small business compliance guide (as required under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996) on the same date as the publication of the final rule issued to carry out a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act concerning management of internal controls for financial reporting.
