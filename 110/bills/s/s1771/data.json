Provides for enforcement under the Consumer Product Safety Act. (Sec. 5) Establishes a program of grants to states to: (1) hire and train enforcement personnel; and (2) educate pool construction, installation, and service companies, pool owners and operators, and other members of the public. Conditions grants on a state imposing certain requirements by statute, including: (1) enclosure of residential pools and spas to prevent small children from gaining unsupervised access; and (2) drain entrapment prevention devices and systems on all pools and spas. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 6) Specifies minimum state law requirements. (Sec. 7) Requires the CPSC to establish and carry out a public education program on methods to prevent drowning and entrapment in pools and spas. (Sec. 8) Requires a CPSC report."
