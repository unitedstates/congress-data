Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to deposit 45% of all rentals, royalties, bonus bids, and other sums due and payable to the United States from leases for new producing areas (qualified revenues) in the outer Continental Shelf into the general fund of the Treasury. Requires 55% of qualified revenues to be deposited into a special account in the Treasury, from which the Secretary shall disburse: (1) 37.5% to eligible producing states for new producing areas; (2) 12.5% to provide assistance to states in accordance with the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965; and (3) 5% to states for historic offshore production distribution."
