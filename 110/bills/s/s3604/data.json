    "text": "Economic Recovery Act, 2008 - Makes emergency supplemental appropriations for FY2008 for infrastructure, energy, and economic recovery to: (1) the Department of Agriculture; (2) the Department of Commerce; (3) the Department of Justice (DOJ); (4) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); (5) the Legal Services Corporation; (6) the Department of Defense (DOD) - Civil Corps of Engineers; (7) the Department of the Interior; (8) the Department of Energy (DOE); (9) the Department of the Treasury, including the Office of Inspector General; (10) the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC); (11) the General Services Administration (GSA); (12) the Small Business Administration (SBA); (13) the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); (14) the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); (15) the Department of Labor (DOL); (16) the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); (17) the Department of Education; (18) the legislative branch; (19) the Department of Transportation (DOT); and (20) the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Makes supplemental appropriations for FY2008 to provide a temporary increase in benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Makes supplemental appropriations for FY2008 to provide a temporary: (1) increase in the Medicaid federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) under the Social Security Act; and (2) reinstatement of authority to provide federal matching payments for state spending of child support incentive payments. Makes supplemental appropriations for FY2008 to extend the period of emergency unemployment compensation (EUC). Exempts weeks of unemployment between enactment of this Act and December 8, 2009, from the prohibition in the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 against federal matching payments to a state for the first week in an individual's eligibility period for which extended compensation or sharable regular compensation is paid if the state law of such state provides for payment (at any time or under any circumstances) of regular compensation to an individual for his or her first week of otherwise compensable unemployment. (Thus allows temporary federal matching for the first week of extended benefits for states with no waiting period.) National Park Centennial Fund Act - Establishes in the Treasury the National Park Centennial Fund. Designates each amount in the Economic Recovery Act, 2008 as: (1) an emergency requirement and necessary to meet emergency needs; and (2) a supplemental appropriation for FY2008, or, if enacted after FY2008, for FY2009."
