Establishes an Air Transportation System Advisory Board. Authorizes the Secretary to establish the Realignment and Consolidation of Aviation Facilities and Services Commission to provide recommendations for consolidation of FAA services and facilities. Sets forth requirements authorizing the Administrator to access criminal history records or data bases systems with regard to FAA employees. Directs the Secretary to establish a program to evaluate market-based pricing mechanisms for domestic flights which may be adopted at congested airports. Directs the Secretary to carry out an environmental mitigation demonstration pilot program to reduce the impact of aircraft in the vicinity of airports. Extends the Secretary's authority to provide insurance and reinsurance against loss or damage arising out of any risk from the operation of a domestic or foreign aircraft.
