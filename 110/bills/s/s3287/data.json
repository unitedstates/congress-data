Includes within such APR all charges payable directly or indirectly incident to, ancillary to, or as a condition of the extension of credit. States that any payment in violation of this Act is null, void, and unenforceable. Prescribes civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Empowers states' Attorneys General to enforce it."
