    "text": "Higher Education Amendments of 2007 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to revise HEA programs and to extend the authorization of appropriations for them through FY2013. Title I: General Provisions - (Sec. 101) Adds definitions of a critical foreign language, distance education, and poverty line. Provides that critical foreign languages are those contained on the list designated by the Secretary of Education in the Federal Register on August 5, 1985, but allows the Secretary to set language priorities according to the purposes of a specific program and national security, economic competitiveness, and educational needs. States that poverty line refers to the poverty line applicable to a family of the size involved. (Sec. 102) Revises the general definition of institution of higher education (IHE) to include schools that: (1) award degrees (not necessarily a bachelor's degree) that are acceptable for admission to a graduate or professional degree program; and (2) public or nonprofit private schools that enroll students who will be dually or concurrently enrolled in a secondary school. (Sec. 103) Revises the definition of IHE for purposes of title IV student assistance programs. Requires graduate medical schools located outside the country, that qualified as IHEs owing to their having a state-approved clinical training program, to have continuously operated a clinical training program in at least one state that is approved by such state. Includes as proprietary IHEs and as postsecondary vocational institutions any schools that enroll students who will be dually or concurrently enrolled in a secondary school. (Sec. 104) Elaborates on the current sense of Congress regarding the speech and association rights of students in higher education to specify that such students should not be intimidated, harassed, discouraged from speaking out, or discriminated against. (Sec. 105) Replaces the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity with an Institutional Quality and Integrity Committee to assess the process of accreditation and the eligibility and certification of such institutions for title IV student assistance programs. Sets September 30, 2012, as the Committee's termination date. (Sec. 106) Requires IHEs' biennial reviews of their alcohol and drug abuse prevention programs to include a determination as to: (1) the number of drug and alcohol-related incidents and fatalities occurring on their property or as part of their activities that are reported to them; and (2) the number and type of sanctions the IHEs impose on students or employees as a result of such incidents or fatalities. (Sec. 107) Extends an authorization of appropriations to continue coverage of prior rights and obligations for servicing outstanding bonds from certain earlier programs under HEA title VII before it was amended by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 and the Higher Education Amendments of 1998.
