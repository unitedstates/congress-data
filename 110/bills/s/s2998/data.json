    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "Prepaid Calling Card Consumer Protection Act of 2008 - Requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to require every prepaid telephone calling service provider and prepaid telephone calling card distributor to disclose certain information, including: (1) the number of calling units or minutes of domestic interstate calls provided or the dollar value and the domestic interstate rate per minute; (2) the calling unit or per minute rates for all served international preferred destinations; (3) the applicable per minute rates for all served international destinations; (4) all terms and conditions, including regarding fees, policies on refunds, recharges, decrements, and expiration, and time imitations; and (5) a toll-free customer service number and hours. Makes it unlawful to: (1) deduct anything but the per minute rate and disclosed fees; (2) provide fewer minutes or charge a higher per minute rate than promoted or advertised; (3) provide fewer minutes than the number of minutes announced, promoted, or advertised through any voice prompt; (4) have (unless clearly disclosed) an expiration date less than one year after first use (or after additional minutes are purchased); and (5) charge a fee for an unconnected call. Prohibits evading liability by using disclaimers or limitations. Treats violations as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or deceptive act or practice under specified provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Allows state civil enforcement and state laws offering equal or greater protection to consumers."
