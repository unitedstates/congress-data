    "text": "Clean, Reliable, Efficient and Secure Energy Act of 2007 - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to establish the Appliance Efficiency Standards Commission.Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to: (1) require an electric utility to demonstrate that alternative investments in advanced grid technologies have been considered before undertaking investments in nonadvanced grid technologies; and (2) prescribe a Clean Energy Portfolio Standard, including a credit program. Establishes the Clean Energy Technology Trust Fund.Transfers to the Secretary of Energy (Secretary) specified lands for use for high-level radioactive waste disposal and spent nuclear fuel. Amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to require the Secretary to apply to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a license to construct and operate facilities to receive and store spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste at the Yucca Mountain (Nevada) site.Instructs the Secretary to construct the FutureGen Facility to demonstrate integrating commercial-scale gasification combined cycle power plant technologies with advanced clean coal energy technologies.Directs the Secretary of Transportation to: (1) prescribe average fuel economy standards for automobiles; and (2) implement a traffic signal coordination program.Amends the Clean Air Act to instruct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate regulations to ensure that diesel fuel contains a certain volume of biodiesel fuel.Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to: (1) authorize appropriations for coal-to-liquid and gas-to-liquid projects; (2) establish the Appliance Efficiency Standards Commission [sic]; and (3) revise requirements for the national greenhouse gas emissions registry. Requires the total amount of fuel utilized by the Department of Defense in a calendar year to be coal-to-liquid fuel, gas-to-liquid fuel, or both. Amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to revise requirements about the availability of certain areas of the Outer Continental Shelf for leasing. Prescribes requirements governing energy efficiency in federal buildings and public schools.Instructs the Secretary of Interior to develop a methodology for conducting a national assessment of the geological storage capacity for carbon dioxide. Establishes the Regulatory Reform for Carbon Sequestration Commission.Requires studies and reports to Congress on: (1) replacement of residential HVCAR equipment that does not meet minimum efficiency requirements; (2) fuel economy standards for heavy trucks; (3) synthetic fuel in commercial aircraft; (4) infrastructure needs for renewable fuels; and (5) strategic natural gas reserve.Directs the Secretary to implement an education program to increase public awareness of measures that consumers can take to increase energy efficiency.Reestablishes the Office of Technology Assessment in the legislative branch."
