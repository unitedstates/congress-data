Requires the FCC, in designing the program, to consider certain factors, including: (1) taking into account market-by-market needs; (2) avoiding digital signal interference; and (3) already-adopted transition and coordination plans. Prohibits: (1) analog broadcasting on any spectrum that is approved or pending approval for public safety radio services; and (2) including the analog spectrum between channels 52 and 69 reclaimed from analog television broadcasting."
