    "text": "Prehistoric Trackways National Monument Establishment Act - Establishes the Prehistoric Trackways National Monument in New Mexico in order to conserve, protect, and enhance the unique and nationally important paleontological, scientific, educational, scenic, and recreational resources and values of specified public land in Dona Ana County, New Mexico. Allows the Secretary of the Interior, if additional paleontological resources are discovered on public land adjacent to the Monument, to make minor boundary adjustments to the Monument to include the resources in the Monument. Requires the Secretary to manage the Monument: (1) in a manner that conserves, protects, and enhances the resources and values of the Monument; and (2) in accordance with this Act, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, and other applicable laws. Requires that the Monument be managed as a component of the National Landscape Conservation System. Directs the Secretary to develop a comprehensive management plan for the long-term protection and management of the Monument: (1) which shall describe the appropriate uses and management of the Monument and shall allow for continued scientific research at the Monument during the development of the plan; and (2) which may incorporate any appropriate decisions contained in any current management or activity plan for the land for the Monument and use information developed in studies of any land within or adjacent to the Monument that were conducted before the enactment of this Act. Instructs the Secretary to only allow uses of the Monument that would further the purposes for which it has been established. Requires the Secretary to provide for public interpretation of, and education and scientific research on, the paleontological resources of the Monument, with priority given to exhibiting and curating the resources in Dona Ana County. Allows the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with appropriate public entities to carry out such activities. Prohibits the establishment of the Monument from changing the management status of any area within the boundary of the Monument that is: (1) designated as a wilderness study area and managed in accordance with provisions regarding the status of lands during the period of review and determination for designation as wilderness under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976; or (2) managed as an area of critical environmental concern. Provides that, if there is a conflict between the laws applicable to such areas and this Act, the more restrictive provision shall control. Permits the use of motorized vehicles in the Monument only on roads and trails designated for use by such vehicles under the management plan, except as needed for administrative purposes or to respond to an emergency. Allows the Secretary to issue permits for special recreation events involving motorized vehicles within the Monument's boundaries, including the \"Chile Challenge:\" (1) to the extent the events do not harm paleontological resources; and (2) subject to any terms and conditions that the Secretary determines to be necessary. Withdraws any federal land within the Monument and any land or interest in land that is acquired by the United States for inclusion in the Monument from: (1) entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; (2) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and (3) operation of the mineral leasing laws, geothermal leasing laws, and minerals materials laws. Permits grazing to continue in any area of the Monument in which grazing is currently allowed, subject to applicable laws (including regulations). Prohibits anything in this Act from constituting an express or implied reservation by the United States of any water or water rights with respect to the Monument. Authorizes appropriations."
