Directs the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide the Commission specified funding and support services. Terminates budget authority to implement food and food safety provisions of the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Egg Products Inspection Act, and chapters I through IV of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act two years after enactment of this Act."
