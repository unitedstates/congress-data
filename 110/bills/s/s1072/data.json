Establishes within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a Federal Environmental Office to advise the Council on agency activities and a presidential leadership award program.Provides for exemption authority.Sets forth requirements for federal agency purchases of a commercially available, off-the-shelf product that uses an external standby power device or that contains an internal standby power function. Requires the Secretary of Energy to maintain a list of products subject to such requirements and a list of products that meet the requirements.Limits public utility contracts for renewable energy to 20 years.Exempts specified project costs for energy-efficient technologies from requirements concerning a project's estimated maximum costs.Requires the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA): (1) to implement a program to use energy-efficient light bulbs in federal buildings to replace low efficiency bulbs as they burn out; and (2) and the Secretary of Energy and the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to work with industry to develop consensus national standards for energy-efficient light bulb disposal and with manufacturers and importers of energy-efficient bulbs to develop standards for labeling bulbs containing mercury or other toxic substances."
