Directs the Secretary to establish a demonstration project which allows the Secretary to waive requirements for awarding breast and cervical cancer grants that require 60% of grant funds to be spent on screening and referrals for medical treatments and no more than 40% to be spent on other activities for not more than five states, if: (1) the state involved will use the waiver to leverage non-federal funds to supplement screening and referral services; (2) the application of such requirements would result in a barrier to the enrollment of women; (3) the state demonstrates how it will use the waiver to expand the level of screening and follow-up services provided; (4) the state submits to the Secretary assurances that it will maintain state fiscal expenditures for such screening and referral services for the waiver period at the level for such expenditures prior to the grant of the waiver; (5) the state involved submits to the Secretary a plan for maintaining the level of activities carried out under the waiver after the expiration of the waiver; (6) the Secretary finds that granting such a waiver to a state will increase the number of women in the state who receive such services, including screening for both breast and cervical cancers; and (7) the Secretary finds that granting such a waiver to a state will not adversely affect the quality of such services. Requires the Secretary to grant such waivers for a period that is not less than one year but not more than two years. Allows the Secretary to extend a waiver, upon request of a state, for one additional period if the Secretary reviews performance under the waiver and determines that the waiver requirements have been and will continue to be met. Requires the Secretary to include as part of the evaluations of the activities carried out pursuant to breast and cervical cancer grants: (1) the total amount of dollars leveraged annually from non-federal entities in states receiving a waiver and how these amounts were used; (2) for states receiving a waiver, the percentages of the grant expended on screening and referral services and on other services or activities; (3) the number of states receiving waivers annually; (4) the number of women receiving screening and referral services in programs before and after the granting of a waiver; (5) the average annual level of state fiscal expenditures for such services for the year preceding the grant of the waiver; and (6) the amount of non-federal contributions by the state according to source and the proportion of non-federal funds to federal funds. Prohibits the use of amounts to which a waiver applies to increase the number of salaried employees. Prohibits the Secretary from granting a waiver or extension under this Act after September 30, 2012. Sets forth reporting requirements. Authorizes appropriations for breast and cervical cancer grants from FY2008-FY2012."
