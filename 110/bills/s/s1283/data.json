    "text": "Wounded Warrior Assistance Act of 2007 - Requires a member of the Armed Forces (member) in an outpatient status at a military medical treatment facility (facility) to be assigned a medical care case manager and a service member advocate, each of whom have completed a training program and curriculum for such management. Directs the Secretary of Defense to establish a: (1) Department of Defense (DOD)-wide Ombudsman Office; (2) toll-free hotline for reporting deficiencies in medical services and medical support facilities; (3) standardized training program and curriculum for military personnel and health care professionals involved in the disability evaluation system; and (4) pilot program to track and assist outpatient members who are still in need of medical treatment. Requires the Secretary of the military department concerned to: (1) notify appropriate Members of Congress of the hospitalization of members evacuated from a theater of combat; and (2) ensure that members appearing before medical evaluation boards have access to an independent medical advocate. Requires reports concerning: (1) enhanced training for individuals providing assistance to recovering members; (2) the adequacy and quality of medical and medical-support facilities at each military installation; and (3) traumatic brain injury classifications. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide a process for the transition of members from the DOD health care and disability systems to those of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA); (2) allow reserve members to use facilities closest to home for the treatment of injuries sustained in a combat theater of operations; (3) develop a plan and conduct research for reducing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in combat veterans; (4) study the provision of support services for families of recovering members; (5) evaluate the Polytrauma Liaison Officer/Non-Commissioned Officer program; (6) study waiting periods for appointments at VA facilities; and (7) study the development of a joint soldier tracking system for recovering members. Establishes the: (1) Department of Defense Medical Support Fund; and (2) Oversight Board for Wounded Warriors."
