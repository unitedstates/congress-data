Revises the definition of \"eligible rural area.\" Establishes a non-duplification of terrestrial lines, facilities, or systems requirement. Requires loan applications to be processed within 180 days. Eliminates the eligibility prohibition for entities that serve more than 2% of the telephone lines installed in the United States. Establishes a grant program for development of statewide initiatives to identify and track the availability and adoption of broadband services within eligible rural areas. Sets forth loan security and equity requirement provisions."
