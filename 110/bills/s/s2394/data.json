Requires the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council to (1) amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to require prospective contractors to be free of any tax debt, to require contracting officers to access the national federal tax lien registry and the federal tax conviction database established by this Act in making a determination of responsibility with respect to any prospective contractor, and to establish as cause for contractor debarment and suspension the making of false statements regarding federal tax information; and (2) make final the proposed rule FAR Case 2006-011 (Representations and Certifications - Tax Delinquency).Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) direct the Secretary of the Treasury to establish and maintain a federal tax lien registry, in lieu of filing tax liens in local jurisdictions, which would be accessible to and searchable by the public through the Internet at no cost; (2) establish the priority of a federal tax lien based upon the date and time of the filing of a notice of lien in the federal tax lien registry; and (3) reduce the period for releasing satisfied or unenforceable tax liens from 30 to 10 days.Requires the Attorney General to establish and maintain a database of individuals and entities with convictions for federal tax offenses."
