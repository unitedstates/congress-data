Directs the Secretary to: (1) determine the format for biometric information, including fingerprints; (2) implement procedures for electronic transmission of biometric information that will safeguard privacy and civil liberties; and (3) provide for centralization of naturalization applications of active duty personnel serving abroad and such applications' expedited processing. (Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary to update the appropriate Internet websites to reflect naturalization law changes. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary should make necessary updates to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) application forms. (Sec. 4) Directs the Secretary to report to the appropriate congressional committees with respect to the adjudication of military service-related naturalization applications. Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study and report to the appropriate congressional committees with respect to implementation of this Act by the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Defense."
