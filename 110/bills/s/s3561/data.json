Limits such credit to the lesser of 33% of such costs or $500.Eliminates for major integrated oil companies: (1) the tax deduction for intangible drilling and development costs in taxable years in which the average price of crude oil is greater than $34.71 per barrel and the average price of natural gas is greater that $4.34 per 1,000 cubic feet; and (2) the tax credit for enhanced oil recovery costs in taxable years in which the average price of crude oil is greater than $34.71 per barrel. Denies such oil companies and certain producers or refiners of crude oil a foreign tax credit for payments to certain foreign countries or U.S. possessions from which they receive a specified economic benefit as a dual capacity taxpayer."
