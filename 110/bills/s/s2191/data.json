    "date": "2008-05-20", 
    "text": "Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act of 2007 - Title I: Capping Greenhouse Gas Emissions - Subtitle A: Tracking Emissions - (Sec. 1101) Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to: (1) establish a federal greenhouse gas (GHG) registry; (2) establish an advisory body that is broadly representative of private enterprise, agriculture, environmental groups, and state, tribal, and local governments to guide the development and management of the Registry; and (3) publish information contained in the Registry on the Internet, except information vital to national security or confidential business information that would cause significant competitive harm (provides that information relating to GHG emissions shall not be considered to be confidential business information.) Defines \"GHG emissions\" to mean emissions of a GHG, including: (1) stationary combustion source emissions from combustion of fuels in stationary equipment; (2) process emissions from chemical or physical processes other than combustion; (3) fugitive emissions from equipment leaks; and (4) biogenic emissions resulting from biological processes, such as anaerobic decomposition, nitrification, and denitrification.Requires each affected facility to submit periodic reports to the Administrator for inclusion in the Registry, including annual and quarterly data on: (1) the quantity and type of fossil fuels that are extracted, produced, refined, imported, exported, or consumed; (2) the quantity of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons, sulfur hexafluoride, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide that has been captured and sequestered and other GHGs generated, produced, imported, exported, or consumed; (3) the quantity of electricity generated, imported, exported, or consumed and the quantity of GHGs emitted when the imported, exported, or consumed electricity was generated; (4) the aggregate quantity of all GHG emissions, including stationary combustion source emissions, process emissions, and fugitive emissions; (5) GHG emissions expressed in metric tons of each GHG emitted and in the quantity of carbon dioxide equivalents of each GHG emitted; (6) sources of GHG emissions; and (7) a certification regarding the accuracy and completeness of reported data.Requires the Administrator to verify the completeness and accuracy of the report before including the information in the Registry. Requires each affected facility to provide information sufficient for the Administrator to: (1) verify that its fossil fuel and GHG emission data have been completely and accurately reported; and (2) ensure the submission or retention, for five-years, of data sources, information on internal control activities, information on assumptions used in reporting emissions and fuels, and uncertainty analyses. Defines \"affected facility\" to mean: (1) a covered facility; (2) another facility that emits a GHG; and (3) at the option of the Administrator, a vehicle fleet with emissions of more than 10,000 carbon dioxide equivalents in any year, assuming no double-counting of emissions. Excludes from such a term any facility that: (1) is not a covered facility; (2) is owned or operated by a small business; and (3) emits fewer than 10,000 carbon dioxide equivalents in any year. Defines \"covered facility\" to mean any facility that: (1) uses more than 5,000 tons of coal in a year; (2) is a natural gas processing plant, produces natural gas in Alaska, or imports natural gas (including liquefied natural gas); (3) produces or imports petroleum- or coal-based liquid or gaseous fuel, the combustion of which will emit a group I GHG, assuming no capture and sequestration of that gas; (4) produces for sale or distribution or imports, in any year, more than 10,000 carbon dioxide equivalents of chemicals that are group I GHG, assuming no capture and destruction or sequestration of that gas; or (5) emits as a byproduct of the production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) more than 10,000 carbon dioxide equivalents of HFCs in any year. Defines \"facility\" to mean: (1) buildings, structures, or installations located on contiguous or adjacent properties of an entity in the United States; and (2) at the option of the Administrator, any activity or operation that emits 10,000 carbon dioxide equivalents in any year and that has a technical connection with the activities carried out at a facility, but that is not conducted or located on the facility's property.Defines \"group I GHG\" to mean carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, or a perfluorocarbon. Defines \"group II GHG\" to mean HFCs.Authorized the Administrator to determine: (1) whether certain sources at a facility should be considered to be eligible for a de minimis exemption from such reporting requirements; and (2) the level of GHGs emitted that would qualify for such exemption. Requires each affected facility to submit: (1) required annual data by March 31, 2009, for a baseline period of 2004 through 2007; and (2) quarterly data no later than 60 days after the end of the applicable quarter for 2008 and each subsequent year.Authorizes the Administrator to waive reporting requirements for specific facilities if the Administrator determines that sufficient and equally or more reliable data are available under other provisions of law.Requires the Administrator, if information is not provided for an affected facility, to: (1) prescribe methods to estimate emissions for the facility reflecting the highest emission levels that may reasonably have occurred; and (2) take appropriate enforcement action. (Sec. 1106) Authorizes the Administrator to bring civil action in U.S. district court against the owner or operator of an affected facility that fails to comply with reporting requirements. Subjects any person violating reporting requirements to a civil penalty of no more than $25,000 per day of each violation.Subtitle B: Reducing Emissions - (Sec. 1201) Requires the Administrator to establish a separate quantity of emission allowances (the authorization to emit carbon dioxide equivalents of GHG) for each of 2012-2050. Provides that an emission allowance is not a property right.Sets forth emission allowances for 2012-2050, with a declining cap on GHGs.Requires the owner or operator a covered facility to submit to the Administrator an emission allowance, an offset allowance awarded to electric load-serving entities, or an international emission allowance for each carbon dioxide equivalent of a: (1) group I GHG that was emitted by the use of coal during the preceding year; (2) group I GHG that will, assuming no capture and sequestration, be emitted from the use of any petroleum- or coal-based liquid or gaseous fuel that was produced or imported during the preceding year; (3) group I GHG that was produced for sale or distribution or imported during the preceding year; (4) group II GHG that was emitted as a byproduct of HCFC production; and (5) group I GHG that will, assuming no capture and destruction or sequestration, be emitted from the use of natural gas that was processed, imported, or produced and not reinjected into the field or from the use of natural gas liquids that were processed or imported during the preceding year.Requires the Administrator to: (1) retire emission allowances immediately upon their receipt; or (2) determine whether the owners and operators of all covered facilities are in full compliance with requirements concerning emission allowances for the preceding year by July 1.Requires the Administrator to establish and distribute feedstock credits to entities that have used a petroleum- or coal-based product, natural gas, or a natural gas liquid as feedstock during 2012-2050 for the quantity of allowances that were submitted for that feedstock, minus the number of carbon dioxide equivalents of GHG that the facility released to the atmosphere from the feedstock.Requires the Administrator to establish and distribute to: (1) owners or operators of covered facilities that are subject to submission requirements and that have geologically sequestered carbon dioxide during any of years 2012-2050 quantities of emission allowances equal to the number of metric tons of carbon dioxide that the owners or operators sequestered; and (2) entities that have destroyed GHGs during any of such years a quantity of emission allowances equal to the number of carbon dioxide equivalents of GHG destroyed.Sets forth excess emission penalties. Requires the Administrator to deposit penalty receipts into the Treasury. Makes owners or operators of covered facilities that fail to submit emission allowances due by the deadline for any year liable to offset the excess emissions by an equal quantity during the following year (or such longer period as the Administrator may prescribe). Requires such owners and operators to submit a plan to achieve the required offsets to the Administrator and to the states in which the covered facilities are located. Requires such plan to be considered to be a condition of the operating permit for the covered facility. Requires the Administrator to deduct emission allowances equal to the excess emissions from each facility. Requires the owner or operator of any facility liable for a penalty and offset to: (1) pay the penalty; (2) provide such plan; and (3) offset excess emissions.Requires the Administrator, within two years, to expand the definition of \"covered facility\" to ensure the inclusion of all GHG emissions from natural gas emitted, flared during production or processing, or sold for use in the United States.Title II: Managing and Containing Costs Efficiently - Subtitle A: Trading - (Sec. 2101) Allows the lawful holder of an emission allowance to sell, exchange, transfer, submit for compliance, or retire such allowance. (Sec. 2102) Prohibits the privilege of purchasing, holding, selling, exchanging, and retiring emission allowances from being restricted to owners and operators of covered facilities.(Sec. 2103) Requires the Administrator to promulgate regulations to implement the provisions relating to emission allowances within 18 months, including regulations governing the transfer of allowances.Subtitle B: Banking - (Sec. 2202) Provides that the passage of time shall not, by itself, cause an emission allowance to be retired or otherwise diminish its compliance value.Subtitle C: Borrowing - (Sec. 2301) Requires the Administrator, within three years, to promulgate regulations under which the owner or operator of a covered facility may: (1) borrow emission allowances for a specific future year from the Administrator; and (2) submit borrowed emission allowances to the Administrator in satisfaction of up to 15% of its compliance obligation for a prior year. Prohibits allowances from being borrowed for any year that is more than five years earlier. Sets forth provisions governing the repayment of borrowed allowances.Subtitle D: Offsets - (Sec. 2401) Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Natural Resources Conservation Service, the Chief of the Forest Service, the Administrator of the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, and land-grant colleges and universities, to establish an outreach initiative to provide information to agricultural producers, agricultural organizations, foresters, and other landowners about opportunities under this Act to earn new revenue. Authorizes such initiative to include the creation and development of regional marketing centers or coordination with existing centers.Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, within two years, to publish a handbook on achieving, reporting, registering, and marketing offsets for use by agricultural producers, agricultural cooperatives foresters, and other landowners, offset buyers, and other stakeholders. Requires the Secretary to ensure that the handbook: (1) is electronically available; (2) includes electronic forms and calculation tools to facilitate the petition process for offset project approval; and (3) is distributed widely through land-grant colleges and universities.(Sec. 2402) Authorizes the owner or operator of a covered entity, beginning with 2012, to satisfy up to 15% of its total allowance submission requirement by submitting offset allowances.Requires the Administrator, within 18 months and in conjunction with the Secretary of Agriculture, to promulgate regulations authorizing the issuance and certification of offset allowances. Requires such regulations to: (1) require the owner of a project to establish a project baseline and register emissions under the Federal Greenhouse Gas Registry for offsets from sources of GHGs not linked to agricultural, forestry, or other land use-related projects; (2) authorize the issuance and certification of offset allowances for GHG emission reductions below the project baseline; and (3) ensure that those offsets represent a real, verifiable, additional, permanent, and enforceable reduction in GHG emissions or increases in sequestration.Requires such regulations for offsets from certain agricultural, forestry, and other land use-related projects to: (1) ensure that those offsets represent real, verifiable, additional, permanent, and enforceable reductions in GHG emissions or increases in biological sequestration; (2) specify the types of offset projects eligible to generate offset allowances; and (3) ensure permanence of offsets by mitigating and compensating for reversals.Provides that initial ownership of an offset alliance lies with a project developer, unless otherwise specified in a legally-binding contract or agreement.Authorizes such offset allowances to be sold, traded, or transferred on the conditions that: (1) the offset allowances have not expired or been retired or canceled; and (2) liability and responsibility for mitigating and compensating for reversals of registered offset allowances is specified.(Sec. 2403) Limits offset allowances from agricultural, forestry, and other land use related projects to those allowances achieving an offset of one or more GHGs by a method other than a reduction of combustion of GHG-emitting fuel. Sets forth categories of eligible offset projects.(Sec. 2404) Authorizes a project developer to submit a petition for offset project approval following the effective date of the domestic offset requirements. Prohibits developers from registering or issuing offset allowances until such approval is received and the emission reductions or sequestrations supporting the offset allowances have occurred. Requires a monitoring and quantification plan to be used to monitor, quantify, and discount reductions in GHG emissions or increases in sequestration. Requires a monitoring and quantification plan to be: (1) completed for all offset projects prior to offset project initiation; and (2) retained by the project developer for the duration of the offset project.Requires the Administrator, in conjunction with the Secretary of Agriculture, to specify the required components of a monitoring and quantification plan.
