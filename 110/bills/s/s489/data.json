Authorizes the EPA to provide grants to nonprofit organizations to assist in community and public education on healthy school environments.Requires the EPA to develop voluntary school site acquisition guidelines that account for: (1) efficient use of energy; (2) the special vulnerability of children to hazardous substances or pollution exposure where the potential for site contamination exists; (3) available modes of transportation; and (4) potential use of the school as an emergency shelter.Requires the Director to: (1) identify incentives to encourage the use of green buildings and related technology in federal government operations; and (2) consult with the Committee to assist in the implementation of the Environmental Stewardship Scorecard.Requires the Office to carry out specified demonstration projects at federal buildings and universities to contribute to its research goals."
