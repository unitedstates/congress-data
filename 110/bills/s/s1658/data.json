States that if a motion for change of custody of a child of such a member is filed while the member is so deployed, no court may enter an order modifying or amending a previous child custody judgment, except if there is clear and convincing evidence that it is in the best interest of the child. Prohibits any court from considering a member's absence due to deployment in support of a contingency operation in determining the best interest of the child."
