Requires the Secretary of Defense to conduct a comprehensive review of the U.S. nuclear posture to clarify U.S. nuclear deterrence policy and strategy. Expresses the sense of Congress that the President's review should be used as the basis for establishing future U.S. strategic arms control objectives and negotiating positions. Prohibits the appropriation or availability of funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead Program for FY2008-FY2010 until reports on the above reviews have been submitted to Congress."
