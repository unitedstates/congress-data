Authorizes the Secretary to provide financial assistance for not more than three fiscal years to enable an immediate response to outbreaks of harmful nonnative plant species that threaten or may negatively impact refuge resources that are at a stage at which rapid eradication or control is possible, and to ensure eradication or immediate control of such species. Directs the Secretary, consistent with the National Wildlife Refuge System Volunteer and Community Partnership Enhancement Act of 1998, to establish a cooperative volunteer monitoring and control program to administer and coordinate projects implemented by partner organizations concerned with national wildlife refuges to address harmful nonnative species that threaten national wildlife refuges or adjacent lands."
