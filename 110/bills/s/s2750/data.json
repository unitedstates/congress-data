Subjects production of locatable minerals from any mining claim, including mineral concentrates or products derived from such minerals, to a royalty of 8% of the gross income from mining. Imposes a 4% royalty upon federal lands subject to an existing operations permit and producing valuable locatable minerals in commercial quantities. Establishes a civil penalty for failure to comply with royalty requirements, including underreporting. Requires a hardrock mining claim maintenance fee and a location fee for each unpatented mining claim, mill, or tunnel site on federally owned lands, whether located before, on, or after enactment of this Act. Establishes a fee for transfer of ownership of an unpatented mining claim, mill, or tunnel site. Requires each operator of a hardrock minerals mining operation to pay a reclamation fee of 0.3 % of the gross income of the hardrock minerals mining operation for each calendar year.
