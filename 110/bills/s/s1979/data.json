Requires the induction and professional development programs to be: (1) integrated and aligned; (2) aligned with the state's school improvement efforts under title I of the ESEA; and (3) subject to a formal evaluation conducted by the state, institutions of higher education, or external agencies experienced in qualitative research. Permits LEAs to use school improvement funds under title I of the ESEA to supplement this Act's induction and professional development program grants."
