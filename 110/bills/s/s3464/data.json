Authorizes the President to impose certain economic sanctions on foreign countries that do not substantially comply with the benchmarks of an action plan. Directs the President to ensure that an intellectual property attach\u00e9 with the title of Minister-Counselor is placed in the U.S. embassy of each foreign country that has a commercially significant relationship with the United States."
