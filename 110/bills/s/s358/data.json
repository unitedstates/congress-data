    "text": "Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2007 - Title I: Genetic Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance - (Sec. 101) Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) to specify that genetic information that an issuer of group health insurance may not establish as an enrollment eligibility factor includes information about a request for or receipt of genetic services by an individual or family member. Prohibits a group health plan or a health insurance issuer from: (1) adjusting premiums on the basis of genetic information; or (2) requesting or requiring an individual or a family member of such individual to undergo a genetic test.Applies such provisions to small group health plans.Allows a participant or beneficiary to bring a civil action for violations of such prohibitions prior to the exhaustion of administrative remedies if it is demonstrated to the court that exhaustion of remedies would cause irreparable harm to the health of the participant or beneficiary. Allows a court to award equitable relief in such an action by retroactively reinstating coverage or assessing an administrative penalty.Authorizes the appropriate secretary to impose a penalty for any failure of a group health plan to meet the requirements of this Act. Limits such penalties if they are the result of reasonable cause and not willful neglect.
