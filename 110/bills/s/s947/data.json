Amends the National Housing Act to: (1) extend the maturity term for insured mortgages; (2) revise mortgage insurance eligibility criteria and requirements for premium charges; (3) authorize waiver of certain requirements for new product initiatives; (4) increase the maximum mortgage amount limit for multifamily housing in high-cost areas; (5) increase the FHA single family housing maximum mortgage limit; and (6) increase the capital ratio for the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. Increases prerequisites for insured mortgages covering condominiums to require that the condomium project have a HUD-insured blanket morgage."
