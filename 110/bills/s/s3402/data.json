    "text": "Consumer Health Education and Transparency Act of 2008 - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) the Office of Consumer Health Education and Information to provide consumers of health care services and health insurance with information concerning personal health and wellness and health insurance coverage. Requires the Secretary to: (1) require the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to develop standards for use by health insurance issuers in compiling and providing to enrollees a summary of benefits explanation that accurately represents the benefits and coverage provided by the issuer under the applicable health insurance plan; and (2) promulgate regulations to apply such standards.Directs health insurance issuers and federal health care programs to provide such a summary of benefits explanation to individuals prior to the effective date of coverage.Provides that such standards preempt related state standards that provide less information to consumers.Subjects entities that willfully fail to provide such information to fines.Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Office, to establish and implement a consumer health education and outreach initiative.Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a comprehensive study of matters related to improved consumer education on end-of-life care decisions and spending; and (2) award grants to local education agencies to develop and implement a personal health and nutrition curriculum in elementary or secondary schools."
