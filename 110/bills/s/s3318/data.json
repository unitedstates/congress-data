Makes the geographic index 1.0 in all fee schedule areas for physician services furnished on or after January 2010. Requires the Secretary, after calculating the practice expense geographic index, for purposes of payment for services furnished in 2009, to increase the practice expense geographic index to 1.0 for any locality for which such practice expense geographic index is less than 1.0. Requires the practice expense geographic index, for services furnished on or after January 1, 2010, to reflect half the difference between the relative costs of employee wages and office rents in each of the different fee schedule areas and the national average of such wages and rents."
