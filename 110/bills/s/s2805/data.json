    "text": "Rio Grande Pueblos Irrigation Infrastructure Improvement Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation, to: (1) conduct a study of irrigation infrastructure for 18 Rio Grande Pueblos in New Mexico; and (2) develop a list of projects recommended to be implemented over a 10-year period to repair, rehabilitate, or reconstruct such infrastructure. Requires the Secretary to carry out such activity with the consent of each individual Pueblo that notifies the Secretary of the intention to participate in the study and development of the list with respect to the Pueblo. Directs the Secretary, in developing that list, to: (1) consider specified factors, including the extent of disrepair, economic and cultural impacts, and overall benefits of the project to efficient water operations; and (2) prioritize the recommended projects based on a review of each of the factors and a consideration of the projected benefits. Sets forth reporting requirements. Authorizes the Secretary (subject to specified limitations) to provide grants to and enter into contracts or other agreements with the Pueblos to plan, design, construct, or otherwise implement recommended projects to repair, rehabilitate, reconstruct, or replace Pueblo irrigation infrastructure to: (1) increase water use efficiency and agricultural productivity for the benefit of a Pueblo; (2) conserve water; or (3) otherwise enhance water management or help avert water supply conflicts in the Rio Grande Basin. Prohibits the use of funds for the repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction of any major impoundment structure or for any on-farm improvements. Sets the federal share of the project's cost at 75%, with an exception based on financial hardship. Authorizes the Secretary to accept a partial or total contribution from: (1) the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District toward the nonfederal share required for a project carried out on land located in any of the Six Middle Rio Grande Pueblos if the Secretary determines that the project is a special project; and (2) the state toward the nonfederal share for a project carried out under this Act. Provides that nothing in this Act shall affect existing project-specific authority, U.S. responsibilities to any such Pueblo, Pueblo water rights, state water law, or an interstate compact governing water. Authorizes appropriations for the study, including for irrigation infrastructure grants for each of FY2010-FY2019."
