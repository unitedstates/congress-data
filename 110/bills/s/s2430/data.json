    "text": "Maritime Emergency Prevention Act of 2007 - Authorizes the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to command, using the Vessel Traffic Service (VTS), the pilot of a vessel to modify the speed or direction of a vessel in an emergency or hazardous conditions as determined by the local Coast Guard (CG) VTS director. Prohibits the filing of a civil action for damages against the Secretary or any officer in the exercise of their authority under this Act in any federal or state court. Requires a federally licensed pilot of a vessel to carry and use a laptop computer equipped with a navigation system in cases where state or local pilotage authorities determine that the use of such computer is practical and necessary."
