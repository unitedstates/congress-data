Makes the federal share of the project cost 100%. Authorizes appropriations. Waives, for such project, the $100 million per state single-failure (or, single-disaster) highway-related total obligation limitation. Amends the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users to authorize the Secretary to: (1) use such single-failure (or, single-disaster) highway-related funds for the repair and reconstruction of the Interstate I-35 bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota, that collapsed on August 1, 2007; and (2) use up to $5 million of such funds to reimburse the Minnesota state department of transportation for actual and necessary costs of maintenance and operation (less the amount of fares earned) for providing additional public transportation services and traveler information services as a substitute for highway traffic service following the collapse of the Interstate I-35 bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on August 1, 2007, until highway traffic service is restored on such bridge. Makes the federal share of the project cost 100%."
