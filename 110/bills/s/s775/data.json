Directs the Commission to develop recommendations regarding: (1) a federal infrastructure plan that will detail national infrastructure program priorities; (2) infrastructure improvements and methods of delivering and providing for infrastructure facilities; (3) analysis or criteria and procedures that may be used by federal agencies and state and local governments in inventorying existing and needed infrastructure improvements, assessing the condition of improvements, developing uniform criteria and procedures, and maintaining publicly accessible data; and (4) proposed guidelines for the uniform reporting by federal agencies of data regarding infrastructure improvements.(Sec. 7) Requires the Commission to submit an interim report and a final report to the President and to specified congressional committees.(Sec. 8) Makes funds available for each of FY2008-FY2010, at the Commission's request, from sums made available to the Secretary of Transportation (from any source other than the Highway Trust Fund), from the Corps of Engineers' General Expenses account, and from the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).(Sec. 9) Terminates the Commission on September 30, 2010."
