Authorizes the Secretary, in his or her discretion, to deem the appointment of an administrative patent judge or an administrative trademark judge who, before enactment, held office pursuant to an appointment by the director to take effect on the date on which the director initially appointed the administrative patent judge. Makes it a defense to a challenge to the appointment of an administrative patent judge or an administrative trademark judge on the basis of the judge's having been originally appointed by the director that the administrative patent judge so appointed was acting as a de facto officer."
