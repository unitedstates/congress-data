    "text": "Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education for the 21st Century Act of 2008 - Establishes the National Council for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education (STEM Council) as a federally chartered corporation composed of stakeholders in effective STEM education. Directs the STEM Council to: (1) identify critical deficiencies in STEM education systems and propose collaborative strategies that will allow Council members to address such deficiencies; (2) serve as an informational resource for the Department of Education (Department) and, through it, state and local educational agencies on effective STEM education practices; (3) promote STEM fields and the value of a STEM education to the public; and (4) maintain a public database on federal STEM scholarship and fellowship opportunities and other STEM and relevant non-STEM programs. Establishes, within the Council, a standing committee on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education (STEM Committee) composed of representatives from all federal departments and agencies involved in STEM education. Requires the STEM Committee to coordinate all federally funded or administered STEM education efforts and harmonize them with state and local efforts through the STEM Council. Directs the Secretary of Education to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the Department's STEM education programs."
