    "text": "National Capital Transportation Amendments Act of 2007 - Amends the National Capital Transportation Act of 1969 to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to provide additional funding through grants to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) to finance in part the capital and preventive maintenance projects included in the Capital Improvement Program. Subjects such grants to specified limitations and conditions. Prohibits funding to the WMATA until it notifies the Secretary that certain amendments to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Compact have taken effect, including: (1) requiring that all local payments for the cost of operating and maintaining the adopted regional rail system are made from dedicated funding sources (i.e., funding which is earmarked or required under state or local law to be used to match federal appropriations authorized under this Act for payments to the WMATA); (2) establishing the Office of the Inspector General of WMATA; and (3) expanding the WMATA Board of Directors to include four additional Directors appointed by the Administrator of General Services. Authorizes appropriations in increments over ten fiscal years beginning in FY2009. Establishes within WMATA the Office of Inspector General. Requires the Inspector General to make specified reports on Office activities: (1) semiannually, to the WMATA Board of Directors and General Manager who shall transmit reports to the appropriate committees or subcommittees of Congress; and (2) annually, to the Governors of Maryland and Virginia, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, and Congress. Requires the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the use of funds provided under this Act."
