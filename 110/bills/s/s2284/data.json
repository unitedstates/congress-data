    "text": "Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2007 - (Sec. 4) Amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (Act) to extend the national flood insurance program (Program) though FY2013. (Sec. 5) Requires the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to make national flood insurance available for multifamily properties of more than four units. (Sec. 6) Requires the FEMA Director to estimate the exclusion of certain prospective insureds from purchasing flood insurance at risk premium rates less than those estimated for specified properties (including any property not an individual's primary residence, severe repetitive loss property, and any business property). Sets an annual risk premium rate limitation of 25% for such properties. Prohibits the Director from providing flood insurance to prospective insureds at risk premium rates less than those otherwise estimated for new or lapsed policies. Increases from 10% to 15% the annual limitation on risk premium rate increases for any properties within any single risk classification. (Sec. 7) Instructs FEMA to issue final regulations establishing revised definitions of special flood hazard areas, including residual risk areas. Subjects such areas to mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements. (Sec. 8) Requires adjustment of flood insurance risk premium rates to reflect the current risk of flood to property located in an area participating in the Program. (Sec. 9) Adds a new requirement for those states and areas where flood insurance must be made available. Requires such states or areas to give satisfactory assurance that by December 31, 2008, state-chartered lending institutions not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shall be subject to state regulations consistent with the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. (Sec. 10) Amends the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 to increase from $350 to $2000 the civil monetary penalty for a single violation of the Act. Repeals the limitation upon the maximum penalty amount that may be imposed against any single regulated lending institution or enterprise in any calendar year. (Sec. 11) Revises the requirement that federal entities responsible for lending regulation require by regulation the payment of flood insurance premiums to a mortgage lender for deposit in an escrow account. Changes the property reference from real estate or mobile home to any property for which a loan has been made for purposes of acquisition or construction. Extends the same requirement to state entities responsible for lending regulations with respect to lending institutions they supervise. Requires any regulated lending institution, upon final payment of a mortgage, to notify the policyholder: (1) that insurance coverage may cease with such final payment; and (2) how flood insurance coverage may be continued after the life of the loan. (Sec. 12) Declares that the Secretary of the Treasury relinquishes the right to any repayment of loans to FEMA, subject to specified conditions, to the extent such borrowed sums were used to fund the payment of flood insurance claims resulting from the hurricanes of 2005. Increases from $1.5 billion to $20.775 billion, during FY2008 only, the maximum amount of loans and obligations the FEMA Director may issue to the Secretary of the Treasury with the President's approval for the Program.

Authorizes the National Flood Insurance Advocate, upon application by a qualified insured, to issue a Flood Insurance Assistance Recommendation to take or refrain from taking specified action, if the qualified insured is suffering a significant hardship, such as a significant delay in resolving claims while incurring significant resulting costs, or where the insured is at risk of adverse action, including the loss of property, as a result of the manner in which the flood insurance laws are being administered by the FEMA Director. Specifies required responses by the FEMA Director to such a Recommendation. (Sec. 32) Requires the Comptroller General to report to Congress on: (1) expansion of the Program; (2) pre-FIRM structures receiving discounted premiums; and (3) a review of the three largest FEMA contractors used in administering the Program."
