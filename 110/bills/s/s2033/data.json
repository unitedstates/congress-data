    "text": "Cell Phone Consumer Empowerment Act of 2007 - Requires that a wireless telephone service provider disclose, in a plain and conspicuous way, contract information regarding terms, charges, minutes, taxes and surcharges, and E-911 service in any publication of the contract, before a consumer enters into the contract, and in advertising. Requires wireless service bills to be clearly organized and use plain language, have taxes and fees in a separate section, and itemize roaming charges. Requires each provider to make available a map showing the wireless telephone service area of the provider and the wireless telephone service area of the provider in each state. Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to monitor the quality of wireless telephone service provided in the United States by requiring semiannual reports of wireless service providers. Requires that early termination fees be prorated over the term of a wireless subscriber's contract in a way that reasonably links the fee to recovery of the cost of the device or other legitimate business expenses. Regulates service contract extensions, cancellation penalties, and changes in rates, terms, or conditions. Amends the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to allow a member of the uniformed services to terminate a cellular phone service contract in specified circumstances involving service of at least 90 days. Preempts inconsistent state laws."
