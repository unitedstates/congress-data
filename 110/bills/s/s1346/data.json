Gives program allocation priority to interstate watersheds. Provides a cost-share payment exception for limited resource and beginning farmers.Provides: (1) cost-share and incentive payments for private forest owners to carry out specified conservation activities; and (2) state performance incentives.Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to offer to enter into agreements with states and the District of Columbia containing all or a portion of a large waterbody or its tributaries (including the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries) for water quality initiatives. Authorizes appropriations.Directs (current law authorizes) the Secretary to pay the cost of conservation innovation grants.
