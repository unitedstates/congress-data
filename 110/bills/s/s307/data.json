    "text": "Provides that the preferred rate of release of water from Yellowtail Dam located in Big Horn County, Montana, shall be not less than 2,500 cubic feet of water per second, with a minimum rate of 1,500 cubic feet of water per second. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation, to waive that minimum rate in case of emergency or if water levels in Bighorn Lake imminently preclude power generation at Yellowtail Dam. Includes the maintenance of a healthy fishery on the portion of the Bighorn River located downstream from the Yellowtail Dam among the purposes for which the Yellowtail Unit of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin Program is authorized. Directs the Secretary to ensure that any reclamation project carried out within the Bighorn River watershed is coordinated with other reclamation projects within the watershed."
