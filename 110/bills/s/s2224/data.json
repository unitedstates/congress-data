    "text": "Nuclear Release Notice Act of 2007 - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to direct the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to promulgate regulations that require civilian nuclear power facility licensees to notify the NRC and affected state and county governments within 24 hours of any release of fission products or other radioactive substances: (1) which exceeds allowable limits for normal operation; or (2) enters into the environment and may cause drinking water sources to exceed a maximum contaminant level established by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Requires the NRC, in developing such regulations, also to consider requiring notice to state and county governments if an unplanned release reaches the environment by a path otherwise not allowed or recognized by the facility's operating license, even though the release falls within allowable limits."
