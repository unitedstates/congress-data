Requires the Index to include: (1) measurements that examine barriers to physical activities across multiple settings; and (2) measurements to assist economically and culturally diverse communities in examining the social determinants of health.Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director, to award grants to state health departments for work in partnership with community-based coalitions to plan and implement model communities of play that: (1) increase the physical spaces and places available for physical activity; (2) increase the opportunities for children and families to participate in quality play and the number of children and families participating in quality play; and (3) increase knowledge and awareness about the importance of individuals achieving 60 minutes of recommended physical activity every day."
