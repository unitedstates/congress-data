Disapproves of the May 2008 Memorandum of Understanding between the government of the United States of America and the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Concerning Cooperation in Nuclear Energy and Other Energy Fields. Reiterates that the United States is committed to nuclear weapons nonproliferation and to preventing the Islamic Republic of Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons. States that: (1) no agreement for nuclear cooperation between the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia may enter into force on or after the date of the enactment of this Act; and (2) no nuclear materials and equipment or sensitive nuclear technology shall be exported or reexported, or transferred or retransferred, and no federal agency shall issue any license or authorization for the export or reexport, or transfer or retransfer of these items or assistance to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia if the end user is a nuclear production or utilization facility, or if the President determines that the material, equipment, technology, or item may be diverted to such a facility."
