Conditions any sale on a finding by the President that: (1) there is a severe energy supply interruption; or (2) the price of home heating oil threatens the health and safety of residents of the Northeast. Adds to the alternative determinations on whose basis the President may make such a finding a determination that the price of home heating oil has increased by such an extent that the Northeast is experiencing, or will experience, an emergency situation that threatens the safety and health of residents of the Northeast."
