Directs the Secretary to publicly solicit nominations of nonprofit organizations or institutions.Authorizes a recipient of an economic adjustment grant who determines that a revolving loan fund established using such assistance is no longer needed or that the recipient could make better use of the assistance to carry out another project that meets the requirements of the Act to request the Secretary to approve conversion of the assistance by: (1) selling fund assets to a third party; or (2) retaining repayments of principal and interest on loans provided through the fund. Requires such a recipient to use the net proceeds from a sale of assets to pay any portion of the costs of one or more projects that meet Act requirements. Directs the Secretary, before providing investment assistance for a construction project under such Act, to establish the expected period during which the assistance recipient shall make best efforts to achieve economic development objectives. Requires acquired or improved property to be held in trust by the recipient for the benefit of the project, and requires the Secretary to retain a reversionary interest in the property, during that period. Extends the authorization of appropriations for economic development assistance programs. Increases the minimum level of funding for planning and grants for administrative expenses."
