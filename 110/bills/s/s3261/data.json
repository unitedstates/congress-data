(Sec. 203) Directs the Secretary to make a grant under certain authority of the AIDS Housing Opportunity Act for any state that: (1) received an allocation in a prior fiscal year; but (2) is not otherwise eligible for an FY2009 allocation because the areas in the state outside of qualifying metropolitan statistical areas do not have the number of cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) otherwise required. Prescribes a formula for the allocation of such grants to Jersey City and Paterson, New Jersey. (Sec. 204) Requires any grant, cooperative agreement, or other assistance made pursuant to this title to be made on a competitive basis and in accordance with the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989.

Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) adjust FY2009 allocations under such Act, upon the written request of a grant applicant for a formula allocation on behalf of a metropolitan statistical area; and (2) designate the state or states in which the metropolitan statistical area is located as the eligible grantee(s) of the allocation. (Sec. 211) Requires the President's formal budget request for FY2010 and HUD's congressional budget justifications to use the identical account and sub-account structure provided under this Act. (Sec. 212) Declares that a public housing agency (PHA) (or other entity) that administers federal housing assistance for the Housing Authority of the county of Los Angeles, California, or the states of Alaska, Iowa, or Mississippi shall not be required to include a resident of public housing or a recipient of section 8 rental assistance (under the United States Housing Act of 1937) on the agency or entity board of directors (or similar governing board), as otherwise required by such Act. Requires each such PHA (or other entity) that chooses not to include such individuals on its agency or entity board of directors (or similar governing board) to establish an advisory board, which shall meet at least quarterly, consisting of at least six residents of public housing or section 8 rental assistance recipients to provide advice and comment on related issues. (Sec. 213) Authorizes the Secretary for FY2008-FY2009, subject to specified conditions, to authorize the transfer of some or all project-based assistance, debt and statutorily required low-income and very low-income use restrictions, associated with one or more multifamily housing project to another multifamily housing project or projects. (Sec. 214) Requires that the funds made available for Native American Housing Block Grants in title III of this Act be allocated to the same recipients that received funds in FY2005.

Declares that, for section 8 rental assistance eligibility purposes, any financial assistance (in excess of amounts received for tuition) that an individual receives under the Higher Education Act of 1965, from private sources, or an institution of higher education shall be considered income to that individual, except for a person over age 23 with dependent children. (Sec. 217) Authorizes the Secretary through FY2009 to insure, and enter into commitments to insure, home equity conversion mortgages (HECMs) for elderly homeowners. (Sec. 218) Requires the Secretary during FY2009, in managing and disposing of any multifamily property that is owned or held by HUD, to maintain any section 8 rental assistance payments attached to any dwelling units in the property. Authorizes the Secretary, however, to the extent that such a multifamily property is not feasible for continued section 8 payments, based on consideration of the costs of rehabilitating and operating the property and environmental conditions that cannot be remedied in a cost-effective fashion, to contract, in consultation with the property tenants, for project-based rental assistance payments with an owner or owners of other existing housing properties, or provide other rental assistance. Requires the Secretary also to take steps to ensure that project-based contracts remain in effect before foreclosure, subject to the exercise of contractual abatement remedies to assist relocation of tenants for imminent major threats to health and safety. (Sec. 219) Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to extend through FY2009 the authorization of appropriations for demolition, site revitalization, replacement housing, and tenant-based assistance project grants to PHAs. (Sec. 220) Authorizes PHAs that own and operate 400 or fewer public housing units to elect to be exempt from any asset management requirement imposed by the Secretary in connection with the operating fund rule. Prohibits exemption from such rule, however, for an agency seeking a discontinuance of a reduction of subsidy under the operating fund formula. (Sec. 221) Requires the Secretary to report quarterly to congressional appropriations committees on HUD's use of all sole source contracts.

(Sec. 223) Requires the Secretary to submit to specified congressional committees for FY2008-FY2009: (1) a complete and accurate accounting of the actual renewal costs for project-based section 8 assistance; and (2) revised estimates, and all sources, of the funding needed to fully fund all 12 months of all such project-based contracts. Requires the Secretary, as part of HUD's FY2010 budget request, to submit to such committees complete and detailed information, including a project-by-project analysis, that verifies that it will fully fund all such project-based contracts for FY2010, including expiring ones. (Sec. 224) Prohibits designation of a HUD official or employee as an allotment holder unless he or she has: (1) implemented an adequate system of funds control; and (2) received training in funds control procedures and directives. (Sec. 225) Requires: (1) payment of attorney fees in program-related litigation from individual program office personnel benefits and compensation funding; and (2) the annual budget submission for such funding to include the payment as a separate line item request. (Sec. 226) Rescinds $800 million from the unobligated balances remaining from funds appropriated for Tenant-Based Rental Assistance under the Department of Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act, 2008. Requires derivation of such amount from reductions to PHA calendar year 2009 allocations based on amounts in PHA net restricted assets accounts. (Sec. 227) Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 to provide that federally assisted housing also includes supportive housing for persons with disabilities under the Cranston-Gonzalez Affordable Housing Act. (Sec. 228) Amends the Home Investment Partnership Act with respect to the Secretary's authority to provide assistance for housing education and organizational support. Increases the annual limitation from 20% to 40% of total appropriations for such purposes that may go to any one contractor. Reduces from 40% to 25% the minimum amount of such funds available for single-state contractors. Modifies the terms of contracts in support of state and local affordable housing strategies to increase from 20% to 40% the maximum percentage of a contracting organization's budget operation that a contract may provide for each year. Extends through calendar 2011 the Secretary's authority to make grants under the Act for downpayment assistance to low-income families who are first-time home buyers. (Sec. 229) Requires the Secretary for FY2009 and thereafter to notify the public through the Federal Register and other appropriate means of the issuance of a notice of the availability of assistance or notice of funding availability (NOFA) for any program or discretionary fund that is to be awarded competitively. Requires the Secretary for such period to make the NOFA available only on the Internet at the appropriate government website(s) or through other electronic media. (Sec. 230) Authorizes the use to assist eligible multifamily housing projects of any amounts made available under previous appropriations Acts for technical assistance under the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 that currently remain available.. (Sec. 231) Amends the National Housing Act to revise, with higher maximums, the formula for determining the maximum principal loan obligation of a mortgage loan eligible for insurance. Repeals the prohibition against insurance of a first-time homebuyer mortgage involving a principal obligation, and related fees, exceeding 97% of the property's appraised value of the property unless the mortgagor has completed an approved homeownership counseling program. (Sec. 232) Amends the American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000 to revise requirements for prepayment of a loan providing HUD assistance for supportive housing for the elderly under the Housing Act of 1959 (as in effect before the enactment of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act). Deems a section 8 project-based rental assistance contract terminated (including all obligations and restrictions under it) if such assistance is no longer available to the project: (1) as a result of insufficient amounts of appropriated funds; or (2) on terms that would provide the project with income equivalent to such assistance. Authorizes the project owner, in such a situation, to charge tenants rent sufficient to meet debt service payments and operating cost requirements approved by the Secretary. Makes such a contract termination an eligibility event for purposes of tenant eligibility for enhanced low-income housing assistance vouchers under the United States Housing Act of 1937. Allows prepayment of such a loan to involve refinancing if it results in a transaction in which the project owner will address the physical needs of the project, subject to certain conditions. (Sec. 233) Prohibits the availability to any homeless group of designated surplus federal property unless the group is a member in good standing under any of HUD's homeless assistance programs or is in good standing with any other program receiving federal or state funds. Allows an exception to this requirement for an entity not involved with federal homeless programs if it meets specified financial, track record, and property management requirements. Permits the Secretary to rely on the entity's prior demonstrated fundraising ability or commitments for in-kind donations of goods and services. (Sec. 234) Declares that certain Tenant-Based Rental Assistance and Public Housing Capital Fund amounts provided to assist PHAs located within the most heavily impacted Hurricane Katrina or Rita disaster areas of Louisiana and Mississippi shall remain available in FY2009 for a PHA to combine certain housing assistance in order to facilitate the prompt, flexible and efficient use of such funds to assist families who were receiving such housing assistance immediately before Hurricane Katrina or Rita and were displaced from their housing by the hurricanes. (Sec. 235) Requires the Secretary to increase the number of Moving-to-Work agencies authorized under title II of the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996 by adding to the program three PHAs that are: (1) High Performing Agencies under the Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS); and (2) HOPE VI agencies. Bars a PHA from being granted this designation if it administers in excess of 5,000 aggregate housing vouchers and public housing units. Prohibits such designated PHAs from receiving more funding than they otherwise would have received without this designation. Title III: Related Agencies - Makes appropriations for FY2009 to: (1) the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board; (2) the Federal Maritime Commission; (3) the National Transportation Safety Board (with a certain rescission); (4) the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation; and (5) the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. Extends the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness through FY2012. Title IV: General Provisions (This Act) - Specifies certain uses and limits on or prohibitions against the use of funds appropriated by this Act. (Sec. 401) Requires any sums necessary for FY2009 pay raises for programs funded in this Act to be absorbed within the levels appropriated in this or previous appropriations Acts. (Sec. 402) Prohibits the use of funds for the planning or execution of any program to pay the expenses of, or otherwise compensate, nonfederal parties intervening in regulatory or adjudicatory proceedings funded in this Act. (Sec. 407) Requires all federal agencies and departments funded by this Act to report by July 31, 2008, to the congressional appropriations committees on all sole source contracts. (Sec. 409) Prohibits the use of funds to support any federal, state, or local projects that seek to use the power of eminent domain, unless eminent domain is employed only for a public use. (Sec. 410) Prohibits the transfer of funds to any federal department, agency, or instrumentality, except pursuant to a transfer made by, or transfer authority provided in, this Act or any other appropriations Act. (Sec. 411) Prohibits payment of the salary from any appropriation under this Act for any person filling a position (other than temporary) formerly held by an employee who has: (1) left to enter the U.S. Armed Forces; (2) satisfactorily completed his or her period of active military or naval service; (3) within 90 days after release from such service, or from hospitalization continuing after discharge for up to one year, applied for restoration to his former position; and (4) been certified by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) as still qualified to perform the duties of his or her former position, but not been restored to it. (Sec. 412) Prohibits the expenditure of funds by an entity unless it agrees that such expenditure will comply with the Buy American Act. (Sec. 413) Prohibits the availability of funds to any person or entity that has been convicted of violating the Buy American Act."
