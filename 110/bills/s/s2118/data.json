Requires reading instruction under the Reading First program to be research-proven or, at a minimum, meet the current requirement that it be scientifically-based. Defines \"research-proven reading programs\" as those that are deemed to be such programs by a Department of Education review panel and are evaluated in at least two studies, both of which meet specified minimum criteria that require the use of control groups."
