    "text": "Homeland Security Education Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require the Secretary of Education to award scholarships for the pursuit of bachelor degrees in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and critical foreign languages. Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary to award grants to: (1) school districts which upgrade their mathematics and science programs and work with private or state or local government entities willing to donate equipment, mentoring personnel, and higher education scholarships for students participating in the programs; (2) scientists and engineers who return to school to become teachers in their fields in needy schools; (3) partnerships between school districts and institutions of higher education working to enhance the recruitment and professional development of foreign language teachers; and (4) institutions of higher education which develop programs to immerse students in a foreign language while they study science, technology, or engineering here or abroad. Amends the David L. Boren National Security Education Act of 1991 to alter the terms of the work agreements required of recipients of scholarships and graduate fellowships in studies or languages critical to national security. Includes the Department of Homeland Security and Department of State among the agencies where service may be rendered. Sets federal employment and teaching alternatives when priority positions are unavailable. Directs the Secretary to award grants enabling institutions of higher education, in collaboration with elementary and secondary schools, to establish language learning pathways training students from elementary through graduate education to be proficient in critical foreign languages. Requires the Secretary to award scholarships to individuals proficient in critical foreign languages who return to school to become foreign language teachers in needy elementary or secondary schools. Amends federal law to create a student loan repayment pilot program for federal employees with critical science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and foreign language skills."
