    "text": "Spectrum Availability for Emergency-Response and Law-Enforcement to Improve Vital Emergency Services Act or the SAVE LIVES Act - Establishes the Public Safety Interoperable Communications Working Group to provide continuing advice to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Department of Homeland Security regarding public safety interoperable communications. Declares that the 24 MHz band of spectrum allocated to public safety services should be used by state, local, and regional public safety organizations for interoperable voice and data communications. Requires the FCC to complete a specified Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding the 700MHz Band and issue rules allowing certain channels within the current 24 MHz band of public safety spectrum to accommodate data communications. Requires the FCC to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the allocation for auction of the 30MHz band of recovered analog spectrum and establish specifications for a national public safety broadband network. Establishes the Public Safety Broadband Trust Corporation and requires, if no bidder is successful, granting it a license for the use of such spectrum. Specifies Corporation duties, including facilitating development of such network. Authorizes the FCC to enter into an agreement with the Corporation to guarantee loans to the Corporation. Pledges the full faith and credit of the United States for principal and interest."
