    "text": "National Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2007 - Amends the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 to establish aquatic invasive species reduction and prevention requirements for vessels (including towed vessels and structures) operating in U.S. waters. Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) to promulgate ballast water management regulations and certification procedures. Requires a program for Department of Defense (DOD) vessels to minimize the risk of invasive species through towed vessel hull and associated hull aperture transfers. Directs the Aquatic Invasive Species Task Force to establish a priority pathway management program that identifies those pathways that pose the highest risk for the introduction of aquatic invasive species. Prohibits the importation of an aquatic organism of a species not in trade without specified screening and approval. Requires the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to implement a national system of ecological surveys for rapid early detection and monitoring of invasive species. Establishes the Emergency Rapid Response Fund to assist states in implementing rapid response measures for aquatic invasive species. Requires the Task Force to approve state rapid response contingency strategies. Requires the National Invasive Species Council to establish a federal rapid response team for each of the ten federal regions. Consolidates the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal Dispersal Barrier Project and the project relating to the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal Dispersal Barrier into one project and requires certain actions regarding the project. Requires NOAA, the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, and the U.S. Geological Survey (Administering Agencies) to develop and conduct a marine and freshwater research program to assess rates of, patterns of, and conditions surrounding introductions of nonindigenous aquatic species in aquatic ecosystems and efforts to prevent the introduction of, and detect and eradicate, such species. Requires the EPA Administrator to develop an environmentally sound, cost-effective technology development, demonstration and verification grant program. Requires the Secretary and the EPA to develop a vessel pathway standards research program. Requires the National Science Foundation to establish a grant program for researchers at institutions of higher education and museums to carry out research in systematics and taxonomy. Requires the National Invasive Species Council to coordinate with the Task Force to combat aquatic invasive species. Requires the Task Force to recommend to appropriate federal agencies additions to the list of aquatic invasive species. Requires the Task Force, the Council, and the Secretary of State to ensure that international efforts to prevent and manage aquatic invasive species are coordinated with U.S. policies."
