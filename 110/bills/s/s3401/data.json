Prescribes related procedures, including restrictions on oral testimony. Stays any such application until all Military Commission proceedings regarding the covered individual have been resolved. Requires release of a covered individual, for whom the District Court grants a writ application and orders release, into the custody of the Secretary of Homeland Security for transfer to the individual's country of citizenship or another country."
