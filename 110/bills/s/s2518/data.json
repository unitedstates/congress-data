Eliminates all existing tax credits, but allows a $1,000 freedom to choose tax reform individual tax credit and a credit for overpayment of tax.Establishes the Commission on Congressional Budgetary Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies. Directs the President to: (1) designate two Commission co-chairpersons; (2) establish a systematic method for assessing the effectiveness and accountability of federal agency programs; (3) divide such programs into four equal budgetary parts; (4) submit to the Commission annual assessments of the programs within each part (one each year) that use such method; and (5) identify common performance measures for programs having similar functions and provide the Commission with data on such measures. Requires the Commission to: (1) evaluate executive agencies and their programs identified in each assessment; (2) consider submitted assessments in evaluating programs; and (3) submit to Congress each of the next four years a plan recommending agencies and programs that should be realigned or eliminated and proposing implementing legislation. Provides for expedited consideration of such legislation."
