Terminates the pre-stabilization rating: (1) when a veteran receives a permanent disability rating based on the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) schedule for rating disabilities; or (2) 365 days after the veteran's last separation or release from active duty. Allows the Secretary, when appropriate, to extend the pre-stabilization rating beyond such date."
