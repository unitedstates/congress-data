Requires the amount of any grant to be determined by the Secretary considering the financial need of, and state, local, and other operational funding provided to, the clinic.Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a program through which the Secretary shall provide clinics technical and other assistance in meeting requirements of this Act; and (2) develop and implement a plan for evaluating clinics funded."
