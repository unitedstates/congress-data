Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) to ensure such personnel are equipped with secure two-way communication devices and that existing personnel and new hires receive law enforcement training. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) construct additional ports of entry along the Northern and Southern U.S. borders; and (2) determine the location for new U.S. ports of entry. Requires expansion of the vehicle, cargo, and pedestrian inspection lanes at Eagle Pass, Texas, and Laredo, Texas. Exempts the provisions of this Act from: (1) the Administrative Procedures Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act; and (2) federal competitive contracting and hiring requirements. Authorizes appropriations, including for continued implementation of: (1) the Secure Border Initiative, the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, and the US-VISIT program; and (2) the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism."
