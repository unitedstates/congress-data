Authorizes a state to submit evidence to the Administrator that it has in place a legally enforceable sewage overflow notification program that is substantially equivalent to the notification requirements of this Act. Sets forth factors for determining substantial equivalency.Authorizes funding from state water pollution control revolving funds to carry out the monitoring of sewer overflows."
