Repeals, for taxable years beginning in 2007, the AMT for individual taxpayers whose adjusted gross income does not exceed $100,000 ($200,000 in the case of a joint return). Imposes, for taxable years beginning in 2007, a graduated increase in capital gains tax rates for any individual taxpayer whose adjusted gross income exceeds $1 million ($2 million in the case of a joint return). Exempts such a taxpayer from any estimated tax penalties resulting from an increase in capital gains tax rates in 2007."
