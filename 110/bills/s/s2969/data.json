Bases the rate of basic pay for appointees to the Office of the Under Secretary for Health on pay levels in the Senior Executive Service for equivalent positions.

Revises the calculation of leave for nurses working two 12-hour shifts on a weekend.

Prohibits a new appointment without the approval of the appropriate Network regional director. Requires each VHA medical facility to enroll practicing physicians in the Proactive Disclosure Service of the National Practitioners Database. Encourages the hiring of physicians who are board-certified or eligible for such certification in their field. Title II: Health Care Matters - (Sec. 201) Makes permanent the temporary authority to consider noninstitutional extended care services as covered VA medical services.
