Requires the Secretary to: (1) provide guidance to states, in collaboration with the Director of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), on interventions that may be incorporated into state cancer control programs to improve the long-term health status of childhood cancer survivors; (2) encourage states to incorporate strategies for improving their care into their comprehensive cancer plans; (3) collaborate with the NCI Director to improve or develop systems for tracking cancer survivors; and (4) enhance control programs to include a focus on childhood cancer survivorship. Directs the NCI Director to: (1) coordinate National Institutes of Health (NIH) activities regarding cancer survivorship; (2) make grants for research regarding pediatric cancer survivors and health disparities in cancer survivorship within minority populations; (3) conduct or support research to evaluate follow-up care for childhood cancer survivors; and (4) make grants to establish pilot programs to develop, study, or evaluate model systems for monitoring and caring for cancer survivors. Directs the Secretary to make grants to: (1) establish or improve training programs for health care professionals to improve follow-up care for young cancer survivors and to ensure that such care is linguistically and culturally competent; (2) pay costs incurred during the first four years of operating a clinic for comprehensive long-term followup services for childhood cancer survivors; and (3) improve physical and psychosocial care for such survivors."
