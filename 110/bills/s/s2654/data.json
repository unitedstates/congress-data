Requires the Secretary, in determining the amount of the allowance or reimbursement, to use the reimbursement rate for the use of privately-owned vehicles by government employees on official business. Authorizes the Secretary of the military department concerned to reimburse a member of the reserves for expenses incurred in connection with round-trip travel in excess of 100 miles to an inactive duty training location, requiring the same reimbursement rate as above."
