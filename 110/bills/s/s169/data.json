Eliminates requirements under the Act regarding: (1) the prohibition on the acquisition of lands and interests in the Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail and the Nez Perce National Historic Trail outside of the exterior boundaries of federally administered areas for such trails; and (2) the limitations on the designation of lands outside of such areas as segments of those trails. Revises Act provisions authorizing appropriations for the establishment and designation of national scenic and national historic trails. Limits funding for the acquisition of land or interests in land for, and for the development of, the Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail. Instructs the administering agency for the Trail to encourage volunteer trail groups' participation in the development of the Trail."
