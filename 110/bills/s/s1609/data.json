Requires the Secretary to prepare an analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 with respect to the process for issuing permits. Authorizes the Secretary to issue such permits. Prohibits considering offshore aquaculture \"fishing\" under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Prohibits permits for facilities within 12 miles of a coastal state if the state opposes the activities. Authorizes the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to designate a zone around a facility in which incompatible installations, structures, or uses are prohibited. Requires the Secretary of Commerce, for permits for facilities in certain areas subject to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, to obtain the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior and the consent of lessees, operators, and owners. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to: (1) establish and conduct an integrated, multidisciplinary, scientific research and development program to further marine aquaculture technologies that are compatible with the protection of marine ecosystems; and (2) conduct research and development in partnership with permit holders. Directs the Secretary to conduct research to reduce the use of wild fish in aquaculture feeds."
