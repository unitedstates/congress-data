Requires: (1) the Secretary to reschedule the payments due under specified loans; (2) such payments to commence when such additional obligations have been financially satisfied by the District; and (3) the date of the initial payment by the District to the United States to be regarded as the start of the repayment period and the time upon which any interest shall first be computed and assessed under the Small Reclamation Projects Act of 1956."
