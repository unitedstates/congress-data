Directs the Secretary to provide financial assistance for the development of facilities, technologies, and processes to demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of: (1) optimizing energy resource production by reducing the quantity of produced water generated; or (2) increasing the extent to which produced water may be recovered and made suitable for specified purposes. Requires such assistance to be provided for at least one project in: (1) each of the Upper Basin States (Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming); and (2) each of the Lower Basin States (Arizona, California, and Nevada). Prohibits such assistance from exceeding $1 million per project, from being used to pay more than 50% of the total project cost, or from being used for facility operation or maintenance."
