Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on such strategy and on child marriage and related U.S. assistance programs. Authorizes the President to provide assistance for programs to reduce the incidences of child marriage and promote the empowerment of girls, including support for the treatment and reduction of fistula in countries with high rates of such surgery. Requires the Secretary to work through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and other appropriate agencies as part of their ongoing research and data collection activities concerning child marriage. Requires the Secretary to include in the Department of State's Annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices a section for each country where child marriage is prevalent, outlining the status of the practice."
