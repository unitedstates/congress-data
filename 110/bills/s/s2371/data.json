Provides that, for married borrowers who file separate tax returns, income-based loan repayments under the HEA shall be determined solely on the basis of the individual borrower's student loan debt and adjusted gross income. Amends the Act to make technical amendments with respect to Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants."
