Instructs the Director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to lift: (1) the limitation on growth provision set forth in the Fannie Mae Consent Decree; and (2) the voluntary temporary growth limitation described in a certain Freddie Mac Letter. Requires 50% of such portfolio increase to be used on loans which have had or will have interest rate resets between June 2005 and December 2009."
