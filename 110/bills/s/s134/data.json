Designates the Southeastern Colorado Water Conservancy District, or its designee that is recognized under state law as an entity that has taxing authority, as the lead non-federal entity for the Conduit. Directs such entity to: (1) act as the official agent of the Conduit; (2) pay the non-federal share of any increased costs, including construction costs, under this Act; and (3) pay costs for and perform the operations, maintenance, and replacement of the Conduit. Sets the federal share of: (1) total planning, design, and construction costs at 80%; and (2) any increased costs that are a result of fundamental design changes conducted at the request of anyone other than such entity at 100%. Directs the Secretary, upon completion, to transfer ownership of the Conduit to such entity."
