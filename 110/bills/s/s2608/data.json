    "text": "Small Business Women's Procurement Program Improvement Act - Amends the Small Business Act relating to the women's procurement program (the provision of contracting opportunities for women-owned small businesses) to require the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to wait until five years after the program is implemented before conducting a required study to identify industries in which small businesses owned and controlled by women are underrepresented with respect to federal procurement contracting (and therefore eligible for contracting preferences or set-asides). Presumes as underrepresented by women-owned small businesses the industries identified in industry codes 11 through 81 of the 2007 North American Industry Classification System Code. States that a contracting officer need not make a finding of past gender discrimination by a contracting agency in order to comply with federal contracting requirements under the women's business procurement program."
