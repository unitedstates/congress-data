Requires such program to: (1) ensure centralized responsibility for the coordination of geothermal heat pump recommendations, practices, and activities of all relevant federal agencies; (2) provide technical assistance and operational guidance to tenants to achieve maximum feasible replacement of existing heating and cooling technologies with geothermal heat pump technologies within five years; and (3) establish methods to track the success of federal agencies with respect to that goal.Requires the Administrator to: (1) review the current use of geothermal heat pump technologies in GSA facilities and the availability of such technologies to facility managers; and (2) establish an acceleration program to achieve maximum feasible replacement of existing heating and cooling technologies with geothermal heat pump technologies in each GSA facility.Requires the Administrator to: (1) ensure that a manager responsible for accelerating the use of geothermal heat pump technologies is designated for each GSA geothermal heat pump technologies and practices facility; and (2) submit to Congress a plan for implementing, within five years, geothermal heat pump technologies and practices at GSA facilities."
