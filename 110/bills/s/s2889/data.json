    "text": "Veterans Health Care Act of 2008 - Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to contract to provide specialized residential care and rehabilitation services to a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom who suffers from a traumatic brain injury, has an accumulation of deficits in activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living and, because of these deficits, would otherwise require nursing home admission even though such care would generally exceed the veteran's nursing needs. Directs the Secretary to provide full-time board-certified physicians and dentists the opportunity to continue their professional education through VA sponsored continuing education programs. Authorizes (currently, directs) the Secretary to reimburse such physicians or dentists up to $1,000 per year for continuing professional education not available through VA sources. Exempts hospice care from requirements to pay a copayment in connection with hospital or nursing home care or medical services. Repeals a provision that prohibits the Secretary from performing widespread human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing but does allow voluntary testing of certain individuals. Authorizes the Secretary to disclose the name and address of present or former Armed Forces members and their dependents to collect charges for care or services provided for a non-service-connected disability. Removes provisions ending, on September 30, 2008, the Secretary's authority to obtain information from the Secretary of the Treasury or the Commissioner of Social Security under specified provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Directs the Secretary to increase certain disability compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation amounts."
