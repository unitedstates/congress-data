Requires the FCC, if mutually exclusive applications are submitted to use a channel under the amendments made by this Act, to award the authority to use the channel through competitive bidding under existing procedures. Prohibits the FCC from extending or renewing a full-power television broadcast license that authorizes analog service on or after February 17, 2013."
