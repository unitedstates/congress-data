Sets forth requirements that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must follow in immigration enforcement operations: (1) that are expected to target more that 50 individuals; and (2) respecting coordination with the Department of Labor and other relevant agencies. Sets forth protections for specified vulnerable populations. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) ensure that U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and other individuals are not unlawfully detained by establishing secure alternative custody programs; and (2) establish a detention advisory committee. Establishes within DHS a position of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Ombudsman."
