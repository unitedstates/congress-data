(Sec. 433) Amends the Inspector General Act of 1978 to require the heads of the NRO, DIA, NSA, and NGIA to appoint an independent inspector general for their agency (thus giving such inspectors general the same information-gathering power and independence as is currently held by inspectors general of other federal agencies).

(Sec. 436) Directs the Secretary of Defense, during the period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act and ending on December 31, 2008, to delegate to the NGIA Director personnel security clearance authority with respect to NGIA personnel that is identical to the authority held by the NSA Director over NSA personnel.
