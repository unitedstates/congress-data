Requires the Executive Director of the Board to submit a plan for the establishment and coordination of the Program. Requires the Board to promote and fund research and development (R&D), studies, and investigations with respect to: (1) improved forecast and decisionmaking technologies for weather mitigation operations, including tailored computer workstations and software and new observation systems with remote sensors; and (2) assessments and evaluations of the efficacy of weather mitigation. Authorizes the Board to establish a grant program for the awarding of grants to eligible entities (state agencies, institutions of higher education, and nonprofits that have expertise in the field of weather mitigation and experience working with state agencies) for R&D projects that pertain to weather mitigation. Permits a grant recipient to only use the grant for a R&D project that: (1) pertains to weather mitigation; and (2) was in operation on the day before the grant was awarded. Requires the submission of annual reports to the President and Congress on the activities conducted pursuant to this Act."
