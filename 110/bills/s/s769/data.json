Allows a program participant, if a high-need LEA or public charter school is not located within 50 miles of his or her residence, to teach within an LEA or at a public charter school: (1) experiencing a shortage of highly qualified teachers, especially in science, mathematics, special education, or vocational or technical education; or (2) receiving grant funds because of concentrations of children from low-income families."
