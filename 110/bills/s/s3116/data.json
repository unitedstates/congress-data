Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to: (1) establish an accreditation program for community mental health centers providing partial hospitalization services; (2) require a specified reduction in the OPD fee schedule increase factor for any such center that fails to submit required data on its partial hospitalization services; and (3) establish a minimum number of four units of items and services as a requirement for coverage of such services. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to require fiscal intermediaries under the Medicare program to file the cost reports of providers of partial hospitalization services into the Healthcare Provider Cost Reporting Information System (HCRIS) maintained by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services."
