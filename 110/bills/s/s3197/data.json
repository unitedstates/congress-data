(Sec. 3) Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on whether and to what degree members of reserve components of the Armed Forces and the National Guard: (1) avail themselves of the benefits of this Act; (2) are debtors in federal bankruptcy cases substantially related to service that qualifies them for such benefits ; and (3) are debtors in federal bankruptcy cases materially related to such service. Requires such study to include the effects that the use of this Act by such members has upon: (1) the bankruptcy system; (2) creditors; and (3) the debt-incurrence practices of such members.
