Commends: (1) those former combatant states of the Six Day War, Egypt and Jordan, who in subsequent years had the wisdom and courage to embrace peace and coexistence with Israel; and (2) Israel for its administration of Jerusalem for the past 40 years, during which Israel has respected the rights of all religious groups. Reiterates the commitment to the provisions of the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 and calls upon the President and U.S. officials to abide by its provisions. Urges the Palestinians and Arab countries to join with Israel in peace negotiations to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict, including the realization of Israeli and Palestinian democratic states."
