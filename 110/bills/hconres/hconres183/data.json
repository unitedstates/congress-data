Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the U.S. government should use all available means, including diplomatic channels, to encourage the government of Azerbaijan to release Farhad and Rafiq Aliyev from detention during trial and prosecute those individuals who beat and attack journalists; (2) the U.S. government should coordinate actions with appropriate international organizations; and (3) the OSCE should monitor such legal proceedings for compliance with the Helsinki Final Act."
