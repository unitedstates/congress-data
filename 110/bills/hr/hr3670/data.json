Directs a grant recipient to develop a promotion program to encourage international travel to the United States and to effectively communicate U.S. entry requirements, including required documentation, fees, and processes. Sets forth the following market phase-ins: (1) year one, Canada; (2) year two, Canada and Mexico; (3) year three, Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom; (4) year four, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Japan; and (5) year five, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany. Reserves 20% of grant funds for promotion programs for destinations that lack the resources to market themselves internationally."
