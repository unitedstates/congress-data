Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to prescribe the period of such initial admission as: (1) a minimum of six months; or (2) a different period determined on a case-by-case basis. Prohibits the admission or admission extension of such an alien if: (1) the alien previously violated nonimmigrant status conditions; (2) the alien is inadmissible as a nonimmigrant; or (3) the alien's border crossing card has not been processed through a machine reader at the U.S. port of entry or land border at which the person seeks U.S. admission."
