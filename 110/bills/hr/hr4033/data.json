    "as": "Introduced",

    "text": "Golf Course Preservation and Modernization Act - Requires the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service (NPS), to ensure that month-to-month concessions contracts are continued for the operation and maintenance of the Rock Creek, Langston, and East Potomac golf courses until the lease in force for East Potomac expires, at which time the lease entered into pursuant to this Act for the continued operation and maintenance of Rock Creek, Langston, and East Potomac as golf courses commences. Requires that such lease include the three golf courses in one lease agreement, and that they be operated and maintained in a manner that: (1) retains their historic nature; (2) at least two of the courses require fees related to use of the courses to be affordable; (3) may allow fees collected at one course to subsidize the maintenance and operation of at least one of the other courses; and (4) allows for a long-term ground lease on all three courses. Instructs the Secretary to solicit proposals, through a competitive process, to procure such lease. Authorizes the Secretary, after such solicitation, to enter into agreements to procure the lease. Specifies that the request for proposals be solicited in such a manner: (1) to provide that the lease be entered into not later than 180 days after this Act's effective date or not later than 30 days after expiration of the concession contract for East Potomac; and (2) which ensures the participation of disadvantaged business enterprises among the equity partners of the sponsors of the proposals."
