Defines \"taxpayer bailout\" as: (1) placement of the issuer under conservatorship, receivership, or other assumption of the management, governance, and control of the issuer by the Treasury or by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve; or (2) an emergency loan of public funds made to the issuer by the Treasury or the Board, if the Board Chairman determines that such a loan is necessary to prevent the issuer's imminent failure."
