    "text": "Small Business Contracting Program Improvements Act - Title I: Ensuring Government Contract Opportunities for Small Business Concerns Owned and Controlled by Service-Disabled Veterans - (Sec. 101) Amends the Small Business Act to: (1) permit agencies to enter into contracts with a small business owned and controlled by a service-disabled veteran without first ensuring that there is only one company can perform a contract; and (2) allow contracting officers to decide whether or not to set aside contracts where at least two underutilized business zone (HUBZone) qualified companies could compete for the contract. (Sec. 102) Provides for the assessment of civil penalties against any company that misrepresents itself as a small business owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans for purposes of federal contracting preferences. (Sec. 103) Directs the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to comply with Executive Order No. 13360 and provide federal contracting information, training, and other assistance to small businesses owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans. (Sec. 104) Requires the Administrator, in implementing section 101 above, to give a priority to certified service-disabled veterans that are severely disabled.
