Requires the use of such grants to ensure that current and future teachers are highly qualified by: (1) reforming teacher preparation programs so that teachers are able to understand scientifically-based research and use advanced technology effectively in the classroom; (2) providing preservice clinical experience and mentoring to prospective teachers, and increased interaction between IHE faculty and new and experienced elementary and secondary school teachers and administrators; (3) implementing initiatives to promote the retention of highly qualified teachers and principals; (4) awarding need-based scholarships for students in teacher preparation programs; (5) disseminating information on effective teacher preparation practices; and (6) conducting certain other activities authorized under title II."
