    "text": "Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act - Title I: Federal Oil and Gas Leasing - Subtitle A: Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing - (Sec. 101) Prohibits oil and gas preleasing or leasing of any area of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) that was not available for oil and gas leasing as of July 1, 2008, unless that action is expressly authorized by this Act or a statute enacted by Congress after enactment of this Act. (Sec. 102) Authorizes oil and gas leasing, preleasing, or other related activities for any area that: (1) is in any OCS Planning Area in the Atlantic Ocean or Pacific Ocean located farther than 50 miles from the coastline; and (2) was not otherwise available for oil and gas leasing, preleasing, and other related activities as of July 1, 2008. (Sec. 103) Requires approval by law of an adjacent state for oil or gas leasing in any area located within 100 miles from the adjacent state's coastline and within its seaward lateral boundaries. (Sec. 104) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) ensure that any activity under this subtitle is carried out in a manner that protects the coastal environment, marine environment, and human environment of state coastal zones and the OCS: and (2) review all applicable federal regulations to ensure environmentally sound oil and gas operations on the OCS. (Sec. 105) Requires any oil and gas leasing of OCS areas to be conducted in accordance with the July 2, 1983, \"Memorandum of Agreement between the Department of Defense and the Department of the Interior on Mutual Concerns On The Outer Continental Shelf\" and any revisions made after January 21, 2009. Declares that the United States reserves the right to designate by and through the Secretary of Defense, with the President's approval, national defense areas on the OCS. (Sec. 106) Prohibits oil or gas leasing in: (1) any marine national monument or national marine sanctuary; or (2) the fishing grounds known as Georges Bank in the waters of the United States. (Sec. 109) Instructs the Secretary to establish goals to ensure equal opportunity to bid on offshore leases for qualified small, women-owned, and minority-owned exploration and production companies. Authorizes the Secretary to implement outreach programs for qualified historically underutilized exploration and production companies to participate in the bidding process for offshore leases. Subtitle B: Diligent Development of Federal Oil and Gas Leases - (Sec. 121) Requires: (1) diligent development of lands subject to federal oil and gas leases; and (2) the Secretary to promulgate regulations establishing what constitutes diligent development. (Sec. 124) Instructs the Secretary to collect and report to Congress annually specified resource estimates and leasing program management indicators. Subtitle C: Royalties Under Offshore Oil and Gas Leases - Royalty Relief for American Consumers Act of 2008 - (Sec. 132) Requires the Secretary to agree to any lessee request to amend any oil and gas lease issued for any Gulf of Mexico tract during 1998-1999 to incorporate specified price thresholds applicable to royalty suspensions. (Sec. 133) Reaffirms the Secretary's authority to vary royalty suspensions under certain leases based on the price of production. (Sec. 134) Prescribes eligibility requirements for new leases and lease transfers. Directs the Secretary to establish conservation of resources fees for both producing and nonproducing federal oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico. (Sec. 135) Establishes a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve to: (1) hold the net increase in federal receipts resulting from this Act; and (2) offset certain future costs. Subtitle D: Accountability and Integrity in the Federal Energy Program - (Sec. 141) Adds to requirements for federal receipt of oil or gas as royalties in-kind a requirement that receiving royalties in-kind be consistent with the Secretary's fiduciary duties on behalf of the American people. (Sec. 142) Requires the Secretary to take all steps necessary to ensure that lessees under leases for exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas on federal lands are making prompt, transparent, and accurate royalty payments under such leases.
