Amends the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act to repeal certain rules of origin requirements with respect to goods made of nonoriginating material that are produced in a foreign-trade zone or subzone that enter a U.S. customs territory. Adds a rule with respect to goods produced entirely in the territory of one or more NAFTA countries, but where any nonoriginating materials, provided for as parts and used in a good's production, do not undergo a change in tariff classification. Requires, in such an instance, that a good be treated as originating in a NAFTA country if: (1) the regional value-content of the good is at least 60% where the transaction value method is used, or at least 50% where the net cost method is used; and (2) the good satisfies all other applicable requirements."
