Prohibits any person from operating a special firearms event without notifying the Attorney General. Sets forth: (1) responsibilities of special firearms events operators and of firearms licensees and transferors other than licensees at such events, including with regard to criminal background checks; (2) special firearms event license application requirements; and (3) penalties for violation of this Act. Authorizes a state to apply to the Attorney General for, and sets forth criteria for, certification of the 24-hour verification authority of that state with respect to criminal background checks. Increases penalties for: (1) serious record keeping violations by licensees; and (2) violations of criminal background check requirements."
