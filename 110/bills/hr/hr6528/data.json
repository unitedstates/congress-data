Excludes from such prohibition a group health plan offered to employees of a small employer, except upon request of the employer for a consistent limit.Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to contract with the Institute of Medicine for a study to determine the number of individuals who have reached the lifetime limitations set forth in this Act."
