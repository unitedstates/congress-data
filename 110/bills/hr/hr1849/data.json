Amends the Small Business Act to direct the SBA Administrator to implement a program to: (1) provide outreach and assistance to credit unions to increase their participation in the SBA small business loan program; (2) simplify the application process for such participation; and (3) provide a guaranty of up to 85% for loans made by credit unions to their members in underserved areas."
