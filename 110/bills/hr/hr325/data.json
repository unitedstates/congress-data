    "text": "Standards to Provide Educational Achievement for Kids Act or the SPEAK Act - Amends the National Assessment of Educational Progress Authorization Act (the Act) to require the Commissioner for Educational Statistics to add science to the mandatory biennial national and state academic achievement assessments of students in grades four, eight, and twelve in reading and mathematics. Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to require states receiving school improvement funds to participate in such science assessments of students in grades four and eight, beginning with the 2008-2009 school year. Amends the Act to task the National Assessment Governing Board with creating or adopting voluntary American education content standards in mathematics and science for kindergarten through grade 12 which reflect the knowledge students need to enter college or the workforce and compete in the global economy. Requires the Secretary of Education to establish the American Standards Incentive fund to award competitive four-year grants to states which agree to: (1) adopt such voluntary mathematics and science standards as the core of their own academic content standards in such subjects; and (2) align their teacher certification and professional development requirements to such standards. Provides additional funds to successful grantees for the enhancement of their student performance data systems. Authorizes the Secretary to extend by two to four years for such grantees the 12-year period at the end of which students must meet or exceed state academic performance standards established under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965."
