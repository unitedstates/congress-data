Provides for reimbursement to a Band only for litigation expenses and expert witness fees incurred prior to June 22, 1999. Requires that a Band's claim for reimbursement of expended funds be certified by the Band as being unreimbursed to it from other funding sources. Requires the Secretary to review the claims and determine if the fees and expenses are properly documented and incurred in the litigation of the claims before the Court in Docket Nos. 19 and 188. Requires the Bands to update their membership rolls to include all living enrolled members. Subjects the membership rolls to the review and approval of the Secretary. Sets forth provisions for the: (1) division of the judgment funds; and (2) development of separate tribal plans for the use and distribution of such funds."
