Directs the Secretary to carry out a joint psychological health program to: (1) increase access to and the provision of psychological health care and related services for members of the National Guard following their deployment, and their families; (2) improve coordination among DOD components in the provision of such care during members' transition from active duty to civilian life; and (3) coordinate and oversee DOD efforts to assist members of the National Guard with mental illness and members with traumatic brain injury post-deployment. Requires the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to establish the National Guard Psychological Health Council. Directs the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs to jointly carry out: (1) one or more pilot programs on the provision of mental health services to members of the National Guard and reserves, both before and after deployment, through telemental health technologies; and (2) an outreach program intended to reduce the stigma, among members of the National Guard and reserves returning from deployment, and their families, associated with seeking and obtaining mental health services.
