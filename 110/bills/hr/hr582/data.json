Allows such preference to be given to institutions of higher education (IHEs) that are: (1) educating regular education personnel to meet the needs of children with disabilities in integrated settings; (2) educating special education personnel to work in collaboration with regular educators in integrated settings; or (3) successfully recruiting and preparing individuals with disabilities and individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the profession for which the IHE is preparing individuals. Allows such preference also to be given to local educational agencies, other public agencies, and private nonprofit organizations that: (1) provide training to regular education personnel to meet the needs of children with disabilities in integrated settings; (2) provide training to regular education personnel to work in collaboration with regular educators in integrated settings; or (3) prepare individuals with disabilities and individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the profession for which the entity is preparing individuals."
