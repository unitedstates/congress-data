Allows such mortgage to be guaranteed only if it is secured by a dwelling, farm residence, or manufactured home permanently affixed to a lot that is owned and occupied by the elderly veteran homeowner. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) guarantee any mortgage given to refinance an existing home equity conversion mortgage guaranteed by the Secretary; (2) establish a mortgage guarantee fee; and (3) waive the mortgage guarantee fee in certain circumstances."
