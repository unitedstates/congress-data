    "text": "Presidential Library Donation Reform Act of 2007 - Amends federal law regarding presidential archival depositories to require any presidential library fundraising organization to submit quarterly reports to the National Archives and Records Administration and specified congressional committees on every contributor who: (1) respecting a Presidential archival depository (including a depository of a President who currently holds the Office of President) for which the Archivist of the United States has not accepted, taken title to, or entered into an agreement to use any land or facility for the archival depository, gave a contribution or contributions (whether monetary or in-kind) totaling $200 or more for a quarterly period; or (2) respecting such a depository for which the Archivist has accepted, taken title to, or entered into an agreement to use any land or facility for the archival depository, gave the organization a contribution or contributions (whether monetary or in-kind) totaling $1, 250 or more for a quarterly period. Requires the submission of such information to continue to apply to a Presidential library fundraising organization during the lifetime of the President whose archives benefit from such fundraising. Requires the Archivist to make such information available to the public through the Internet (or a successor technology readily available to the public) as soon as is practicable after each quarterly filing. Requires that such information be made available without a fee or other access charge, in a searchable, sortable, and downloadable database. Prohibits knowing and willful submissions of false information or omissions of material information by contributors or the fundraising organization. Prescribes criminal penalties for violation of such prohibitions. Prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully: (1) making a contribution described above in the name of another person; (2) permitting his or her name to be used to effect such a contribution; and (3) accepting such a contribution that is made by one person in the name of another person. Prescribes penalties for violation of such prohibition. Requires the Archivist to promulgate regulations to carry out this Act. Makes this Act: (1) applicable to an organization established to raise funds for creating, maintaining, expanding, or conducting activities at a Presidential archival depository or any facilities related to such a depository; and (2) only applicable with respect to contributions (whether monetary or in-kind) made after enactment of this Act."
