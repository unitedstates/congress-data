Defines \"defraud a drug test\" to mean to: (1) submit a substance that purports to be from an individual other than its actual source, or purports to have been excreted or collected other than when it was actually excreted or collected; or (2) engage in any other conduct with the intent to produce a false or misleading outcome of a test for the presence of a controlled substance. Grants the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforcement powers as a violation of an unfair or deceptive act or practice."
