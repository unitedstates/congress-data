Requires the Secretary to conduct the study and develop the report with the support and participation of one or more specified state and local entities. Allows the Secretary if such state and local entities do not support and participate in the study and report to: (1) decrease the area covered by the study area, as appropriate; or (2) opt not to conduct the study or develop the report and notify specified congressional committees of such decision. Prohibits anything in this Act from authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to take any action that would affect the use of any land not owned by the United States."
