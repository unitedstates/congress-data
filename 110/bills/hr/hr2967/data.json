    "text": "Campaign Taxpayer Reimbursement Act of 2007 - Prohibits the use of federal funds to carry out or support any travel undertaken by a covered executive branch official away from his or her designated post of duty if at any time while the official is away he or she attends any political campaign or fundraising event, unless the official's office is reimbursed by the appropriate political committee for the actual travel costs incurred. Makes special rules for presidential and vice presidential travel. Applies this Act to travel by Members of the House of Representatives. Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to require political committee reimbursement of certain state and local government security costs resulting from attendance by a covered executive branch official, other than the President or Vice President, at a political campaign or fundraising event."
