Directs OPIC to provide notice of consideration of approval of a project to provide financing of $10 million or more which significantly involves an extractive industry (as defined by this Act) to the appropriate congressional committees not later than 60 days before approval. Gives preference to projects where the investor and the host country have agreed to implement Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative principles.(Sec. 6) Provides for increased project transparency. Directs OPIC to maintain an Office of Accountability to provide project problem-solving services and to review OPIC compliance with environmental, social, worker rights, human rights, and transparency policies.(Sec. 7) Sets forth provisions respecting transparency and accountability of OPIC investment funds. (Sec. 8) Prohibits OPIC assistance for any railway connection that connects Azerbaijan and Turkey without traversing or connecting with Armenia.(Sec. 9) Prohibits OPIC assistance to an applicant who is involved in a \"discouraged transaction\" with state sponsors of terrorism.

(Sec. 12) Directs OPIC to: (1) report to House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on the feasibility of broadening OPIC assistance to projects that provide support to low-income home buyers; and (2) provide such assistance if feasible.(Sec. 13) Requires that OPIC commit adequate staff and resources to assist small businesses and investors in the United States obtain insurance, reinsurance, financing, and other types of OPIC support.(Sec. 14) Makes technical corrections."
