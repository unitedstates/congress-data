Provides for the issuance of ski area permits for the use and occupancy of suitable lands within the National Forest System for skiing and other snow-sports and such other seasonal or year-round recreational activities associated with mountain resorts as the Secretary of Agriculture may authorize pursuant to this Act.Allows the Secretary to authorize the holder of a ski area permit issued pursuant to the Act to also provide on lands subject to such permit such other seasonal or year-round outdoor and natural-resource based developed recreation activities and associated facilities, in addition to skiing and other snow-sports, as determined appropriate.Prohibits any activity or facility from being authorized under this Act if its authorization would result in the primary recreational purpose of lands subject to a ski area permit not being skiing or other snow-sports."
