Requires prekindergarten providers to target children from families with incomes at or below 200% of the poverty line and provide them with program services free of charge. Directs state grantees to set aside: (1) at least 10% of a grant for quality early childhood development programs for children ages zero through three; and (2) at least 10% of a grant to extend the hours of early childhood programs to create extended day and year programs."
