    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "2007-11-01", 
    "text": "Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007 - (Sec. 3) States this Act applies to any mining claim, millsite claim, or tunnel site claim: (1) located under the general mining laws before, on, or after the date of enactment of this Act; or (2) used for beneficiation or mineral processing activities, regardless of whether legal and beneficial title to the mineral is held by the United States. Title I: Mineral Exploration and Development - (Sec. 101) Conditions federal issuance of a patent for any mining or millsite claim located under the general mining laws upon specified determinations by the Secretary of the Interior. (Sec. 102) Subjects production of locatable minerals, including mineral concentrates or products derived from such minerals, to a royalty of 8% of the gross income from mining. Imposes a 4% royalty upon federal lands subject to an existing permit. Subjects to specified royalties certain federal land added to an existing operations permit. Sets forth royalty payment requirements governing claim holders, operators, and transporters. Makes each person liable for royalty payments under this Act jointly and severally liable for royalty on all locatable minerals, concentrates, or derived products lost or wasted from a mining claim maintained in compliance with this Act when such loss or waste is due to negligence on the part of any person or due to the failure to comply with any rule, regulation, or order issued under this Act. Establishes a civil penalty for failure to comply with royalty requirements. (Sec. 103) Sets forth a hardrock mining claim maintenance fee for each unpatented mining claim, mill, or tunnel site on federally owned lands, whether located before, on, or after enactment of this Act. Requires waiver of such fee for a claimant who certifies in writing that on the payment due date the claimant and all related parties held not more than 10 mining claims, mill sites, or tunnel sites, or any combination of them on public lands, and had performed requisite assessment work. States that nonpayment of the claim maintenance fee constitutes a forfeiture of the unpatented mining claim, mill, or tunnel site. (Sec. 104) States that timely payment of the claim maintenance fee asserts claimant's authority to use and occupy the federal land concerned for prospecting and exploration. Title II: Protection of Special Places - (Sec. 201) States that mining claims may be located under the general mining laws only on such lands and interests as were open to location immediately before enactment of this Act. Designates the following lands as not open to location of mining claims under the general mining laws on or after the date of enactment of this Act: (1) wilderness study areas; (2) areas of critical environmental concern; (3) areas designated for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System (including areas designated for potential addition, or eligible for inclusion in such system); and (4) any area identified in certain inventoried roadless areas maps contained in the Forest Service Roadless Area Conservation Final Environmental Impact Statement. (Sec. 202) Permits a state, political subdivision, or Indian tribe to petition the Secretary for withdrawal of specific federal land from operation of the general mining laws in order to protect specific values that are important to such entities.
