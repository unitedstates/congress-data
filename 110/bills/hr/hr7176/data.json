Makes it unlawful for any person who is not the owner or authorized user of a protected computer to prevent reasonable efforts by such owner or authorized user to: (1) block the installation of a peer-to-peer file sharing program that intentionally obtains files on the protected computer or makes such files available to another computer; or (2) disable or remove any peer-to-peer file sharing program that intentionally obtains files on the protected computer or makes such files available to another computer. Treats a violation of this Act as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or deceptive act or practice prescribed under the Federal Trade Commission Act."
