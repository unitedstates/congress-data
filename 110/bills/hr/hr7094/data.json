Amends the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 to repeal the temporary conforming loan limit increase for the enterprises.Amends the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act to repeal provisions governing enterprise authority to purchase and sell certain insured and conventional mortgages and to engage in certain lending activities.Amends the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 to repeal the new housing price index.Amends the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 to repeal certain conforming loan limits.Requires the enterprises to pay state and local taxes.Instructs the Director to assess each enterprise for the amount necessary to recoup to the federal government the full value of the benefit the enterprise receives from federal guarantees for its obligations and financial viability.
