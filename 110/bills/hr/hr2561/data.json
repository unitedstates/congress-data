States that: (1) such system shall provide an administrative process for an individual to apply to correct any information retained by the system; and (2) such corrective process shall not be construed as creating a private right of action and no court shall have jurisdiction on any case or claim arising from the application of such system or corrective administrative process. Authorizes: (1) the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection to require each vessel, vehicle, and aircraft arriving in the United States from, or departing the United States to, a foreign port or place to transmit to United States Customs and Border Protection a passenger manifest and crew manifest; (2) a civil penalty for non-compliance; and (3) sharing of manifest and passenger name record information with other government agencies."
