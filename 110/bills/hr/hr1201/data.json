Prohibits any person from being liable for copyright infringement based on the design, manufacture, or distribution of a hardware device or of a component of such device if the device is capable of substantial, commercially significant noninfringing use. Makes the prohibition on the circumvention of a technological measure (to descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or to otherwise avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure without the authority of the copyright owner) that effectively controls access to a protected work non-applicable to a person by reason of that person's engaging in a noninfringing use of any of the six classes of of copyrighted works set forth in the determination of the Librarian of Congress in Docket No. RM 2005-11, as published as a final rule by the Copyright Office, Library of Congress, effective November 27, 2006. Excludes specified acts of circumvention from such prohibition."
