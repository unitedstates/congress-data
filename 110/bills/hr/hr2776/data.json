Title I: Production Incentives - (Sec. 101) Extends through 2012 the tax credit for the production of electricity from renewable resources (e.g., wind, closed and open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, small irrigation power, municipal solid waste, and qualified hydropower). Imposes a limit on such tax credit based upon investment in renewable resource facilities placed in service after 2008 in lieu of the current phaseout provisions for such credit.(Sec. 102) Includes marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy as a renewable resource for purposes of the tax credit for producing electricity from renewable resources.(Sec. 103) Extends through 2016 the energy tax credit for investment in solar energy and fuel cell property.Allows an offset against alternative minimum tax liability for certain energy tax credit amounts.Increases to $1,500 the credit limitation for fuel cell property. Allows public electric utility property to qualify for the energy tax credit.(Sec. 104) Allows a new tax credit for investment in qualified new clean renewable energy bonds.
