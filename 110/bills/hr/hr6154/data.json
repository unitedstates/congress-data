Specifies reimbursement levels based on a commuter vehicle's estimated fuel economy rating by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Requires such a reimbursement to be available to a commuter only if: (1) the average cost of gasoline across the country exceeds $2.75 per gallon; and (2) the state has sufficient funds to provide such reimbursement."
