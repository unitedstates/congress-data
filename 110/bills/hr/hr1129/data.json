Requires St. Louis County to: (1) ensure that the project is constructed, operated, and maintained in a manner that would not cause any future additional flood damage that would not have occurred without the project; and (2) identify and agree to restrict a nearby parcel of land of equal or greater size to such deed restricted land so that such parcel is maintained for open space, recreation, or wetland management. Declares that the federal government shall not be liable for future flood damage caused by the project. Makes St. Louis County, Missouri, or its assignee liable for any such damage. Declares that the deed-restricted property specified by this Act is not eligible for any future disaster assistance from any other federal source."
