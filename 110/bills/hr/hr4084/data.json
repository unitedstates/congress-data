    "text": "Veterans Quality of Life Study Act of 2007 - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to contract with the Institute of Medicine, or other appropriate entity, to conduct a study analyzing the extent to which the Department of Veterans Affairs schedule for rating disabilities accounts for or should be amended to account, measure, and compensate for loss of quality of life to veterans due to a disability resulting from a personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty. Provides that if a veteran who is a claimant dies before completing the submission of a claim for benefits, the person who would receive any accrued benefits due to such veteran shall be treated as the claimant for purposes of completing submission of the claim. Requires an annual report from the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) to the congressional veterans' committees summarizing the Court's workload. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Court should be provided with appropriate office space, without undue disruption, inconvenience, or cost. Requires a report from the Administrator of General Services to the veterans' committees on the feasibility of leasing additional space for the Court, and using the entire building in which the Court is now housed as a Veterans Courthouse and Justice Center."
