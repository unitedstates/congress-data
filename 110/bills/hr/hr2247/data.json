Allows such an extension until the later of the end of the course or 12 weeks, in the case of an educational institution not regularly operated on a quarter or semester basis. Repeals the: (1) 14-year (after first becoming entitled) limit on the use of educational assistance by members of the Selected Reserve; and (2) ten-year limit on the use educational assistance by members of the Ready Reserve who are separated due to disability after supporting contingency and certain other operations."
