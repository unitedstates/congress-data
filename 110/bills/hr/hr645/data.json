    "text": "Comprehensive Strategy for Iraq Act of 2007 - States that authority for the President to use the Armed Forces in Iraq as provided by P.L. 107-243 expires on December 31, 2007. Prohibits the obligation or expenditure of funds for the purpose of establishing or maintaining a permanent U.S. military presence in Iraq through the establishment or use of military installations or facilities in Iraq intended to be under the exclusive control of the Armed Forces rather than under the control of the government of Iraq. Directs the President, within 30 days after enactment of this Act, to report to Congress outlining a strategy to end U.S. combat operations in Iraq. Authorizes the President to provide assistance: (1) for Iraqi employment projects upon a certification to Congress that the government of Iraq has concluded an agreement for the sharing of power and resources among major ethnic and sectarian factions in Iraq; and (2) to strengthen democracy, governance, human rights, the rule of law, and religious freedom in Iraq. Directs the President to appoint two Presidential Special Envoys for Iraq Regional Security who shall: (1) enter into discussions with the government of Iraq and governments of neighboring countries to support Iraq's peace efforts and to take necessary actions to prevent regional instability; (2) organize a regional conference on Iraq's future; (3) organize an Iraq Support Group to coordinate regional and international policy in support of Iraq's peace efforts; and (4) work with officials of the government of Iraq and other domestic stakeholders to organize a forum for national reconciliation negotiations. Expresses the sense of Congress that the U.S. government should redeploy necessary diplomatic, political, and military assets to: (1) complete Operation Enduring Freedom, including to defeat remaining Taliban and al Qaeda forces threatening Afghanistan; and (2) support efforts to dismantle terrorist networks in other regions of the world."
