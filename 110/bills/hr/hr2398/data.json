Transfers specified authorities of the Department of Agriculture and other authorities to the Institutes. Sets forth organizational and funding provisions. Amends the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 to repeal authority for the National Agricultural Research, Extension, Education, and Economics Advisory Board. Eliminates specified funding provisions respecting agricultural research at 1890 land-grant colleges. Extends and revises specified agricultural programs, including research, extension, and education programs. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish the Borlaug International Agricultural Science and Technology Fellowship Program to provide fellowships for scientific training in the United States to individuals from eligible countries who specialize in agricultural education and research and extension."
