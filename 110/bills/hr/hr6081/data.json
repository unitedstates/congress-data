(Sec. 103) Makes permanent the exemption from the first-time homebuyer rule for veterans using mortgage revenue bonds to purchase a residence. Increases the issuance limits on mortgage revenue bonds for veterans in Alaska, Oregon, and Wisconsin to $100 million after 2009. Revises the definition of \"qualified veteran\" for mortgage bond financing eligibility purposes to eliminate the pre-1977 active duty requirement and to reduce the eligibility period to 25 years.(Sec. 104) Requires tax-qualified pension plans to entitle survivors of plan participants who die while on active military duty to additional benefits and benefit accruals provided under such plans for participants who resume and then terminate employment due to death.(Sec. 105) Treats differential wage payments to an employee as a payment of wages for income tax purposes. Defines \"differential wage payment\" as any employer payment to an individual serving on active duty in the uniformed services for more than 30 days that represents wages such individual would have received if such individual were performing services for the employer.Treats an individual receiving differential wage payments as an employee and treats such payments as compensation for retirement plan purposes.(Sec. 106) Allows members of the uniformed services whose retired pay in any taxable year is reduced due to an award of disability compensation by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) an extension of the three-year limitation period for filing tax refund claims until one year after the date of a disability determination. Limits the period for which such refund claims may be filed to taxable years beginning more than five years before the date of a disability determination.(Sec. 107) Makes permanent the penalty exemption for premature withdrawals from retirement plans for individuals called or ordered to active military duty on or after December 31, 2007. (Sec. 108) Makes permanent the authority of the Social Security Administration (SSA) to disclose tax return information to the VA for purposes of making veterans benefit determinations.
