Prohibits: (1) recalculation of amounts allocated for surface transportation projects under the Equity bonus program for a fiscal year to take such rescissions into account; and (2) the transfer of funds from the General Fund of the Treasury in order to alleviate the deficit in the HTF (except amounts equivalent to certain taxes and penalties). Expresses the sense of Congress that state transportation departments should consider implementing certain projects under the highway bridge program and the surface transportation program that improve transportation safety."
