States U.S. policy with respect to Iraq, including that the United States should: (1) begin withdrawing its Armed Forces from there; (2) continue assisting the Iraqi government with rebuilding and reconstruction efforts; and (3) provide humanitarian assistance to displaced Iraqi refugees. Directs the Secretary of Defense to begin the withdrawal of U.S. Armed Forces from Iraq within 30 days after the enactment of this Act, and to complete such withdrawal by January 20, 2009. Prohibits funds appropriated to the Department of Defense (DOD) from being expended: (1) to increase the number of U.S. forces in Iraq; or (2) for the construction of permanent U.S. military installations in Iraq. Allows DOD to retain members of the Armed Forces in Iraq for: (1) protection of the United States Embassy; (2) limited counterterrorism activities directed at the al-Qaeda terrorist network; (3) nonoffensive military actions to address humanitarian concerns; and (4) assisting the Iraqi military in securing Iraq's borders. Requires the Secretary of Defense to submit to Congress a strategy for removing U.S. Armed Forces from Iraq by the required deadline."
