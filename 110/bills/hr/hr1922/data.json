Withdraws the federal lands and interests in such land included within the Outstanding Natural Area from: (1) all forms of entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; (2) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws, and (3) operation of the mineral leasing and geothermal leasing laws and the mineral materials laws. Revokes certain Executive Orders and a certain public land order. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Commandant of the Coast Guard, to: (1) develop a comprehensive management plan to provide long-term management guidance for the public land in the Outstanding Natural Area; and (2) ensure that the Outstanding Natural Area fulfills the purposes for which it is established. Requires the Secretary to: (1) manage the Outstanding Natural Area as part of the National Landscape Conservation System; and (2) in a manner that conserves, protects, and enhances the unique and nationally important historical, natural, cultural, scientific, educational, scenic, and recreational values of the Outstanding Natural Area, including an emphasis on the restoration of native ecological systems. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) enter into cooperative agreements with federal, state, county, other local government agencies, and other partners (including the Loxahatchee River Historical Society) for the long-term management of the Outstanding Natural Area; and (2) acquire for inclusion in the Outstanding Natural Area any state or private land or any interest in state or private land that is adjacent to the Outstanding Natural Area and identified in the management plan as appropriate for acquisition. Prohibits restrictions on specified law enforcement activities and ongoing and future Coast Guard operations in the Outstanding Natural Area. Authorizes appropriations."
