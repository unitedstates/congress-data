    "text": "After School Partnerships Improve Results in Education Act or ASPIRE - Directs the Secretary of Education to award competitive matching grants to partnerships, composed of a state or local educational agency and at least one college or nonprofit, community, tribal, business, labor, or career technical student organization, for the development of national model after-school interdisciplinary education programs for secondary school students. Directs the Secretary to allot grants to states for matching subgrants to other partnerships, composed of such entities, for the development of after-school interdisciplinary education programs for secondary school students. Gives grant and subgrant priority to programs targeting a high percentage of impoverished, struggling, or rural students and their families. Requires each partnership grantee and subgrantee to include in its program: (1) at least one activity involving mathematics and science education, language arts, writing, and reading, or history, geography, or social studies; and (2) at least one activity involving career technical education, business and entrepreneurial education, health and wellness, the environment and conservation, or arts and music education. Allows program activities to take place after school, before school, or at any other time that the school is not in session. Directs the Secretary to carry out national activities, such as providing technical assistance to grantees and subgrantees, and conducting a national evaluation of such programs."
