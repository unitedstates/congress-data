Authorizes the Secretary to provide additional assistance for an extraordinary hardship. Prohibits the Secretary and the Secretary of Homeland Security from implementing a specified plan for a single implementation date for sea and land borders until they have certified to Congress that Department of State passport agencies are able to process passport applications with minimal disruption."
