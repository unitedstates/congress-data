Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to deposit the amounts generated from such additional tariffs into the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund created by the Social Security Act. States that, for purposes of this Act, the People's Republic of China shall not be construed to include Taiwan or any island over which Taiwan exercises jurisdiction."
