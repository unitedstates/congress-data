Exempts any lawfully authorized investigative, protective, or intelligence activity of the United States, a state, or a local law enforcement agency or of an U.S. intelligence agency from the prohibitions of this Act.(Sec. 3) Authorizes appropriations for FY2008-FY2011 to the Attorney General for prosecutions needed to discourage the use of spyware and practices commonly called phishing and pharming. (Sec. 4) Expresses the sense of Congress that the Department of Justice should vigorously prosecute those who use spyware to commit crimes and those that conduct phishing and pharming scams."
