Allows the Attorney General (AG), upon authorization of the President, to apply to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (Court) for an order, or the extension of an order, authorizing for up to one year the acquisition of communications of persons outside the United States who are non-U.S. persons. Allows the AG to authorize such surveillance without a court order for up to 15 days if the AG determines that an emergency situation exists with respect to obtaining such information before an order authorizing the surveillance can be obtained. Authorizes the AG, in either case, to direct a communications service provider, custodian, or other person who has access to such information to furnish the AG with the required information and to maintain appropriate records concerning acquisition of the information."
