Requires the Administrator to enter into arrangements with participating Centers to provide: (1) access to regulatory information and resources; (2) training and education activities; (3) confidential counseling to owners and operators of small businesses regarding compliance with federal and state regulations; and (4) technical assistance. Directs the Administrator to contract with the Association to act as the repository of and clearinghouse for data and information submitted by Centers. Requires the Administrator, giving substantial weight to the Association's recommendations, to select the Centers programs of two states from each of ten groups of states for participation in the program. Authorizes the Administrator to make additional selections after three years, with a preference for programs that have a plan for consulting with federal and state agencies to ensure that assistance provided under this act is not duplicated by any other federal or state program. Sets forth the formula for determining program grant amounts. Provides a minimum grant amount of $250,000."
