(Sec. 4) Directs the Commission to designate as \"at-risk counties\" those counties in the Appalachian region that are most at risk of becoming economically distressed.(Sec. 5) Authorizes additional appropriations to the Commission through FY2011 to carry out Appalachian regional development and its economic and energy development initiative under section 3. Requires that funds approved by the Commission for a project in a state in the Appalachian region pursuant to congressional direction be derived from such state's portion of the Commission's allocation of appropriated amounts among the states. (Sec. 6) Extends, for five years, the termination date of the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 (with exceptions for the Appalachian development highway system and certain definitions). (Sec. 7) Includes within the Appalachian region the following areas: (1) Metcalfe, Nicholas, and Robertson counties in Kentucky; (2) Ashtabula, Fayette, Mahoning, and Trumbull counties in Ohio; (3) Giles, Lawrence, Lewis, and Lincoln counties in Tennessee; and (4) Henry and Patrick counties in Virginia."
