Requires such information to include: (1) the name, gender, race, ethnicity, and age of the deceased; (2) the date, time, and location of death; (3) the law enforcement agency that detained or arrested the deceased; and (4) a description of the circumstances surrounding the death. Grants states 120 days from the enactment of this Act to comply with such reporting requirements. Permits the Attorney General to grant additional time to states to comply with reporting requirements and to waive such requirements in states where compliance would be unconstitutional.Grants the Attorney General discretion to reduce by up to 10% the amount of the criminal justice assistance grants of states that fail to comply with the reporting requirements of this Act. Requires the Attorney General to collect information and provide for a study on the deaths of persons held in custody and to report to Congress on the findings within two years after the enactment of this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
