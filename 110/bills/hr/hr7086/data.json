Creates an interagency working group to make recommendations to coordinate federal actions and programs to promote domestic manufacture and export of nuclear energy products and services. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to prescribe: (1) a qualifying nuclear power manufacturing credit; (2) a nuclear power facility construction credit; (3) a five-year accelerated depreciation for new nuclear power facilities; and (4) a special rule for the allocation of credit among public-private partnerships that own an advanced nuclear power facility. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 revise administrative procedures for licensing new nuclear power plants. Establishes a Joint Committee on Nuclear Energy to make recommendations to promote domestic nuclear energy. States that, for the period following the licensed operation of any facility for the treatment or storage of spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste, no consideration of the public health and safety, common defense and security, or environmental impacts of such storage is required regarding the development, construction, and operation of, or any permit, license, or siting approval for, a civilian nuclear power reactor or any facility for nuclear fuel or waste treatment or storage. United States High Level Nuclear Waste Management Corporation Act - Amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to establish the United States High Level Nuclear Waste Management Corporation.Terminates the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. Requires the Secretary of Energy, in specified circumstances, to propose an adjustment to the fee for electricity generated from civilian nuclear power reactors.
