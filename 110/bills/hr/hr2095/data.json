    "text": "Division A: Rail Safety - Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 - (Sec. 3) Authorizes appropriations for FY2009-FY2013 for: (1) railroad safety; (2) the purchase of Gage Restraint Measurement System vehicles and track geometry vehicles or other comparable technology to assess track safety; and (3) construction of the Facility for Underground Rail Station and Tunnel at the Transportation Technology Center, Inc., in Pueblo, Colorado. Title I: Railroad Safety Improvements - (Sec. 101) Requires the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to: (1) make safety in railroad transportation the highest priority in carrying out its duties; and (2) have a Deputy Administrator and an Associate Administrator for Railroad Safety, who shall be the FRA's Chief Safety Officer. (Sec. 102) Directs the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to: (1) develop a long-term railroad strategy for improving railroad safety to cover at least five years; and (2) report annually to Congress on the FRA's performance in achieving its strategic goals and annual plans. (Sec. 103) Directs the Secretary to require each Class I railroad carrier, a railroad carrier that has inadequate safety performance, or a railroad that provides intercity passenger or commuter rail passenger transportation to develop, submit for Secretary approval, and if approved implement a railroad safety risk reduction program, including risk mitigation, technology implementation, and fatigue management plans, to reduce the rate of railroad accidents and injuries. Requires the Secretary to ensure that railroad carriers required to submit a technology implementation plan with a schedule for implementing a positive train control system comply with that schedule and implement such system by December 31, 2018. (Sec. 104) Requires each Class I railroad carrier and each entity providing intercity or commuter rail passenger transportation to develop and submit for Secretary approval a plan for implementing a positive train control system by December 31, 2015. Grants the Secretary authority to assess civil penalties for violation of related requirements. (Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary to establish a grant program for the deployment of certain train control and other railroad safety technologies, with priority to projects that focus on making technologies interoperable between railroad systems, accelerate train control technology deployment on high-risk corridors, or benefit both passenger and freight safety and efficiency. Authorizes appropriations for FY2009-FY2013. (Sec. 106) Directs the Secretary to report annually to Congress on the specific actions taken to implement unmet statutory railroad safety mandates and each open railroad safety recommendation made by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) or the Department of Transportation (DOT) Inspector General. (Sec. 107) Declares that no railroad safety rule or order issued by the Secretary shall be effective if it incorporates by reference a code, rule, standard, requirement, or practice issued by a nonfederal association or other entity, unless the date on which the code, rule, standard, requirement, or practice was adopted is specifically cited in the rule or order, or the code, rule, standard, requirement, or practice has been subject to notice and comment under a federal railroad safety rule or order. (Sec. 108) Revises the definition of a signal employee to eliminate the requirement that he or she be employed by a railroad carrier (thus including signal employees employed by contractors or subcontractors). Revises hours of service requirements for a train employee. Prohibits a railroad carrier, and its officers and agents, from requiring a train employee to remain or go on duty or be in any other mandatory service: (1) where the employee has spent in any calendar month a total of 276 hours on duty, or waiting for deadhead transportation (limbo time), or in deadhead transportation from a duty assignment, to a place of final release; (2) for more than 12 consecutive hours; or (3) unless the employee has had at least 10 consecutive (currently, eight consecutive) hours off duty during the previous 24 hours. Prohibits requiring or allowing such an employee to remain or go on duty after that employee has initiated an on-duty period each day for: (1) six consecutive days, unless the employee has had at least 48 consecutive hours off duty at the employee's home terminal; or (2) for seven consecutive days, if permitted by a collective bargaining agreement, unless the employee has had at least 72 consecutive hours of duty at a home terminal. Caps the total number of hours that a train employee may spend in limbo time, or in deadhead transportation from a duty assignment to the place of final release, following a 12-consecutive hour period on duty, that is neither time on duty nor time off duty, unless the train is delayed by an accident, a major equipment failure, or a delay resulting from a cause unknown and unforeseeable to a railroad carrier. Revises hours of service requirements for signal employees, including signal employees of contractors or subcontractors. Repeals the requirement that a signal employee have at least eight consecutive hours off duty during any 24 hour period. Makes 12 consecutive hours the maximum time on duty, unless the employee has had at least 10 consecutive hours off duty during the previous 24 hours.Prohibits a signal employee from being allowed to go on duty under certain emergency authority to conduct routine repairs, routine maintenance, or routine inspection of signal systems. Prohibits a railroad from communicating with a train or signal employee during time off duty, except to notify the employee of an emergency situation. Prescribes requirements for application of the hours of service regime to commuter and intercity passenger railroad train employees. Authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations that make certain additional changes to hours of service requirements in order to improve safety and reduce employee fatigue.Directs the Secretary to conduct at least two pilot projects to analyze specific practices which may be used to reduce fatigue for train, engine, and other railroad employees. (Sec. 109) Prohibits the Secretary from disclosing to the public any information obtained as part of a railroad's risk reduction program or pilot program, except to enforce or carry out federal law.
