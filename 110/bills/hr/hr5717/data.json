    "text": "Inform and Deter Spam Act or the ID Spam Act - Amends the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 to authorize the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), on it's motion or at it's direction, to add a civil penalty amount obtained for a violation of the Act to a fund to provide rewards to individuals who provide violation information. Authorizes the CPSC, in its sole discretion, to grant a reward up to $100,000 to any individual who provided valuable violation information which resulted in a final court order against any violators. Declares that the receipt of a reward under this section does not constitute immunity from criminal liability. Makes it unlawful to provide false information. Authorizes regulations providing for procedures to protect informants' anonymity."
