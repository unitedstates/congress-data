Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase: (1) limitations for the nonbusiness energy property tax credit; (2) the applicable amount for the new energy efficient home credit; and (3) the per square footage dollar amount for the energy efficient commercial buildings deduction. Requires the Secretary to study and make recommendations to Congress on whether to conform certain Internal Revenue Code incentives, as provided in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, to the building energy performance goal established under this Act."
