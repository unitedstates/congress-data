Requires the administering agencies to: (1) develop standardized protocols for conducting ecological and pathway surveys of such species; (2) conduct research to identify the relationship between the introduction and establishment of such species; and (3) analyze the data collected and develop a profile that determines whether a species planned for importation is likely to invade an aquatic ecosystem. . Requires the U.S. Geological Survey to develop a central, national pathway and ecological surveys database of information. Makes the Invasive Species Council responsible for disseminating such information and develop a national strategy for how it will be shared with federal, state, and local entities. Requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop a grant program to fund research, development, demonstration and verification of environmentally sound, cost-effective technologies and methods to control and eradicate such species. Reauthorizes the ship pathway technology demonstration program. Requires the Coast Guard and the EPA to develop a research program to support implementation of ship pathway standards to prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by ships. Requires the National Science Foundation to establish a grant program for researchers at institutions of higher education and museums to carry our research programs in systematics and taxonomy."
