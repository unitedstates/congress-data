Authorizes appropriations for FY2009-FY2014. (Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary to implement a program of new regionally diversified demonstrations of advanced energy storage systems to expand upon the existing technology demonstration program of the Department of Energy (DOE). Urges such demonstrations to include the participation of a range of stakeholders, such as rural electric cooperatives, investor owned utilities, municipally owned electric utilities, energy storage systems manufacturers, electric drive vehicle manufacturers, the renewable energy production industry, state or local energy offices, the fuel cell industry, and universities. Authorizes appropriations for FY2009-FY2014. (Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary to implement a demonstration program of electric drive vehicle energy storage technology, including integration of such systems on a prototype vehicular platform with drivetrain systems for passenger, commercial, and nonroad electric drive vehicles. Requires such demonstrations to be conducted through consortia, which may include the same range of stakeholders suggested for the advanced energy storage systems demonstration program. Authorizes appropriations for FY2009-FY2014. (Sec. 7) Instructs the Secretary to carry out a program of research, development, and demonstration of: (1) secondary applications of energy storage devices following service in electric drive vehicles; and (2) technologies and processes for final recycling and disposal of these devices. Authorizes appropriations for FY2009-FY2014. (Sec. 8) Requires the Secretary to carry out the programs under this Act in compliance with the requirements of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) for cost sharing and impartial review of the scientific and technical merit of award proposals."
