Requires the CPSC, after receiving notice of a voluntary recall by a manufacturer or retailer, to post notice on the CPSC's website and notify the health department of each state. Requires the manufacturer of a product for children under five to label the product or its packaging to enable the purchaser to determine production information. Requires the CPSC to establish a database as a clearinghouse for information regarding factories, warehouses, or other facilities where consumer products which have been subject to a recall were manufactured."
