Requires such statistics to be based on the following measures of income: (1) full benefits poverty income (equal to the sum of partial benefits poverty income and noncash benefits attributable to the members of a household); and (2) full benefits and taxes poverty income (equal to full benefits poverty income increased by state and federal earned income tax credits, refundable child credits, and any other refundable tax credit and decreased by state and federal income and payroll taxes attributable to the members of a household).Requires the Bureau to use such measures to produce corresponding tables and graphs showing for each year: (1) the partial benefits poverty rate; (2) the full benefits poverty rate; and (3) the full benefits and taxes poverty rate."
