Makes survivors and dependents eligible for educational assistance until their 30th (currently 26th) birthday. Makes the aggregate amount of educational assistance $80,000. (Currently, there are monthly limits for full-time, three quarter-time, or half-time educational pursuit.) Includes within authorized educational pursuits in such amounts: (1) a program of apprenticeship or other on-job training; and (2) a correspondence course. Makes survivors and dependents eligible for tutorial assistance."
