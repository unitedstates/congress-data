    "text": "American Energy Independence Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) provide for tax credits for energy efficiency, alternative and unconventional fuel, and nuclear power; and (2) revise provisions concerning tax credits for renewable energy and energy efficiency.Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to require the Secretary of Energy (Secretary) to make loan guarantees for advanced conservation and fuel efficiency motor vehicle technology projects for the production of vehicles that do not exceed 10,000 pounds.Includes among projects eligible for assistance under the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program projects for the operation and maintenance of intelligent transportation system strategies that serve nonattainment or maintenance areas.Requires the: (1) Secretary of Transportation to establish a program to develop jet fuel produced from clean coal and from alternative and unconventional domestic feedstocks; and (2) Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to designate an institution that has existing facilities and experience in the development and deployment of such technologies as the Center for Excellence for Coal-to-Jet-Fuel Research.Designates a fund comprised of revenues from fees for loan guarantees as the Incentives for Innovative Technologies Fund.Limits payments made by the Secretary for costs that result from certain nuclear plant delays to costs that occur after the initial 30-day period of covered delay and that are no more than $500 million per contract.Requires the Secretary to implement a Nuclear Power 2010 Program. Establishes an interagency working group to promote increasing domestic manufacture capacity and export of domestic nuclear energy products and services.Requires the Secretary of Labor to implement a program to provide workforce training for the nuclear utility and nuclear energy products and services industries.Amends the Atomic Energy Act to revise provisions concerning hearings and judicial review for proceedings on licenses or construction permits.Requires the Secretary to establish a National Nuclear Energy Council. Authorizes the Secretary to initiate spent nuclear fuel storage agreements. Amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to revise provisions concerning contracts for the transportation and disposal of high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel of domestic origin. Requires the Secretary to offer to settle actions for damages resulting from failure to commence accepting such fuel or waste on or before January 31, 1998. Prohibits expenditures from the Nuclear Waste Fund for research and development of activities on advanced nuclear fuel cycle technologies.American-Made Energy and Good Jobs Act - Requires the Secretary of the Interior to establish a competitive oil and gas leasing program that will result in environmentally sound exploration, development, and production of resources in the Coastal Plain, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), Alaska. Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 to repeal the prohibition of the production of oil and gas from ANWR. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to designate Special Areas within the Coastal Plain that may be excluded from leasing. Requires 50% of royalty revenues from leasing to be paid to Alaska. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) issue rights of way across the Coastal Plain for transportation of oil and gas; and (2) convey to the Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation and the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation specified estates.Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide financial assistance from the Coastal Plain Local Government Impact Aid Assistance Fund to eligible entities impacted by the exploration for, or production of, oil and gas on the Coastal Plain.Terminates the prohibition on: (1) leasing of federal submerged lands of the Outer Continental Shelf for the exploration, development, or production of oil or gas; (2) issuing federal permits for such exploration, development, or production; and (3) expending federal funds on such leases or permits.Requires federal agencies which received funds for conducting climate change basic research to use such funds only for climate change applied research."
