Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit from 30% to 50% of the cost of such a property placed in service by a taxpayer during the year. Allows a tax credit for conversion of gas and diesel propelled motor vehicles to vehicles propelled by alternative fuel, clean fuel, or fuel cells. Requires the Comptroller General of the United States to study and report to Congress on the refinery capacity of the United States."
