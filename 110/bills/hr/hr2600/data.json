Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) impose a tax on imports of goods and services from any country with an indirect tax system and deposits taxes so collected into a special account; and (2) upon request of a U.S. exporter, grant a rebate to such exporter from such account of indirect taxes paid. Imposes such requirements if the USTR fails to certify to Congress that U.S. objectives have been met."
