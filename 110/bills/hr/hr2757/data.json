Requires the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to designate the priority general public uses that will be authorized on such land and the first date on which each designated use will be allowed. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the funds provided pursuant to this Act should be used for preserving and increasing waterfowl populations in accordance with the goals and objectives of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan and should supplement and not replace current conservation funding; and (2) this Act should be implemented in a manner that helps private landowners achieve their long-term land use objectives in ways that enhance the conservation of wetlands and wildlife habitat."
