Allows the Commissioner of Social Security to charge a reasonable fee to the recipient as a condition for issuance of such a card. Provides that, in the computation of an individual's average indexed monthly earnings, or in certain circumstances an individual's average monthly wage, the individual shall not be credited with any wages paid, or any self-employment income derived, while such individual was not a U.S. citizen or national and was illegally in the United States. Requires issuance of special Social Security cards to adult illegal aliens. Prescribes criminal penalties for illegal aliens who do not possess such a Social Security card. Directs the Commissioner of Social Security to plan and implement a campaign to educate the people of the United States about the new Social Security cards provided for in this Act, and the requirement that illegal alien adults have such a card."
