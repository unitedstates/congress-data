Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security (the Secretary) to award Program grants through the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Provides that none of the provisions regarding grants to states and high-risk urban areas shall be construed to affect programs authorized under the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974, grants authorized under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, Emergency Management Performance Grants, grants to protect critical infrastructure (including port security grants), Metropolitan Medical Response System grants (authorized under the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006), the Interoperable Emergency Communications Grant Program, and grants not administered by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Directs the Administrator, in allocating funds among states and high-risk urban areas applying for grants under the Initiative or the Program, to consider that state's or area's relative threat, vulnerability, and consequences from terrorist acts and the anticipated effectiveness of the proposed use of the grant in increasing the ability of that state or area to prevent, prepare for, protect against, and respond to acts of terrorism, to meet its target capabilities, and to otherwise reduce the overall risk to the area, the state, or the nation. Permits grant awards to be used for a number of uses, including planning, training, exercises, protecting critical infrastructure, purchasing equipment, and paying personnel costs, in addition to any allowable use in the FY2007 grant guidance for the State Homeland Security Grant Program, the Urban Area Security Initiative, or the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program. Authorizes grant recipients to use up to 50% of their grant funds for personnel, including overtime and backfill costs. Permits state, local, and tribal governments to use grant funds in a manner that enhances preparedness for disasters unrelated to terrorist acts if such use assists them in achieving target capabilities related to terrorism. Sets forth provisions regarding reimbursement of costs.Places upon the Administrator responsibility for administering all DHS-administered homeland security grant programs and ensuring coordination and consistency.
