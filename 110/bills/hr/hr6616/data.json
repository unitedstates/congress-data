Requires the Secretary, if the study area meets the criteria for inclusion, to include it as a unit of the System. Provides for: (1) the consideration of an affiliation of the study area with the National Museum of the United States Army, the Buffalo Soldiers National Museum, or other entities associated with Colonel Charles Young in order to focus on his life and the African-American military experience; and (2) an investigation of the historical relationship of the Colonel Charles Young Home with the Underground Railroad."
