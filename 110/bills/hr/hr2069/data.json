Sets the amount of such tax at $10 per ton of the carbon content in such fuel. Defines \"taxable fuel\" as coal (including lignite and peat), petroleum and any petroleum product, and natural gas. Exempts from such tax the sale or in-kind exchange of fuel for deposit in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and certain exports or resales of such fuel."
