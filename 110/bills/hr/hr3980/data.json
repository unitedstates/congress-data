Requires that such aliens have access to legal orientation presentations through the Executive Office for Immigration Review's legal orientation program. States that detainees should be held within the jurisdiction of the local United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office to the extent that space allows. Requires a detainee's release within 72 hours of apprehension if such alien is not subject to mandatory detention, does not pose a flight risk, or is subject to humanitarian release. States that such alien shall be released: (1) on his or her own recognizance; (2) by posting a minimum bond; (3) on parole under the Immigration and Nationality Act; or (4) through the intensive supervision appearance or similar program."
