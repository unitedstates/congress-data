    "text": "Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 - Title I: Commodity Programs - (Sec. 1001) Defines specified terms. Subtitle A: Direct Payments and Counter-Cyclical Payments - (Sec. 1101) Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) to adjust base acres for covered commodities for a farm whenever: (1) a conservation reserve contract expires or is voluntarily terminated; (2) cropland is released from coverage under a conservation reserve contract; or (3) the producer has eligible pulse crop or oilseed acreage. Requires election of either direct payments and counter-cyclical payments or conservation payments if the base adjustment is made due to a change in status of a conservation reserve contract. Requires a reduction in base acres if the sum of base acres and other specified acreage exceeds the actual cropland acreage on the farm. Allows an owner to permanently reduce farm base acres at any time. Prohibits a producer from receiving direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, or average crop revenue election payments if a farm's base acreage is 10 acres or less unless the farm is owned by a socially disadvantaged or limited resource farmer or rancher. (Sec. 1102) Provides for the establishment of a payment yield for any designated oilseed or eligible pulse crop for direct payment and counter-cyclical payment purposes. (Sec. 1103) Establishes 2008-2012 payment rates as follows: (1) wheat, $0.52 per bushel; (2) corn, $0.28 per bushel; (3) grain sorghum, $0.35 per bushel; (4) barley, $0.24 per bushel; (5) oats, $0.024 per bushel; (6) upland cotton, $0.0667 per pound; (7) long grain rice, $2.35 per hundredweight; (8) medium grain rice, $2.35 per hundredweight; (9) soybeans, $0.44 per bushel; and (10) other oilseeds, $0.80 per hundredweight. Specifies a covered commodity's payment amount as the product of the payment rate, payment acres, and payment yield. Requires that direct payments shall be made not before October 1 of the calendar year in which the crop is harvested for each of the 2008-2012 crop years. Authorizes advance direct payments of up to 22% of the direct payments at the option of the producer for each of the 2008-2011 crop years. Requires repayment under certain circumstances. (Sec. 1104) Requires that counter-cyclical payments for covered commodities be made for each of the 2008-2012 crop years if the commodity's effective price is less than its target price. Sets forth effective price provisions for: (1) rice; and (2) other commodities. Establishes 2008 target prices as follows: (1) wheat, $3.92 per bushel; (2) corn, $2.63 per bushel; (3) grain sorghum, $2.57 per bushel; (4) barley, $2.24 per bushel; (5) oats, $1.44 per bushel; (6) upland cotton, $0.7125 per pound; (7) long grain rice, $10.50 per hundredweight; (8) medium grain rice, $10.50 per hundredweight; (9) soybeans, $5.80 per bushel; and (10) other oilseeds, $10.10 per hundredweight. Establishes 2009 target prices as follows: (1) wheat, $3.92 per bushel; (2) corn, $2.63 per bushel; (3) grain sorghum, $2.57 per bushel; (4) barley, $2.24 per bushel; (5) oats, $1.44 per bushel; (6) upland cotton, $0.7125 per pound; (7) long grain rice, $10.50 per hundredweight; (8) medium grain rice, $10.50 per hundredweight; (9) soybeans, $5.80 per bushel; (10) other oilseeds, $10.10 per hundredweight; (11) dry peas, $8.32 per hundredweight; (12) lentils, $12.81 per hundredweight; (13) small chickpeas, $10.36 per hundredweight; and (14) large chickpeas, $12.81 per hundredweight. Establishes 2010-2012 target prices as follows: (1) wheat, $4.17 per bushel; (2) corn, $2.63 per bushel; (3) grain sorghum, $2.63 per bushel; (4) barley, $2.63 per bushel; (5) oats, $1.79 per bushel; (6) upland cotton, $0.7125 per pound; (7) long grain rice, $10.50 per hundredweight; (8) medium grain rice, $10.50 per hundredweight; (9) soybeans, $6.00 per bushel; (10) other oilseeds, $12.68 per hundredweight; (11) dry peas, $8.32 per hundredweight; (12) lentils, $12.81 per hundredweight; (13) small chickpeas, $10.36 per hundredweight; and (14) large chickpeas, $12.81 per hundredweight. Specifies a covered commodity's counter-cyclical payment amount as the product of the payment rate, payment acres, and payment yield. Requires that payments be made beginning October 1, or as soon as practicable thereafter, after the end of the covered commodity's marketing year. Authorizes: (1) partial payments for the 2008-2010 crops of up to 40% of the projected counter-cyclical payment after completion of the first 180 days of the covered commodity's marketing year; and (2) producers to elect to receive partial payments at any time but not later than 60 days prior to the end of the marketing year. Requires repayment under certain circumstances. (Sec. 1105) Establishes as an alternative to receiving counter-cyclical payments the average crop revenue election (ACRE) program under which an electing covered commodity or peanut producer will forgo 20% of the direct payment rate and 30% of the marketing assistance loan rates for the 2009-2012 crop years in exchange for ACRE payments. Provides that: (1) ACRE participants will be eligible for state-based coverage with a revenue guarantee equal to 90% of the five-year state average yield per planted acre times the two-year national average price for a covered commodity; (2) the guarantee cannot vary by more than 10% from the previous year's guarantee; (3) if the actual state revenue is less than the revenue guarantee for a producer suffering a farm loss such producer will receive an ACRE payment equal to the difference between the revenue guarantee and the actual revenue of up to 25% of the revenue guarantee; and (4) ACRE payments shall be made on 83.3% of the acreage planted or considered planted for the 2009-2011 crop years, and on and 85% for crop year 2012. (Sec. 1106) Requires producer compliance with specified conservation-related requirements in order to qualify for direct, counter-cyclical, or ACRE payments. (Sec. 1107) Provides for base acre crop flexibility with limitations for trees, perennial plants, fruits, vegetables (other than mung beans and pulse crops), and wild rice in areas without planting histories of such crops. Directs the Secretary to carry out a pilot project for crop years 2009-2012 to permit the planting of cucumbers, green peas, lima beans, pumpkins, snap beans, sweet corn, and tomatoes in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. (Sec. 1108) Apportions long grain and medium grain rice counter-cyclical payment base acres on a specific time period. (Sec. 1109) States that this subtitle shall be effective for crop years 2008-2012. Subtitle B: Marketing Assistance Loans and Deficiency Payments - (Sec. 1201) Directs the Secretary to make nonrecourse marketing assistance loans available for crop years 2008-2012 for each loan commodity.
