Requires specified reporting procedures to provide for secure disclosure of Medicare data to Medicare Quality Reporting Organizations meeting certain requirements under contract with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Directs the Secretary to establish a Quality Advisory Board to: (1) coordinate existing collaborative efforts identifying quality and efficiency health care measures; (2) provide the Secretary with recommendations for development of model quality health care measures; (3) request Medicare Quality Reporting Organizations for reports on existing recommended model quality and efficiency health care measures; and (4) examine how clinical registries can be linked to Medicare data in order to develop reports on the quality and efficiency of service providers and suppliers. Directs the Secretary to permit researchers that meet existing criteria for appropriate release of Centers for Medicaid and Medicaid Services data to: (1) have access to all Medicare data; and (2) report on the performance of service providers and suppliers."
