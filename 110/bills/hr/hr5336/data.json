Includes among the criteria used to rank brownfield grant applications the extent to which the grant would implement green building standards, including the use of energy efficient building standards. Amends the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 to authorize grants to be made for the training and education of workers who are or may be engaged in activities related to: (1) brownfields site characterization, assessment, or remediation; or (2) emergency response, rescue, recovery, or cleanup in connection with a natural or intentional disaster. Authorizes funding for worker training and education grants for FY2008-FY2012."
