Provides that information submitted to the federal government to obtain, amend, or clarify a contract shall not be considered to be trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential, unless the information is proprietary information. Requires an agency to release requested information (unless shown to be exempt): (1) relating to whether a contractor performed the work required; (2) indicating the use of substandard materials or work practices; (3) relating to information that is discovered as part of a government investigation of a contract or that is revealed because of the existence of credible evidence raising doubts concerning the contractor's performance because of investigations for past poor performance or because the contractor has been the subject of credible and consistent press reports pertaining to performance of government contracts; or (4) if disclosure of the information will contribute to public understanding and knowledge.Requires any information released pursuant to this Act to relate solely to the federal contract involved and not to unrelated aspects of the company concerned."
