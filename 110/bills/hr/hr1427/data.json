(Sec. 103) Establishes the Federal Housing Enterprise Board to advise the Director. (Sec. 104) Instructs the Director to require a regulated entity to: (1) submit a timely report upon its discovery that it has purchased or sold a fraudulent loan or financial instrument, or if it suspects a possible fraud relating to a purchase or sale of any loan or financial instrument; (2) establish and maintain procedures designed to discover such transactions; and (3) report annually the total value of charitable contributions made to nonprofit organizations. (Sec. 106) Instructs the Director to establish and collect from the regulated entities annual assessments to provide for FHFA costs and expenses. (Sec. 107) Authorizes the Director to appoint accountants, economists, specialists in financial markets or information technology, and examiners with respect to supervision and regulation of the regulated entities.
