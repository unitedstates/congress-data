Requires the Secretary to establish the Public Health Workforce Loan Repayment Program to provide for the repayment of loans incurred by individuals in the pursuit of the relevant public health preparedness workforce educational degree or certificate in exchange for working at such agencies for at least three years. Requires the Secretary to award grants to public health agencies that receive public health preparedness cooperative agreements from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to operate state, local, and tribal public health workforce loan repayment programs. Authorizes the Secretary to provide for scholarships to enable mid-career professionals in the public health workforce to receive additional training in the field of public health preparedness or biodefense. Requires the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to ensure that included in the OPM website there is an online catalogue of public health workforce employment opportunities in the federal government.
