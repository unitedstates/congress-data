Increases rates of educational assistance: (1) under the Montgomery GI Bill; (2) for members of the Selected Reserve; and (3) for Selected Reserve members with extended (more than 12 years) service who provide support for contingency operations and other operations. Provides an annual stipend for individuals receiving basic educational assistance and pursuing a program of education at an approved institution of higher education. Allows a member who has completed six years of service (current law allows only members who have completed six years of service and have a military skill designated as critical) to transfer to one or more dependents any unused portion of the member's educational assistance entitlement. Provides similar authority for members of the Selected Reserve. Authorizes a member on active duty and entitled to basic educational assistance to use all or a portion thereof to repay any outstanding federal student loan. Makes eligible for educational assistance an individual who, after September 30, 2009, receives a commission upon graduation of a service academy or completion of Senior Reserve Officers' Training, and completes at least five years of continuous active duty. Makes eligible for enrollment under the Montgomery GI Bill certain retired personnel originally enrolled in the veterans' educational assistance program. Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a supplemental educational grant program under which a participating institution of higher education provides certain veterans with the non-federal share of a percentage of such veteran's unmet educational financial need."
