    "text": "Renewable Fuels, Consumer Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007 - Biofuels for Energy Security and Transportation Act of 2007 - Directs the President to: (1) promulgate regulations establishing a renewable fuel standard; and (2) provide a credit to the owner of any facility that uses renewable energy to displace over 90% of the fossil fuel normally used in renewable fuel production. Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish: (1) a competitive infrastructure pilot grant program for renewable fuels; (2) at least 11 bioresearch centers for systems biology; (3) grants for renewable fuel production research and development in certain states; (4) grants to Indian tribes and local governments for infrastructure for transportation of biomass to local biorefineries; and (5) a biorefinery information center. Authorizes loan guarantees for advanced biofuel projects. Directs the Secretary and the National Institute of Standards and Technology to establish jointly a public alternative fuel database and related standard reference materials. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to prescribe a fuel tank cap labeling requirement. Directs the President to promulgate a national biodiesel fuel quality standard. Requires transitional assistance payments to farmers who plant dedicated energy crops for a local cellulosic refinery. Directs the President to establish a grant program for research and development in support of low-carbon fuels. Requires the Secretary to study and report to Congress on: (1) advanced biofuels technologies; (2) increased consumption of ethanol-blended gasoline with higher levels of ethanol; (3) ethanol pipeline feasibility; (4) optimization of flexible fueled vehicles to use E-85 fuel; (5) credits for use of renewable electricity in electric vehicles; (6) engine durability associated with the use of biodiesel; (7) streamlined lifecycle analysis tools for the evaluation of renewable carbon content of biofuels; (8) the effects of ethanol-blended gasoline on off-road vehicles; and (9) offshore wind resources. Directs the President to study and report to Congress on incentives for renewable fuels. Directs the Secretary to establish a grant program for production of advanced biofuels. Amends the Clean Air Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to arrange with the National Academy of Sciences for two studies on the effects of increased domestic renewable fuel use. Requires the EPA Administrator to: (1) study whether the renewable fuel volumes required by this Act will adversely impact air quality as a result of changes in vehicle and engine emissions of regulated air pollutants; and (2) promulgate regulations to implement appropriate mitigation (anti-backsliding) measures. Energy Efficiency Promotion Act of 2007 - Directs the Secretary to take specified actions to: (1) promote advanced lighting technologies; (2) expedite new energy efficiency standards; (3) promote high efficiency vehicles and advanced batteries; (4) set energy efficiency goals; (5) promote federal leadership in energy efficiency and renewable energy; (6) assist state and local governments in energy efficiency; and (7) promote marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy.
