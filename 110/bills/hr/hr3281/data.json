Defines \"public provider\" as a state or a political subdivision or instrumentality thereof or any entity owned, controlled, or otherwise affiliated with a state, subdivision, or instrumentality. Prohibits a public provider from granting any regulatory preference to itself or to any provider it owns or is affiliated with. Requires, subject to exception, a public provider, before it provides advanced communications capability or services, to publish notice and provide local citizens and private-sector entities with an opportunity to be heard."
