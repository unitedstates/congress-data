Directs the Secretary of Defense, within 60 days after the enactment of this Act and every 90 days thereafter, to report to the congressional defense and appropriations committees on the status of planning for the redeployment of Armed Forces from Iraq. Requires the Secretary and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to brief such committees on matters contained in the reports. Terminates the reporting and briefing requirements on the date on which the Secretary certifies to such committees that the Armed Forces are no longer primarily engaged in a combat mission in Iraq."
