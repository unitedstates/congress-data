Allows the Secretary to waive specified non-federal matching fund requirements and to institute new ones, by regulation, based upon the level of economic distress of the local jurisdiction in which the local building code enforcement department seeking such grant is located. Sets forth criteria for rating and ranking of grant proposals. Authorizes appropriations for FY2009-FY2013."
