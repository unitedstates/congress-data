Requires the Secretary to make matching grants to public or nonprofit private entities to carry out demonstration projects for the purpose of forming and maintaining networks composed of health care specialists who volunteer health services to eligible individuals. Directs the Secretary to make an award of a grant or contract for the establishment and operation of a clearinghouse for information on demonstration projects under this Act and similar projects that are community initiated. Allows the Secretary to carry out a program to encourage public and private entities that plan or operate such projects to submit information to the clearinghouse."
