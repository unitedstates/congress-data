Requires the Secretary to award additional competitive grants to states or partnerships or consortia which include states for pilot programs that evaluate and promote the incorporation of instructional leadership standards into state principal certification or licensure. Directs the Secretary to establish a definition of \"highly-qualified principal\" that is based on reports from this Act's grantees and emphasizes instructional leadership standards."
