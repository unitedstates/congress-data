Requires a deferred prosecution agreement to be approved by a U.S. district court judge or a U.S. magistrate judge in the U.S. district court where criminal charges would be prosecuted by a U.S. attorney. Requires oversight of a deferred prosecution agreement by a federal monitor appointed by an independent third party (a U. S. district court judge or a U.S. magistrate judge) from a pool of pre-qualified firms or individuals (or both). Requires the presiding judge in the district court where a deferred prosecution agreement was approved, upon request by a U.S. Attorney, to determine if the deferred prosecution agreement has been breached."
