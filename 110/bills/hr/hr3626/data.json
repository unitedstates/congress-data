Confines the application of this Act to a hospital and an adjoining SNF that operated under common management before 1983 and closed during 2005, if before such closure the hospital was designated as a critical access hospital and the hospital and SNF both met the National Fire Protection Agency Life Health Safety Code as a facility existing as of March 16, 1982."
