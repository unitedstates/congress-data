Authorizes a consular official to issue a temporary tourist/business visa for a Cuban national (who is not otherwise inadmissible) whose itinerary documents an intent to conduct activities, including phytosanitary inspections, related to purchasing U.S. agricultural goods under the provisions of TSREEA of 2000. Defines \"payment in cash\" with respect to certain prohibitions on financing of U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba. Prohibits the President from restricting direct transfers from a Cuban financial institution to a U.S. financial institution executed in payment for a product authorized for sale under TSREEA of 2000."
