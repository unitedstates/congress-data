Expresses the sense of Congress that the optimal minimum period between such deployments should be equal to or longer than twice the period of the most recent previous deployment.Prohibits any unit of the reserves from being deployed for such Operation unless the period between the most recent previous deployment and a subsequent deployment is at least three times longer than the period of the most recent previous deployment. Expresses the sense of Congress that units of the reserves should not be mobilized continuously for more than one year, and that the optimal minimum period between such deployments should be five years.Provides exceptions from deployment requirements with respect to: (1) special operations forces; and (2) units needed to assist in the redeployment of members from Iraq to another operational requirement or back to their home stations.Authorizes the: (1) President to waive deployment requirements if the President certifies to Congress within 30 days that the deployment is necessary to meet U.S. national security interests; and (2) chief of staff of the military department concerned to waive such requirements with respect to a member who has voluntarily requested mobilization."
