    "text": "MEJA Expansion and Enforcement Act of 2007 - Provides that persons who, while employed under a federal agency contract in, or in close proximity to, an area where the Armed Forces are conducting a contingency operation, engage in conduct that would constitute an offense punishable by imprisonment for more than one year if engaged in within U.S. jurisdiction, shall be punished as provided for that offense.Requires the Inspector General of the Department of Justice (DOJ) to report to Congress on: (1) the status of DOJ's investigations of alleged violations committed by contract personnel; (2) findings and recommendations about the number of criminal cases prosecuted by DOJ involving such violations; and (3) with respect to covered contracts where the work is carried out in Iraq or Afghanistan, a list of each charge brought against contractors or contract personnel and a description of any legal actions taken by the United States as a result of such a criminal charge or a complaint.Requires the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to ensure that there are adequate personnel, through the creation of Theater Investigative Units, to investigate allegations of such criminal violations by contract personnel. Requires such a Unit to refer a case, if appropriate, to the Attorney General for further action. Requires the Director to request security assistance from the Secretary of Defense in any case in which a Unit does not have the resources or is otherwise unable to provide adequate security to ensure its safety. Authorizes the Attorney General to request assistance from the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or the head of any other agency, including the assignment of additional personnel and resources to a Unit.Requires the Director to report annually to Congress on the number of reports received by Units relating to suspected criminal misconduct by contractors or to fatalities resulting from the use of force by contractors, the number of cases referred by the Units to the Attorney General for further investigation or action, and any recommended changes to federal law that the Director considers necessary to perform the duties of the Director under this Act."
