Includes among grant application requirements assurances that facilities will be used for not less than 10 years for community-based mental health or substance abuse services for those who cannot pay for such services. Permits a grant recipient to request permission to transfer such 10-year obligation to another facility.Authorizes a state that receives a grant to award a subgrant to a qualified community program for activities such as: (1) the construction, expansion, and modernization of mental and behavioral health facilities; and (2) the construction and structural modification of facilities to permit the integrated delivery of behavioral health and primary care of specialty medical services to individuals with co-occurring mental illnesses and chronic medical or surgical diseases at a single service site.Requires a grant recipient to agree to make available nonfederal contributions matching federal funds provided."
