Requires such review to be completed within 90 days after the enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretaries, in developing the policy, to take into account specified findings, recommendations, and practices, including those of the Independent Review Group on Rehabilitative Care and Administrative Processes at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and National Naval Medical Center. Requires the policy developed to include: (1) mechanisms to ensure responsibility for recovering members in medical hold or holdover status or on the temporary disability retired list; (2) processes, procedures, and standards for medical evaluations and physical disability evaluations of recovering members; (3) standards for determinations of the return of recovering members to active duty; (4) standards for the transition of recovering members from care and treatment by DOD to care and treatment by the VA before, during, and after separation from service; (5) VA access to military health records of recovering members; and (6) surveys and other mechanisms to measure patient and family satisfaction with the DOD and VA provision of care and services. Requires a report from: (1) the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) to the congressional defense committees on instances when a disability rating assigned to a member by an informal physical evaluation board of DOD was reduced upon appeal, and the reasons for such reduction; (2) the Secretaries to the defense and veterans committees on the policy developed, as well as on policy updates; and (3) the Comptroller General (CG) annually to the defense and veterans committees assessing DOD and VA progress in developing and implementing the policy.

Authorizes such medical and dental care for three years beginning on the date: (1) of enactment of this Act, for those whose injury or illness was incurred on or after October 7, 2001, and before the enactment of this Act; and (2) on which the injury or illness is incurred, for those whose injury or illness occurs on or after the enactment of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to waive any limitation on the provision of such care if considered appropriate to assure the maximum feasible recovery and rehabilitation of the member or former member. Prohibits the Secretary from providing such medical and dental care after December 31, 2012, if the Secretary has not provided such care to such member or former member before that date. Entitles members with a severe injury or illness to rehabilitation and vocational benefits from the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Authorizes the Secretary of the military department concerned (Secretary concerned) to reimburse recovering members and former members with a severe injury or illness for certain expenses incurred in connection with the receipt of required medical care. (Sec. 122) Requires the Secretary to provide reimbursement for reasonable travel expenses for follow-on specialty care and related services of a former member who incurred a disability while on active duty in a combat zone or in combat-related operations, is entitled to retired or retainer pay, and requires follow-up care, services, or supplies at a specific military treatment facility located more than 100 miles away from the member's residence. Part II: Care and Services for Dependents - (Sec. 126) Makes a family member of a recovering member eligible for medical care at a military treatment facility if the family member is: (1) on invitational orders while caring for the member; (2) a non-medical attendee caring for the member; or (3) receiving per-diem payments from DOD while caring for the member. Makes a family member who is eligible for medical care under (1), above, for more than 45 days during a one-year period also eligible for job placement services offered by DOD. Requires a report from the Secretary to the defense committees on the need for additional employment services and job protection for family members who are placed on leave or displaced from employment while caring for a recovering member.

(Sec. 135) Authorizes appropriations to DOD for FY2008 for activities related to the improved diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of members with: (1) TBI; or (2) PTSD. (Sec. 136) Requires a report from the Secretary to the defense committees on progress in implementing requirements under the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 relating to: (1) a study on TBI incurred by members participating in Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom; (2) enhanced mental health screening and services for members; and (3) early diagnosis and treatment of PTSD and other mental health conditions of members.

Authorizes the Secretaries to carry out pilot projects of various technological approaches to the achievement of the joint record. Requires: (1) annual reports from the Office Director to the Secretaries and the defense and veterans committees on Office activities (to be made available to the public); and (2) semiannual reports, until joint record implementation, from the CG to the defense and veterans committees on DOD-VA progress in developing and implementing the joint record. Provides funding. (Sec. 142) Allows the Secretary to exercise any DOD authority for the appointment and pay of health care personnel in order to provide or enhance DOD capacity to provide care and treatment for members who are wounded or injured on active duty, and to support ongoing DOD patient care and medical readiness, education, and training requirements. Directs the military department Secretaries to: (1) develop a strategy of best practices for the recruitment of such medical and health professionals within their department; and (2) report on such strategy to the defense committees. (Sec. 143) Requires the Secretary to: (1) recommend to the defense committees legislative or administrative actions to address shortages in health care professionals within DOD; and (2) implement programs to recruit qualified individuals to serve as health care and mental health care personnel. Subtitle C: Disability Matters - Part I: Disability Evaluations - (Sec. 151) Authorizes the retirement or separation for disability of members on active duty for more than 30 days if the member has six months or more of active service and the disability was not noted at the time of the member's entrance into active duty, unless compelling medical evidence or judgment warrants a finding that the disability existed before the member's entrance into active duty. (Sec. 152) Requires the Secretary concerned, in making disability determinations, to: (1) utilize the schedule for rating disabilities in use by the VA; and (2) not deviate from such schedule. Authorizes the Secretary concerned to utilize criteria other than the VA schedule if the criteria will result in a determination of a greater percentage of disability than in the use of the schedule. (Sec. 153) Directs the Secretary to establish within DOD the Physical Disability Board of Review to review disability determinations made by DOD physical evaluation boards of members who, during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, and ending on December 31, 2009, are: (1) separated from the Armed Forces as unfit for duty due to a medical condition with a disability rating of 20% disabled or less; and (2) found to be ineligible for retirement.
