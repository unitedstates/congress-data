Requires such an individual to be permitted to cast a nonprovisional ballot in the election. Applies this requirement also with respect to an individual who resided in a household which was: (1) located in such a jurisdiction; and (2) subject to foreclosure proceedings at any time during the three-year period ending on the date of the election."
