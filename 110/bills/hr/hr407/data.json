Instructs the Secretary, in conducting the study, to analyze the potential impact that designation of the area as a national heritage area is likely to have on land within the proposed area or bordering such area that is privately owned. Requires the Secretary to submit to specified congressional committees a report describing the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the Secretary with respect to such study."
