Bars the United States from being held liable to any party (including the Tribe or any agent or instrumentality of the Tribe) for any term of, or any loss resulting from the term of any transfer, lease, encumbrance, or conveyance of land pursuant to this Act, except as specified. Makes such prohibition nonapplicable to land transferred or conveyed by the Tribe to the United States to be held in trust for the benefit of the Tribe."
