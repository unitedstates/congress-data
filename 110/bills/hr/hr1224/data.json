Requires physical education assessment to begin by school year 2009-2010, including measurement of students' proficiency at least one time during: (1) grades 3 through 6; (2) grades 6 through 9; and (3) grades 10 through 12. Directs the Secretary of Education to identify model state and local physical education programs, evaluate their safety and effectiveness, and publish information on such programs. Authorizes the Secretary to award competitive grants to states to: (1) establish or revise physical education standards; (2) develop assessment tools; (3) establish or revise physical education curricula to meet minimum content and performance standards established by the Secretary; and (4) support the development of model programs. Gives grant priority to high-need states. Requires non-federal matching contributions equal to 20% of the grant."
