Amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend, through 2012, the Qualified Zone Academy Bond program (which provides tax credits to the holders of such bonds, which in turn finance low or no interest loans for the improvement of public schools serving low-income areas). Requires public school rehabilitation, repair, or equipment financed through such bonds to serve the green goals of creating healthy learning environments while saving natural resources and money."
