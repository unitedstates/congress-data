(Currently the FTC, the federal banking agencies, and the National Credit Union Administration are jointly required to establish such guidelines and prescribe such regulations.) Directs the federal banking agencies and the National Credit Union Administration to establish guidelines and prescribe regulations within their respective jurisdictions that are the same or substantially similar to those prescribed by the FTC."
