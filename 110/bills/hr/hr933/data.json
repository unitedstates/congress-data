Marshals Service a Short Term State Witness Protection Section to provide protection for witnesses in state and local trials involving homicide or a serious violent felony or serious drug offense, pursuant to cooperative agreements with state and local district attorneys and the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. Directs the Section to give priority in awarding grants and providing services to prosecutor's offices in states with an average of at least 100 murders per year during the five-year period immediately preceding an application for protection. Authorizes: (1) the Attorney General to make grants to state and local district attorneys and to the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia for providing such witness protection; and (2) each recipient to use the grant to provide witness protection or to credit the grant to the Section to cover the Section's costs of providing witness protection. Permits grants to be awarded only in states with an average of not less than 100 murders per year during the most recent five-year period."
