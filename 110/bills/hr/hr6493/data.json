Authorizes appropriations.Directs the FAA Administrator to establish a process by which the FAA air transportation oversight system database is reviewed by a team of FAA employees on a monthly basis to ensure that: (1) any trends in regulatory compliance are identified; and (2) appropriate corrective actions are taken."
