    "text": "Higher Education Opportunity Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to revise and reauthorize HEA programs. Title I: General Provisions - (Sec. 101) Revises the general definition of an institution of higher education (IHE) to include schools that: (1) admit students whose secondary education was conducted in a home school setting; (2) award degrees (not necessarily bachelor's degrees) that are acceptable for admission to a graduate or professional degree program; and (3) enroll students who will be dually or concurrently enrolled in a secondary school. (Sec. 102) Revises the definition of an IHE for purposes of title IV student assistance programs. Requires graduate medical schools located outside the country, that qualified to participate in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program owing to their having a state-approved clinical training program as of January 1, 1992, to have continuously operated a clinical training program in at least one state that is approved by such state. Allows foreign nursing schools to participate in the FFEL program if : (1) they have agreements with hospitals or nursing schools located in this country that require students to complete their training at such hospitals and schools, and such schools to provide graduates with their degrees; (2) they certify only subsidized Stafford loans and unsubsidized Stafford loans and PLUS loans under the FFEL program; (3) they agree to reimburse the Secretary of Education (Secretary) for the cost of any student loan defaults included in their cohort default rates; and (4) at least 75% of their students or graduates who take the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses pass such exam. Directs the advisory panel of medical experts to report to the Secretary and Congress, within one year of this Act's enactment, its recommendations for alternate eligibility requirements allowing foreign graduate medical schools with a clinical training program approved by a state before 2008 to participate in the FFEL program. Authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations establishing such alternate eligibility criteria. Raises from 60% to 75% the pass rate required of foreign graduate medical schools on examinations administered by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates if such schools are to participate in the FFEL program. Includes as proprietary IHEs any schools offering baccalaureate degrees in liberal arts and schools that enroll students who will be dually or concurrently enrolled in a secondary school. Includes as postsecondary vocational institutions any schools that enroll students who will be dually or concurrently enrolled in a secondary school. (Sec. 103) Adds definitions of critical foreign language, distance education, diploma mill, early childhood education program, poverty line, universal design, and universal design for learning. (Sec. 104) Elaborates on the current sense of Congress regarding the speech and association rights of students in higher education to specify that such students should not be intimidated, harassed, discouraged from speaking out, or discriminated against. (Sec. 106) Reconstitutes the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity in the Department of Education (Department) to advise the Secretary on accreditation matters until October 2014. (Sec. 107) Requires biennial IHE reviews of their alcohol and drug abuse prevention programs to include a determination as to: (1) the number of drug- and alcohol-related violations and fatalities occurring on the campus or as part of their activities that are reported to campus officials; and (2) the number and type of sanctions the IHEs impose on students or employees as a result of such violations or fatalities. Repeals the National Recognition Awards for outstanding IHE alcohol and drug abuse prevention programs. Reauthorizes appropriations for alcohol and drug abuse prevention grants for FY2009-FY2014. (Sec. 108) Extends an authorization of appropriations to continue coverage of prior rights and obligations for servicing outstanding bonds from certain earlier programs under title VII of the HEA before it was amended by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 and the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. (Sec. 109) Directs the Secretary to place information on the Department's website to assist students, families, and employers in understanding what diploma mills are and how to identify and avoid them. (Sec. 110) Directs the Secretary to display a link to the Department's student financial aid website in a prominent place on the homepage of the Department's website. Requires the Secretary to provide access, via the Department's student financial aid website, to: (1) information concerning student financial aid options provided by other federal departments and agencies; (2) an Armed Forces information website, to be created by the Secretary, providing information about all federal and state student financial aid available to members and veterans of the Armed Forces and their families; and (3) a National Database on Financial Assistance for the Study of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, which is also to be created by the Secretary. Prohibits charging user fees for use of the Department's financial aid websites. (Sec. 111) Directs the Secretary to place on the College Navigator website each year lists of the: (1) 5% of IHEs that have the highest tuition and fees for the most recent year; (2) 5% of IHEs that have the highest net price (price minus student aid) for the most recent year; (3) 5% of IHEs that have the largest percentage increase in tuition and fees over the most recent three years; (4) 5% of IHEs that have the largest percentage increase in net price over the most recent three years; (5) 10% of IHEs that have the lowest tuition and fees for the most recent year; and (6) 10% of IHEs that have the lowest net price for the most recent year. Requires IHEs on the lists for the largest percentage increases in tuition and fees or net price over the most recent three years to issue reports to the Secretary explaining such increases, the steps they will take toward reducing costs, and the extent to which their state governments are responsible for such cost increases. Requires the Secretary to summarize such reports in a report to be provided to Congress and placed on the College Navigator website. Requires the Secretary to report annually on the College Navigator website comparisons for each state of percentage changes over the most recent five years in: (1) state spending per full-time student in public IHEs; (2) the tuition and fees such students have been charged over the most recent five years; and (3) the total amount of state need- and merit-based aid provided to such students. Requires the Secretary to develop, and IHEs to make available on their websites, a net price calculator that allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate a IHE's net price for individual students. Requires the Secretary to post on the College Navigator website: (1) additional basic information about each IHE's students, teachers, assistance, costs, safety, services, and credit transfer policies; and (2) a link to the section of the Bureau of Labor Statistics website that provides regional data on starting salaries in all major occupations. Directs the Commissioner of Education Statistics to continue to update and improve the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, including the reporting of information by institutions and the timeliness of the data collected. Requires the Secretary to develop, and make available on the College Navigator website, a multi-year tuition calculator to help current and prospective students, their families, and other consumers estimate the amount of tuition an individual may pay to attend an IHE in future years and compare such estimate with those for other schools. Directs the Secretary to conduct a survey of title IV student aid recipients on a state-by-state basis at least once every four years. (Sec. 112) Requires publishers informing teachers or those selecting course materials at IHEs about available textbooks or supplements to include written information concerning: (1) the price the publisher would charge for such items to the bookstore associated with such institution and, if available, the price the publisher charges the public; (2) the copyright dates of the three previous editions of such textbooks; (3) substantial revisions to such items; and (4) whether such items are available in other formats, including paperback and unbound, and the price the publisher would charge the bookstore and, if available, the price the publisher charges the public, for items in those formats. Requires a publisher that sells a textbook and any accompanying supplement as a single bundled item also to sell them as separately priced and unbundled items. Directs IHEs to include on their Internet course schedules the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) and retail price for each required or recommended textbook or supplement for listed courses. Requires an institution to: (1) use the author, title, publisher, and copyright date if the ISBN is unavailable; and (2) indicate that the required information has yet to be determined if its disclosure for a course is impractical. Requires IHEs to provide college bookstores, upon request, with: (1) their course schedules for the subsequent academic period; (2) the information this Act requires to be placed on Internet course schedules regarding each textbook or supplement required or recommended for each course; and (3) the number of students enrolled, and the maximum enrollment, in each course. Encourages IHEs to inform students of ways to save money on course materials. Directs the Comptroller General to report to Congress on the implementation of these requirements by IHEs, college bookstores, and publishers. (Sec. 113) Prohibits the creation or maintenance of a federal database of personally identifiable student information. States that such prohibition does not apply to certain data systems in use before this Act's enactment, or state databases that track individuals over time. (Sec. 114) Prohibits a state from charging more than the instate tuition for attending a public IHE in that state to: (1) members of the Armed Forces who are on active duty for more than 30 days and whose domicile or permanent duty station is in such state; or (2) such members' dependents. Provides that, even if such members' permanent duty station is subsequently changed to a location outside the state, they or their dependents must continue to be charged no more than the instate tuition if they remain continuously enrolled at such IHE in the state. (Sec. 115) Establishes a State Higher Education Information System Pilot program under which the Secretary shall award competitive grants to up to five states, consortia of states, or consortia of IHEs to: (1) design, test, and implement state-level postsecondary student data systems that provide the maximum benefits to states, IHEs, and state policymakers; and (2) examine the costs and burdens involved in implementing such systems. (Sec. 116) Requires states to maintain or increase their funding of non-capital and indirect research and development costs at public IHEs and their funding of financial aid at private IHEs or become ineligible for this Act's new grants to expand college access and increase college persistence under the College Access Challenge Grant program. Allows the Secretary to waive such requirement for states facing exceptional circumstances. (Sec. 117) Revises requirements for: (1) the performance-based organization for delivery of federal student financial assistance; and (2) procurement flexibility. (Sec 119) Prohibits IHEs from using federal HEA funds to lobby for federal contracts, grants, loans, cooperative agreements, or earmarks. (Sec. 120) Creates a new part E (Lender and Institution Requirements Related to Educational Loans) under title I of the HEA. Directs the Secretary, within 18 months of this Act's enactment, to determine the minimum information that lenders, IHEs, and IHE affiliates participating in preferred lender arrangements must provide regarding FFELs offered to students and their families. Includes within such minimum information certain information required under the Truth in Lending Act. Requires the Secretary to develop a model disclosure form that preferred lenders, IHEs, and IHE affiliates may use. Requires IHEs and their affiliates that participate in preferred lender arrangements to include on their websites and financial aid informational materials: (1) the minimum FFEL information required by the Secretary; (2) the maximum amount of student aid available under title IV of the HEA; (3) a statement that the IHE is required to process FFEL documents received from any eligible lender the student selects; and (4) with respect to private education loans, certain information required under the Truth in Lending Act. Requires lenders in preferred lender arrangements annually to provide participating IHEs, IHE affiliates, and the Secretary with the minimum FFEL information required by the Secretary for each type of FFEL such lender plans to offer for the next award year.
