    "text": "Energy for America Act - Produced Water Utilization Act of 2007 - Requires the Secretary of Energy to conduct a program of research, development, and demonstration of technologies for environmentally sustainable utilization of produced water for agriculture, irrigation, municipal, industrial uses, or other environmentally sustainable purposes Requires the program to address: (1) produced water recovery, including research for desalination and demineralization; (2) reinjection of produced water into subsurface geological formations; and (3) safety and environmental impacts of such activities. Biomass Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 2007 - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to include specified advanced biofuel technologies within the bioenergy program. Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle Act of 2007 - Instructs the Secretary to conduct a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application on technologies for the development of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Energy Storage Solutions for America Act of 2007 - Directs the Secretary to: (1) carry out a research, development, and demonstration program to support the ability of the United States to remain globally competitive in energy storage systems for electricity transmission and distribution; and (2) establish an Energy Storage Advisory Council. Energy Efficient Buildings Act of 2007 - Directs the Secretary to establish a pilot program to award grants to businesses and organizations for new construction of energy efficient buildings, or major renovations of buildings that will result in energy efficient buildings, to demonstrate innovative energy efficiency technologies, especially those sponsored by the Department of Energy (DOE). Prescribes criteria for mandatory consideration by the Secretary when identifying for support \"ARPA-E\" projects (that show promise to accelerate efforts to overcome barriers to development of advanced energy technologies). Green Energy Education Act of 2007 - Authorizes the Secretary to contribute funds to the National Science Foundation for the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship program to support projects that enable graduate education related to DOE research,demonstration, and commercial application activities, especially those related to high performance buildings. Instructs the Secretary to transmit to Congress the results of a feasibility study of large-scale biological sequestration of carbon dioxide for coal power systems, including the feasibility of creating a closed loop carbon cycle through biological sequestration."
