Requires the election to be in the form of a bill approved by the state legislature and signed by the governor that contains specified requirements, including that: (1) up to 50% of the annual harvest of timber in state timber management areas be offered as 10-year contracts and that timber sales meet the needs of all existing wood processing operations on the Tongass National Forest; and (2) specified state receipts be deposited into an account for state kindergarten and grade school education. Sets forth provisions governing the exchange-transition period and the post-transition period, including requiring that, in the post-transition period, conveyed portions of the Tongass National Forest shall be administered and managed primarily for timber production as state timber management areas."
