    "text": "FHA Housing Stabilization and Homeownership Retention Act of 2008 - Title I: Homeownership Retention - (Sec. 102) Amends the National Housing Act (NHA) to create the Refinance Program Oversight Board, which shall establish and oversee a program for insuring homeownership retention mortgages. Instructs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to insure any homeownership retention mortgage covering a one- to four-family residence made to pay or prepay outstanding obligations under an existing mortgage on the residence. Sets forth mortgagor eligibility criteria, including mortgagor certification that: (1) the residence is the only residence in which the mortgagor has any present ownership interest; (2) the mortgagor has not intentionally defaulted on the existing mortgage, nor knowingly, willfully, and with actual knowledge furnished material information known to be false for the purpose of obtaining the existing mortgage. Requires waiver or forgiveness of all: (1) prepayment penalties; and (2) fees and penalties related to default or delinquency on existing mortgages. Sets forth terms for required: (1) reduction of indebtedness under an existing senior mortgage; (2) extinguishment of debt by refinancing; and (3) treatment of multiple mortgage liens. Requires debt service payments due under a mortgage insured under this Act to be substantially reduced from the debt service payments due under the existing mortgage or mortgages. Requires the mortgage to provide that the HUD Secretary retain a lien on the residence which shall: (1) be subordinate to the mortgage insured under this Act, but senior to all other existing mortgages on it; and (2) secure the repayment. Instructs the Oversight Board to prohibit borrowers from granting a new second lien on the mortgaged property during the first five years the mortgage is insured under this Act. Requires the mortgagee to document and verify mortgagor income.
