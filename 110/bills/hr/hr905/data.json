States that this Act is not intended to result in the creation of new programs or taxes. Requires the Commission to limit: (1) its activities to reviewing programs or tax laws as of the enactment of this Act with the goal of ensuring fairness and equity in its operation and application; and (2) its recommendations to the termination or reduction of payments, benefits, services, or tax advantages, rather than the termination of federal agencies or departments."
