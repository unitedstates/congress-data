    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "2008-06-05", 
    "text": "National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2008 - (Sec. 2) Revises the 21st Century Nanotechology Research and Development Act with regard to strategic plans developed pursuant to the National Nanotechnology Program (the Program). Modifies annual reporting requirements with regard to the Program. Requires agencies participating in the Program to support the activities of committees involved in the setting of standards for nanotechnology. Allows such agencies to reimburse the travel costs of scientists and engineers who participate in the activities of such committees. Revises requirements with respect to the National Nanotechnology Coordination Office. Requires the Office to be supported by funds from each agency participating in the Program. Sets forth annual reporting requirements regarding the Office. Requires the National Nanotechnology Coordination Office to: (1) develop a database that provides information to the public concerning projects funded under the Environmental, Health, and Safety, the Education and Societal Dimensions, and the Nanomanufacturing program component areas, or any successor areas; and (2) develop and publicize information on nanotechnology facilities supported under the Program, which may include information on nanotechnology facilities supported by the states, that are accessible for use from academic institutions and industry. Makes the National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel a distinct entity. Instructs the Panel to form a subpanel to enable it in assessing whether societal, ethical, legal, environmental, and workforce concerns are adequately addressed by the Program. Requires that at least one member of the Advisory Panel be an individual employed by and representing a minority-serving institution. Rewrites provisions for triennial external review of the Program. Authorizes appropriations for FY2009-FY2010 for such reviews from the amounts provided by participating agencies supporting the National Nanotechnology Coordination Office. Modifies the definition of nanotechnology. Defines \"nanoscale.\" (Sec. 3) Requires the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to designate an associate director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy as the Coordinator for Societal Dimensions of Nanotechnology. Makes the Coordinator responsible for oversight of the coordination, planning, and budget prioritization of activities required by the Program to ensure that the ethical, legal, environmental, and other appropriate societal concerns are considered during the development of nanotechnology. Specifies that the Coordinator's responsibilities include: (1) ensuring that the research plan for the environmental, health, and safety research activities as described in this Act is developed, updated, and implemented and that such plan is responsive to the recommendations of the subpanel of the Advisory Panel; (2) encouraging and monitoring the efforts of participating agencies to allocate resources and management necessary to ensure that such societal concerns related to nanotechnology, including human health concerns, are addressed; and (3) encouraging the agencies required to develop the research plan to identify, assess, and implement mechanisms for the establishment of public-private partnerships for support of environmental, health, and safety research. Requires the Coordinator to convene a panel to develop a research plan for the Environmental, Health, and Safety program component area. Instructs such panel, in developing and updating the plan, to solicit and be responsive to recommendations and advice from the subpanel of the Advisory Panel and the agencies responsible for environmental, health, and safety regulations associated with the production, use, and disposal of nanoscale materials and products.
