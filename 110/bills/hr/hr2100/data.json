    "text": "Equal Opportunity Protection and Civil Rights Restoration Act of 2007 - Prohibits discrimination or preferences in federal employment and contracting and other federal programs and activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, or sex. Prohibits requiring or encouraging any federal contractor or subcontractor to so discriminate or grant a preference. Prohibits states and private entities that receive federal financial assistance from so discriminating or granting a preference in connection with any contract or subcontract, employment, or admission to any educational institution. Prohibits construing this Act to prohibit or limit: (1) any act designed to benefit historically Black colleges or universities; or (2) any action under a federal law or treaty relating to the Indian tribes. Declares that this Act does not prohibit or limit employment classifications based on sex if sex is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to normal operation or the classification is applied regarding an armed forces member. Allows any aggrieved person to obtain, in a civil action, appropriate relief (including back pay) from the violator, including from a government entity. Requires awarding a prevailing plaintiff attorney's fees as part of the costs."
