Prohibits U.S. nonhumanitarian assistance to the government of Vietnam for subsequent fiscal years in excess of FY2007 levels unless the President certifies to Congress that in addition to such requirements: (1) no government of Vietnam official, agency, or entity wholly or partly owned by the government of Vietnam was complicit in a severe form of trafficking in persons; or (2) the government of Vietnam took all appropriate steps to end any such complicity and hold any official, agency, or entity accountable for such conduct. Authorizes the President to waive such prohibition for reasons of national interest. Title II: Assistance to Support Democracy in Vietnam - (Sec. 201) Authorizes the President to provide assistance through nongovernmental organizations and the Human Rights Defenders Fund for the support of individuals and organizations to promote human rights in Vietnam.
