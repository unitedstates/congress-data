Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to enter into contracts and agreements with non-federal entities to conduct authorized hazardous fuel reduction projects and other projects that are proposed to be conducted on federal land that is within not more than 1 1/2 miles of non-federal land owned by the non-federal entity or that is covered by community wildfire protection plans that also cover such non-federal land when: (1) the conditions on the federal land, such as the risk of wildfire, an insect or disease epidemic, or the presence of invasive species, pose a risk to the adjacent federal land; (2) the contract or agreement is in the government's and landowner's interest and will promote the goals of this Act; and (3) the project is consistent with the resource management plan."
