Grants the Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office authority to: (1) waive statutory provisions governing the filing, processing, renewal, and maintenance of patents, trademark registrations, and patent and trademark applications in certain emergencies; and (2) accept late application filings for patent extensions in certain cases of unintentional delay. Prescribes filing fees for patent extensions, including: (1) $65 million for an anticoagulant drug intended for use in humans; and (2) a formula for other items."
