(Sec. 308) Requires (under current law, permits) the Administrator to award grants for the establishment of university-based Centers for Research on Aviation Training. Title IV: Exploration Initiative - (Sec. 401) Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should invite America's friends and allies to participate in an international initiative under the leadership of the United States to expand human and robotic presence into the solar system, including the exploration and utilization of the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, Lagrangian points, and eventually Mars and its moons. (Sec. 402) Affirms Congress's support for the goals of the space exploration policy of the United States, including the eventual return to and exploration of the Moon and other destinations in the solar system and the national imperative of independent access to space. (Sec. 403) Instructs the Administrator, in order to maximize the cost-effectiveness of the U.S.'s long-term exploration and utilization activities, to ensure that activities in NASA's lunar exploration program be designed and implemented in a manner that gives strong consideration as to how those activities might also help meet the requirements of future exploration and utilization activities beyond the Moon. Requires: (1) the timetable of the lunar phase of the international exploration initiative to be determined by the availability of funding; and (2) once an exploration-related project enters its development phase, the Administrator to seek to complete that project without undue delays. (Sec. 404) Prohibits NASA, as it works toward establishing a lunar outpost, from making any plans that would require an outpost to be occupied to maintain its viability. Requires any such outpost to be operable as a human-tended facility capable of remote or autonomous operation for extended periods.Designates the U.S. portion of the first human-tended outpost established on the surface of the Moon as the \"Neil A. Armstrong Lunar Outpost.\"Expresses the sense of Congress that NASA should make use of commercial services in support of its lunar outpost activities. (Sec. 405) Requires the establishment of an exploration technology research and development program that is not tied to specific flight projects and that shall have the funding goal of ensuring that the technology research and development can be completed in a timely manner to support the safe, successful, and sustainable exploration of the solar system.
