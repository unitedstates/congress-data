Requires the Administrator to: (1) establish guidelines to ensure the quality, comparability, and scope of state energy data required to provide a comprehensive, accurate energy profile; (2) share company-level data collected at the state level with the state involved, provided it has agreed to the Administrator's guidelines; (3) assess any existing gaps in data compiled by the Energy Information Administration; and (4) evaluate the most cost effective ways to address any data quality and quantity issues in conjunction with state officials.
