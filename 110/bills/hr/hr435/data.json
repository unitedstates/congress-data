Requires the Secretary to award a contract under which the contractor shall: (1) compare royalty payments made under federal oil and gas lease provisions for covered lands against data supplied to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; (2) make such comparison retroactive to June 1, 1974; (3) determine whether the correct production standard volume and heating content analysis was used to calculate such payments; and (4) determine whether such payments were adequate under the terms of the oil and gas leases."
