    "text": "Responsibly Ending Authority to Purchase Act of 2008 or the REAP Act of 2008 - Terminates the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to establish the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA). Amends the EESA to convert the program to guarantee troubled assets into a program to guarantee troubled mortgage-backed securities. Terminates such program on December 31, 2009. Renames the Troubled Assets Insurance Financing Fund the Troubled Mortgage-Backed Securities Insurance Financing Fund. Defines troubled mortgage-backed securities as a residential or commercial mortgage or any instrument originated or issued on or before March 14, 2008, that is based upon or related to such mortgage. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a deduction for between 85% and 100% of dividends received from controlled foreign corporations by certain corporations which are U.S. shareholders. Requires such deduction to be invested in the United States pursuant to a specified domestic reinvestment plan, including as a source for the funding of worker hiring and training, infrastructure, research and development, capital investments, or the financial stabilization of the corporation for the purposes of job retention or creation. States that such reinvestment requirements shall be met if amounts repatriated are invested in distressed debt for at least one year."
