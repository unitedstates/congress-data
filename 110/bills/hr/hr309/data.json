    "text": "Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, to carry out a demonstration program that provides that receipts from timber sales shall be retained for expenditure within units of the National Park System from which the timber is removed as part of an approved plan for the restoration or protection of park resources or values. Instructs the Secretary to permit each of the existing 24 National Battlefields, National Battlefield Parks, National Military Parks, and National Battlefield Sites to participate in the demonstration program if the unit has in place a general management plan, cultural landscape plan, or other resources management plan approved pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 that identifies specific timber for removal for purposes of cultural or historic landscape restoration or fuel load reduction. Requires each unit selected to participate in the demonstration program to retain receipts from the sale or disposal of timber removed. Provides for such receipts to be available for expenditure for within a unit for the following purposes only: (1) landscape restoration; (2) interpretive services; (3) eradication of disease, insects, or invasive species; or (4) fuel load reduction. Requires the Secretary to submit a report containing the results of such demonstration program, including: (1) a detailed accounting of the receipts generated in each unit by such program; (2) the expenditure by each unit of those receipts; and (3) any resource or other impacts, positive or negative, on each participating unit. Terminates the authority granted to the Secretary to carry out the demonstration program under this Act four years after enactment of this Act."
