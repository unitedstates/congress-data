Makes it out of order for any fiscal year in which there is no budget surplus to consider any such measure that carries an earmark. Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), by March 1 of each calendar year, to prepare, and submit to the congressional budget committees, an estimate of the surplus or deficit for the next fiscal year."
