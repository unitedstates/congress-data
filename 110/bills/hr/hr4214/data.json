Directs the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to: (1) consult best practices guidelines in evaluating hospitals' infection control plans as a condition of participation in the Medicare program; and (2) report to Congress on the feasibility of reducing healthcare-associated infection rates through a Quality Improvement Payment Program. Requires: (1) hospitals to report information about community and healthcare-associated infections to the CDC National Healthcare Safety Network, which shall be used by the CDC to develop a national database of infection rates in hospitals; (2) the Director of the CDC to award grants to states to carry out public awareness campaigns; (3) the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to expand and intensify NIH programs regarding research and related activities concerning such infections; (4) the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish an interagency working group on community and healthcare-associated infections; and (5) the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to report to Congress on this Act's impact."
