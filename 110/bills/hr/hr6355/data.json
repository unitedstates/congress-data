Requires certain air carriers and hub airport operators to submit for the Secretary's approval emergency contingency plans for flight delays. Requires the Secretary to establish a consumer complaints hotline telephone number. Prohibits flight ticket sales on aircraft on which a insecticide has been applied within the last 60 days or on which an insecticide is planned to be used in the aircraft while passengers are on board, unless passengers are informed before buying a ticket. Requires the Inspector General of DOT to review air carrier flight delays, cancellations, and associated causes to update its 2000 report on such matters. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on European Union rules for passenger rights. Establishes an advisory committee for aviation consumer protection. Sets forth requirements regarding: (1) denied boarding compensation; and (2) expansion of DOT airline consumer complaint investigations. Prescribes requirements for mediation of disputes between the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and its employees in attempting to reach an agreement concerning the implementation of proposed changes to the FAA personnel management system."
