    "text": "Western Hemisphere Counterterrorism and Nonproliferation Act of 2008 - States that, in order to enhance the security of the Western Hemisphere and bolster regional capacity to counter terrorism, it shall be U.S. policy to promote the signing, ratification, and implementation by all countries in the Western Hemisphere of specified counter terrorism conventions. Amends specified acts with respect to annual country reports on terrorism, as well reports on narcotics trafficking, money laundering, and law enforcement. Authorizes the President to impose specified sanctions on any country in the Western Hemisphere that the President has determined is engaged in state sponsored terrorism, is carrying out policies that threaten U.S. national security interests, or is not fully cooperating with U.S. counterterrorism or nonproliferation efforts. Expresses the sense of Congress that the International Law Enforcement Academy in San Salvador, El Salvador, should continue to serve as a critical component of United States regional counterterrorism efforts. Redirects 50% of the U.S. contribution to the Organization of American States (OAS) to the OAS Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism, the OAS Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission, and the Western Hemisphere Regional Coordination Centers. Directs the Secretary of State to negotiate the establishment of: (1) Western Hemisphere Regional Coordination Centers; and (2) the Western Hemisphere Nonproliferation Partnership Initiative. States U.S. policy with respect to the prevention of the proliferation of weapons-related nuclear, chemical, and biological materials, technology, and facilities, as well as policy with respect to nuclear fuel fabrication and provides specified directives and sanctions. Places restrictions on nuclear cooperation with countries assisting the nuclear program of Venezuela or Cuba. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Latin America Regional Strategic Initiative should serve as a critical component of U.S. regional counterterrorism and nonproliferation efforts."
