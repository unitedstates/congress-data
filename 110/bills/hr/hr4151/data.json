Requires that such a campaign be designed to: (1) enhance the image of education and professions in the STEM fields and promote participation in such fields; (2) hold as a high priority making specific appeals to Latinos, Native Americans, African-Americans, and women in order to increase their numbers in STEM fields; and (3) include a narrowly focused effort to attract current professionals in STEM fields into teaching in elementary and secondary schools."
