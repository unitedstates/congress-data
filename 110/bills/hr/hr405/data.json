Requires that such treatment programs be accessible to pregnant and parenting women in health disparity populations. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to expand, intensify, and coordinate efforts to provide treatment for methamphetamine addiction to pregnant and parenting women.Requires the Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, to award grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts for to assist local jails and detention facilities in providing comprehensive, family-based substance abuse treatment services to pregnant and parenting adults who are considered nonviolent offenders. Sets forth criteria that must be met if such a grant is used for a family drug treatment program that is an alternative to incarceration.Gives priority in awarding grants under this Act to any entity that agrees to use the award for programs serving an area that: (1) is a rural area, an area with a shortage of mental health professionals, or an area with a shortage of family-based substance abuse treatment options; and (2) has high rates of addiction to methamphetamine or other drugs."
