Authorizes the Secretary to require states to implement such a system if feasible and cost-effective.Requires withholding of federal matching payments to states for: (1) failure to implement an asset verification program; and (2) any expenditures other than for compensation of a state employee or payment to a state entity (for instance, expenditures for consultants).Requires states to submit to the Secretary state plan amendments for creating Internet-based transparency programs to improve public disclosure of Medicaid payments information.Amends SSA title XI to permit limitations, restrictions, and suspensions of Medicaid eligibility in cases of Medicaid-related civil or criminal fraud or abuse.Provides for an extended period of one year to recover Medicaid overpayments resulting from fraud or abuse."
