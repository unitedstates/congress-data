Defines a \"highly rural veteran\" as one who: (1) resides more than 60 miles from the nearest VA facility providing primary care services, more than 120 miles from a VA facility providing acute hospital care, or more than 240 miles from a VA facility providing tertiary care (depending on which services the veteran needs); or (2) otherwise experiences such hardships or other difficulties in travel to the nearest appropriate VA facility that such travel is not in the best interest of the veteran. Requires an annual program assessment report, during the three-year period, from the Secretary to the congressional veterans' committees, which shall include recommendations for continuing the program."
