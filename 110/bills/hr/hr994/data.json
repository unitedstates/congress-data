Requires that such Independent Safety Assessment be: (1) conducted by an Independent Safety Assessment Team; (2) monitored by an Independent Safety Assessment Observation Group and by an Independent Safety Assessment Citizens' Review Team; and (3) equal in scope, depth, and breadth to the Independent Safety Assessment of the Maine Yankee Nuclear Power Plant, located near Bath, Maine, conducted by the NRC in 1996. Prescribes conditions for a final NRC decision to renew the operating licenses for Units 2 and 3 at the Center."
