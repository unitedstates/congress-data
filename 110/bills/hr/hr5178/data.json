Directs the Attorney General to: (1) award grants to states to establish programs to identify juveniles likely to be released before attaining age 25 and to help such juveniles attain self-sufficiency; (2) develop outcome measures to assess the performance of states in operating juvenile offender reentry programs and track services provided to such offenders; and (3) conduct evaluations of state juvenile offender reentry programs. Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to continue health care benefits for juvenile offenders after release from incarceration."
