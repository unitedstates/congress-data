Requires such contract to provide for re-enrichment at the Paducah facility of the materials in the cylinders and in similar cylinders of comparable value. Requires the Secretary to sell or contract for the sale of the product of such re-enrichment, whose net proceeds shall be deposited into the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund (UEDD Fund) and disbursed by appropriation for environmental remediation at the Paducah, Kentucky, and Portsmouth, Ohio, uranium enrichment facilities. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to reauthorize the UEDD Fund for an additional three years."
