    "text": "Mobile Home Protection Act - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 (section 8 voucher program) to require a public housing agency (PHA) to contract to make section 8 rental assistance payments directly to a family (rather than to the owner of the real property on which the family's manufactured (mobile) home is located) only in the case of a low-income family that owns a manufactured home, rents the real property on which it is located, and to whom assistance under such Act has been made available. Sets as conditions for such a direct payment contract that: (1) the owner of the real property refuses to enter into a contract to receive assistance payments; (2) the family was residing in the manufactured home on the real property at the time such assistance was initially made available on the family's behalf; (3) the family provides assurances to the agency that amounts from the assistance payments are used for rental of the real property; and (4) such rental otherwise complies with the Act's requirements for assistance."
