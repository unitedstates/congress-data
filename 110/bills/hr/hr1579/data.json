Requires the system to allow each medical holdover patient, each family member of such patient, each commanding officer of a military installation retaining such patients, each patient navigator, and ombudsman office personnel, at all times, to be able to locate and understand exactly where a patient is in the medical holdover process. Requires that the system be updated daily."
