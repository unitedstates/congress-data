Replaces alternative trade adjustment assistance for older workers provisions with eligibility requirements for wage insurance benefits to older workers who have received an industry-wide certification to apply for TAA. Increases the maximum allowance to cover costs of an adversely affected worker for job search expenses and relocation expenses. Establishes an Office of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Ombudsman. Extends the TAA program for workers through FY2012. Revises the TAA program for communities negatively impacted by trade. Establishes a TAA for communities program to coordinate the federal response.
