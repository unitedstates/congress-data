    "text": "National Landscape Conservation System Act - Establishes in the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) the National Landscape Conservation System (thus, enacting into law the National Landscape Conservation System [NLCS] created by BLM in 2000) in order to conserve, protect, and restore nationally significant landscapes that have outstanding cultural, ecological, and scientific values for the benefit of current and future generations. Requires that the NLCS include each of the following areas administered by BLM: (1) each area that is designated as a national monument, a national conservation area, a wilderness study area, a national scenic trail or historic trail designated as a component of the National Trails System, a component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, or a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System; and (2) any area designated by Congress to be administered for conservation purposes, including the Steens Mountain Cooperative Management and Protection Area (as designated under the Steens Mountain Cooperative Management and Protection Act of 2000), the Headwaters Forest Reserve, the Yaquina Head Outstanding Natural Area, and any additional area designated by Congress for inclusion in the NLCS. Prohibits anything in this Act from: (1) being construed to enhance, diminish, or modify any law or proclamation under which the components of the NLCS specified above were established, or are managed, including, but not limited to, the Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act, the Wilderness Act, the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, the National Trails System Act, and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976; (2) creating a federal cause of action based on inclusion within the NLCS; (3) intending to additionally restrict or hinder energy development within such system; (4) affecting the authority, jurisdiction, or responsibility of the several states to manage, control, or regulate fish and resident wildlife under state law or regulations, including the regulation of, or access to, hunting, fishing, trapping, and recreational shooting on BLM-managed public land; (5) limiting access to such activities; (6) affecting current grazing rights or operations due to inclusion in the NLCS; and (7) impeding any efforts by the Department of Homeland Security to secure U.S. borders."
