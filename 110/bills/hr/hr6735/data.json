Revokes all withdrawals of federal submerged lands of the OCS adjacent to Cuba from leasing for exploration for, and development and production of, oil and natural gas. Terminates certain restrictions under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 on the use of funds for certain offshore leasing and related activities with respect to any location on the OCS adjacent to Cuba. Directs the Secretary of the Interior promptly to conduct lease sales for such locations on the OCS in accordance with the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and other federal law."
