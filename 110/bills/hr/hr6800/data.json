Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to: (1) revise requirements with respect to the commercial and personal importation of prescription drugs and the disposition of certain drugs denied admission; and (2) prescribe requirements with respect to Internet sales of prescription drugs. Provides that if any federal agency or any non-profit entity undertakes federally funded health care research and development, and is to convey or provide a patent or other exclusive right to use such research and development for a drug or other health care technology, such agency or entity shall not make such conveyance or provide such patent or other right until the recipient first agrees to a reasonable pricing agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or the Secretary determines that the public interest is served by a waiver of the reasonable pricing agreement. Sets forth Medigap transition requirements."
