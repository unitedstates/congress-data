    "text": "Solid Waste Rail Transfer Facilities Regulation Act of 2008 - Requires a solid waste rail transfer facility to comply with all federal and state solid waste environmental laws (except those requiring permits). Declares that any such facility lacking a state permit shall not be required to possess one (other than a siting permit): (1) if by a certain deadline the facility has applied, in good faith, for all required permits; and (2) until the permitting agency has either approved or denied the permit application. Declares that any such facility that does not possess a state siting permit shall not be required to possess one to continue to operate or to comply with state land use requirements. Authorizes a state governor to petition the Surface Transportation Board to require the facility to apply for a land-use exemption. Requires the Board to accept such a petition and the facility to have such an exception to continue to operate. Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to make modifications to such requirements to protect human health and the environment."
