Provides for public disclosure of the results of such cost-benefit analysis if the government agency determines it is in the public interest to enter into the contract. Authorizes the waiver of such requirements if it is determined that the government agency cannot perform the work to be conducted under the contract with existing or additional government employees because such work is of an emergency, specialty, or intermittent nature."
