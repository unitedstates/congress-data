Title II: Grant Initiatives - (Sec. 201) Allows a lead SBDC to apply for an additional grant to carry out: (1) a capital access initiative program; (2) a disaster recovery program; (3) an innovation and competitiveness services to manufacturers initiative program; (4) a mature entrepreneurs assistance program; or (5) a small business sustainability initiative program.

Requires quarterly reports from participating SBDCs summarizing assistance provided.

Allows only certified SBDCs to participate in the regulatory compliance assistance program, with a waiver if the Administrator determines that the SBDC is making a good faith effort to obtain such certification. Requires the Administrator to select for program participation the SBDC programs of two states from each of ten regional groups of states. Authorizes the Administrator to make additional SBDC program selections. Provides a minimum grant amount of $200,000. Requires the Comptroller General to evaluate the program, and to report evaluation results to the Administrator and the small business committees.
