Requires subgrantees to require their secondary school students to perform at least 100 hours of community service each school year and receive training or counseling on conflict resolution as a prerequisite to performing such service. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide a tax deduction to a business of: (1) $750 per 100 hours of community service provided by such a student through such business during the taxable year; and (2) $2,000 for each graduate of such alternative school or program who completes one year of employment with such business."
