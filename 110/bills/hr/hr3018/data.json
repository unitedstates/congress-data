    "text": "Family Self-Sufficiency Act of 2007 - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to revise requirements for the administrative fee payable to public housing agencies (PHAs) to cover the costs of administering family self-sufficiency programs in connection with the housing choice voucher program of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Prescribes: (1) a base fee for a PHA serving 25 or more program participants equal to the costs of employing one full-time family self-sufficiency coordinator (prorated for an agency serving fewer than 25 such participants); and (2) an additional fee for an agency meeting minimum performance standards to cover the costs of employing a second coordinator if the agency has 75 or more participating families, and a third coordinator if it has 125 or more participating families. Requires the Secretary to publish a proposed rule specifying the performance standards applicable to funding such additional fees and agencies that have received HUD funding for more than three such coordinators between FY1998-FY2007. Requires PHAs receiving such funds to collect and report to the Secretary information on the performance of their family self-sufficiency programs. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a formal and scientific evaluation of the effectiveness of well-run family self-sufficiency programs, using random assignment of participants to the extent practicable; and (2) submit interim and final reports to Congress. Authorizes appropriations for the evaluation. Permits the Secretary to reserve up to 10% of the amounts available for administrative fees to provide support to or reward family self-sufficiency programs that are particularly innovative or highly successful in achieving program goals."
