Modifies the duties of the Secretary of Energy under such Act relating to: (1) updating the national model building energy codes and standards for residential and commercial buildings; (2) reporting requirements; (3) providing technical assistance to model code-setting and standard development organizations; and (4) incentive funding to states for implementing updates of building energy efficiency codes. Requires states to certify to the Secretary that they have reviewed and updated the provisions of their residential and commercial building energy efficiency codes and to certify compliance with such codes. Imposes additional requirements on states that fail to meet compliance deadlines."
