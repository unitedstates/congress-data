Defines a hybrid motor vehicle as one that achieves at least: (1) 25% better fuel economy ratings than comparable gasoline fueled vehicles; or (2) 10% better fuel economy ratings than comparable gasoline fueled vehicles, and is determined by the Secretary of Energy to be appropriate for consideration as an alternative fueled vehicle on the basis of improved emissions, availability, or technological innovation."
