Instructs the Secretary to consult with the Colorado Division of Wildlife regarding possible participation by it in the implementation of such Plan. Prohibits anything in this Act from being construed as applicable to the taking of wildlife within Rocky Mountain National Park for any purpose other than the implementation of the Elk and Vegetation Management Plan."
