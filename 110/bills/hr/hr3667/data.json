Directs the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) analyze any potential impacts on the possession or use of a weapon, trap, or net, including a concealed weapon, on the Missisquoi and Trout Rivers or on lands adjacent to that area; (2) include in the study an assessment of any effect a wild and scenic designation in the study area is likely to have on energy production, transmission, or conveyance; (3) analyze the potential impact of the designation on private lands within the Rivers or adjacent to that area; and (4) complete the study of the Missisquoi and Trout Rivers and submit a report describing the results of the study.
