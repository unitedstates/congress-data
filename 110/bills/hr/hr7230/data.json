(Currently such powers are exercised by an Electric Reliability Organization [ERO].) Revises penalty guidelines to subject to federal criminal law any person who violates a FERC-approved electric reliability standard. Requires FERC to issue a rule in connection with electric reliability standards to prohibit disturbances (other than planned maintenance) lasting greater than five days at certain substations. Instructs the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to study and report to Congress on gaps in emergency planning preparedness and management as related to specified, vulnerable populations."
