    "text": "Reverse Mortgage Proceeds Protection Act - Amends the National Housing Act of 1937 to modify the eligibility criteria for insurance of home equity conversion mortgages (reverse mortgages) of elderly home owners. Excludes from the third party adequate counseling requirement counseling by a reverse mortgage lender, servicer or investor, or an entity engaged in the sale of annuities, investments, long-term care insurance, or any other type of financial or insurance product. Repeals the waiver of upfront insurance premiums for mortgages to fund long-term care insurance. Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to use a portion of reverse mortgage insurance premiums to fund mandatory counseling and disclosure activities, including counseling for homeowners who elect not to take out a home equity conversion mortgage. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations to protect elderly homeowners from the marketing of financial and insurance products not in their interest, including the marketing or sale of an annuity as a precondition to obtaining a home equity conversion mortgage."
