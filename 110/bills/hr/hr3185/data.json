Requires the Secretary of Labor to prescribe a model statement that may be used for purposes of satisfying such requirements. Limits the requirements for such a statement to contracts for services if the total cost for such services equals or exceeds $1,000.Requires an administrator of an individual account plan that permits participants or beneficiaries to exercise control over their account assets to: (1) provide to each such participant or beneficiary a notice of the investment options available for election, including a fee menu and an annual benefit statement; and (2) include at least one investment option that is a nationally recognized market-based index fund that meets certain requirements. Requires the Secretary to make available to small employers: (1) educational and compliance materials to assist in selecting and monitoring service providers for individual account plans, investment options, and fees; and (2) services to assist in finding and understanding affordable investment options for such plans. Establishes in the Department of Labor (DOL) an Advisory Council on Improving Employer-Employee Retirement Practices. Requires the Council to issue an annual report on the state of U.S. retirement income security.Sets forth provisions regarding enforcement of this Act."
