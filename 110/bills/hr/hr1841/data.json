Establishes the AmeriCare Trust Fund.Requires the modification of Medicaid (SSA title XIX), SCHIP (SSA title XXI (State Children's Health Insurance Program), and other federal health programs to avoid their duplication of AmeriCare coverage. Provides for the regulation of AmeriCare supplemental policies.Establishes the general obligations for individuals and employers for the cost of health insurance coverage provided under this Act.
