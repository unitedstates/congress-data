Authorizes reimbursement of reductions in basic pay for educational assistance coverage in the case of extended active-duty service. Provides similar eligibility for the transfer of educational assistance for members of the Selected Reserve who have completed at least six years of service and enter into an agreement to remain a member of such Reserve for at least four more years. Provides educational assistance eligibility credit for cumulative active-duty service in the Selected Reserve. Increases the rates of educational assistance under the Reserve Montgomery GI Bill. Applies an annual adjustment to the rates of survivors' and dependents' educational assistance."
