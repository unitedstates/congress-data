Requires such individuals to pay the full cost of the training.(Sec. 2017) Directs the Secretary to provide public access to water resource and related water quality data in the custody of the Corps. (Sec. 2018) Declares that it is U.S. policy to promote beach nourishment for purposes of flood damage reduction and hurricane and storm damage reduction and related research that encourages the protection, restoration, and enhancement of sandy beaches on a comprehensive basis, with preference to areas in which there has been a federal investment and where the need for prevention or mitigation of damage is attributable to federal activities.(Sec. 2019) Amends the WRDA of 1986 to require the development of new criteria and procedures regarding the ability of a nonfederal interest to pay (with respect to cost-sharing agreements) by December 31, 2007. Directs the Secretary to apply such criteria and procedures to specified projects in Missouri, Texas, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania.(Sec. 2020) Amends the WRDA of 1996 to authorize projects that improve elements and features of an estuary and projects for the removal of dams that otherwise meet Act requirements.(Sec. 2021) Increases the amount the Secretary may allot under: (1) the Flood Control Act of 1948 for small flood control projects; (2) the River and Harbor Act of 1960 for small river and harbor improvement projects; and (3) the Flood Control Act of 1946 for the construction, repair, restoration, and modification of emergency streambank and shoreline protection works to prevent damage to highways, bridge approaches, and public works, churches, hospitals, schools, and other nonprofit public services.Increases authorized appropriations under the WRDA of: (1) 1986 for project modifications to improve the environment; and (2) 1999 for remediation of abandoned mine sites.(Sec. 2026) Authorizes the Secretary to grant leases of lands, including structures or facilities, at water resource development projects to federally recognized Indian tribes.(Sec. 2027) Directs the Chief to submit to specified committees an annual report on expenditures: (1) for the preceding and current fiscal years; and (2) by the Corps necessary in the following fiscal year, for each project or activity not scheduled for completion in the current fiscal year, to maintain the same level of effort.(Sec. 2028) Authorizes the Secretary to provide assistance to specified universities or colleges in Tennessee, Illinois, and Texas for water resources-related studies.(Sec. 2029) Expresses the sense of Congress that the Corps' operations and maintenance budget should reflect the use of all available economic data, rather than a single performance metric.(Sec. 2030) Modifies provisions of the WRDA of 1996 to authorize the Secretary to engage in activities, including contracting, in support of other federal agencies, international organizations, or foreign governments to address problems of national significance. Authorizes funding. Authorizes the Secretary to accept and expend additional funds from foreign governments.(Sec. 2031) Declares that it is U.S. policy that all water resources projects reflect national priorities, encourage economic development, and protect the environment by: (1) seeking to maximize sustainable economic development; (2) seeking to avoid the unwise use of floodplains and flood-prone areas and maximizing adverse impacts and vulnerabilities where such areas must be used; and (3) protecting and restoring the functions of, and mitigating unavoidable damage to, natural systems.(Sec. 2032) Directs the President to report to Congress describing U.S. vulnerability to damage from flooding, including: (1) an assessment of the extent to which programs relating to flooding address flood risk reduction priorities; (2) the extent to which those programs may be encouraging development and economic activity in flood-prone areas; and (3) recommendations for improving those programs.(Sec. 2033) Amends the WRDA of 1996 to direct the Secretary, for all feasibility reports completed after December 31, 2007, to assess whether: (1) the project and each separable element is cost-effective; and (2) the water resource project complies with laws and public policies.Directs the Chief to: (1) adopt a risk analysis approach to project cost estimates for water resources projects; (2) issue procedures for risk analysis for cost estimation and submit to Congress a report that includes suggested amendments to provisions regarding maximum cost of projects; (3) establish benchmarks for determining the time it should take to conduct a project feasibility study and its associated review process under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; (4) use such benchmarks to make the feasibility study process more efficient; and (5) establish benchmark goals for completing project feasibility studies within two years (or within four years for complex projects).Requires a feasibility study for a flood damage reduction project to include, as part of the cost/benefit calculation, calculations: (1) of the residual risk of flooding, of loss of human life, and to human safety following completion of the proposed project; (2) of any upstream or downstream impacts; and (3) to ensure that the benefits and costs associated with structural and nonstructural alternatives are evaluated in an equitable manner.Authorizes the Secretary to establish centers to provide specialized planning expertise for water resource projects to be carried out by the Secretary in order to enhance and supplement the capabilities of the districts of the Corps.Requires feasibility and other studies and assessments of water resource problems and projects to include recommendations for alternatives: (1) that, as determined by the nonfederal interests for the projects, promote integrated water resources management; and (2) for which the nonfederal interests are willing to provide the nonfederal share for the studies or assessments. Provides that the completion of a Chief's report for a project shall not be delayed while consideration is being given to potential changes in policy or priority for project consideration. Requires completed reports to be submitted to specified committees and reviewed by the Secretary, who shall provide any recommendations to Congress.(Sec. 2034) Requires project studies to be subject to a peer review by an independent panel of experts if: (1) the project has an estimated total cost of more than $45 million, including mitigation costs; (2) the governor of an affected state requests a peer review by an independent panel of experts; or (3) the Chief determines that the project study is controversial (in cases where there is a significant public dispute as to the nature or effects of the project or the economic or environmental costs or benefits). Limits costs of panels.
