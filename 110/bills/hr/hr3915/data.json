    "text": "Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007 - Title I: Residential Mortgage Loan Origination - Subtitle A: Licensing System for Residential Mortgage Loan Originators - Encourages the states, through the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators, to establish a Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry (NMLSR) for the residential mortgage industry. (Sec. 103) Includes among licensing and registration requirements that a loan origination business obtain: (1) a unique identifier; and (2) instruction on fraud, consumer protection, and fair lending issues. Exempts certain loan processors and underwriters from the licensing or registration requirements.Requires independent contractors who work as loan processors or underwriters to be either licensed or registered.(Sec. 104) Sets forth state license and registration procedures. (Sec. 105) Prescribes minimum standards for license renewal for state-licensed loan originators. Requires the NMLSR to review and publish, but prohibits its from offering, directly or indirectly, pre-licensure educational courses for loan originators. (Sec. 106) Requires federal banking agencies to develop and maintain jointly a system for registering employees of depository institutions or their subsidiaries as registered loan originators with the NMLSR. Requires such agencies to: (1) include in the information furnished to the NMLSR the personal history and experience of such employees; and (2) authorize the NMLSR to obtain information related to any administrative, civil or criminal findings by any governmental jurisdiction. (Sec. 107) Instructs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to provide for a licensing and registration system governing loan originators operating in a state which: (1) does not have such a system in place within a prescribed time frame; or (2) does not participate in the NMLSR. Instructs the Secretary to coordinate with the NMLSR to establish protocols for assigning a unique identifier to each loan originator licensed by HUD as a state-licensed loan originator that will facilitate electronic tracking and uniform identification of, and public access to, the employment history and the publicly adjudicated disciplinary and enforcement actions against loan originators. (Sec. 108) Directs the Secretary to establish a back-up licensing and registry system any time the Secretary determines that the NMLSR is failing to meet the requirements and purposes of this Act for a comprehensive licensing, supervisory, and tracking system for loan originators. (Sec. 109) Authorizes the federal banking agencies, HUD, and the NMLSR to charge fees to cover the costs of maintaining and providing access to NMLSR information to the extent such fees are not charged to consumers for access to such system and registry.(Sec. 110) Instructs the Attorney General to provide access to all criminal history information to state regulators of loan originators if such checks are required for state licenses.(Sec. 111) Provides for confidentiality of information.(Sec. 112) Shields from liability regulatory entities performing in good faith information collection and dissemination under this Act. (Sec. 113) Grants the Secretary enforcement authority to implement this Act, including assessment of civil monetary penalties. Subtitle B: Residential Mortgage Loan Origination Standards - (Sec. 122) Amends the Truth in Lending Act to set forth a duty of care standard for residential mortgage loan originations. (Sec. 123) Prohibits the payment of steering incentive compensation to mortgage originators based on, or varying with, the terms (other than principal amount) of any loan that is not a qualified mortgage. Requires the federal banking agencies jointly to prescribe regulations to implement this Act.(Sec. 124) Subjects mortgage originators to liability for monetary penalties for violations of this Act.Title II: Minimum Standards for Mortgages - (Sec. 201) Sets forth minimum repayment standards for residential mortgage loans.Requires creditors to determine, based on verified and documented information, that a consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan, according to its terms (taxes, insurance, and assessments), including the consumer's repayment ability if multiple loans are secured by the same dwelling.Requires a creditor to take into consideration: (1) variable rate loans that defer repayment of any principal or interest (nonstandard loans); (2) interest-only loans; and (3) any balance increase that may accrue from any negative amortization.(Sec. 202) Prohibits a creditor from extending credit for residential mortgage loans that involve refinancing of a prior residential mortgage loan unless the creditor determines that refinancing provides a net tangible benefit to the consumer.Describes residential mortgage loans which do not provide a net tangible benefit to the consumer.(Sec. 203) Sets forth a rebuttable presumption of the ability to repay. (Sec. 204) Subjects a creditor to civil liability for violations of this Act, including rescission of a residential mortgage loan and certain additional costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee of the obligor. Subjects an assignee or securitizer of such a loan, acting in good faith, to liability for a creditor's violations, but only for rescission of the loan, plus related costs and attorney fees. Exempts an assignee or securitizer from such liability if it provides a cure, and meets other specified requirements. Permits a consumer to maintain a civil action against an assignee to cure, but not rescind, a residential mortgage loan, if a creditor or assignee of a loan has: (1) ceased to exist as a matter of law; (2) filed for bankruptcy protection; or (3) had receivers or liquidating agents appointed.
