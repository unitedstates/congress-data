Transfers to the Highway Trust Fund increased tax revenues resulting from such repeal.Requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to monitor gasoline prices in the United States and to report to Congress on its findings.Requires the Speaker of the House of Representatives to establish a Commission on Gas Price Relief to study the causes of high oil prices."
