    "text": "Knowledge Is Power Act - Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to require electric utilities to disclose prominently on consumers' periodic billing statements the percentage mix of energy technologies and fuels used to generate the electricity sold within the distribution utility's distribution area. Requires such disclosure to specify the percentage of electricity generated from coal, from gas, from nuclear, from any other fuel, and from any particular type of renewable energy (including solar, wind, biomass, landfill gas, ocean tidal, ocean wave, ocean current, ocean thermal, geothermal, municipal solid waste, or hydroelectric). Declares compliance requirements inapplicable if before enactment of this Act: (1) the state has implemented for such utility the standard concerned, or a comparable one; (2) the state regulatory authority or relevant nonregulated electric utility has conducted a proceeding to consider the standard's implementation; or (3) the state legislature has voted on its implementation."
