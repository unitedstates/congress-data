Subtitle A: Funding - (Sec. 101) Prescribes formulae for new base CHIP allotments for states and territories beginning with FY2008. (Sec. 102) Makes CHIP allotments for FY2008 and each following fiscal year available for two years only (currently three years). (Sec. 103) Provides for redistribution of unused allotments to address state funding shortfalls. (Sec. 104) Increases from 20% to 30% the percentage of any CHIP allotment that a state may use for Medicaid payments after FY2007. Subtitle B: Improving Enrollment and Retention of Eligible Children - (Sec. 111) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make performance bonus payments to states to offset the additional Medicaid and CHIP child enrollment costs resulting from enrollment and retention efforts.
