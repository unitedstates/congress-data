Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to only allow uses of the Preservation Area that will further the purposes for which it is established. Permits the use of motorized vehicles or mechanized transport in the Preservation Area, only on roads and trails designated for vehicular use under the management plan, except as needed for administrative purposes or to respond to an emergency.

Authorizes the Secretary to allow grazing only for the purpose of vegetative management to enhance lesser prairie chicken habitat.
