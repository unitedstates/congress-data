States as the policy of the United States not to enter into a preemptive war against Iran in the absence of an immediate threat, and then only in accordance with international law and constitutional and statutory requirements for congressional authorization. Prohibits funds available to the Department of Defense (DOD) or any other federal department or agency from being used to carry out any covert action for the purpose of causing regime change in Iran or to carry out any military action against Iran in the absence of an imminent threat."
