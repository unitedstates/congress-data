Amends federal law governing prohibited funding of unlawful Internet gambling to declare that no person shall be subject to criminal liability arising out of certain bets or wagers by means of the Internet. Defines criminal liability to include actions against real or personal property that arise from or depend upon the allegedly criminal nature of the bet or wager or of the transmission or receipt of funds in connection with that bet or wager."
