Requires state child welfare agencies to document their efforts to pursue special immigrant juvenile status and legal immigrant status for eligible alien foster children. Requires the permanency hearing for an alien child who will not be returned to a parent to determine: (1) whether petitions for special immigrant juvenile status and lawful permanent resident status have been filed on the child's behalf; and (2) if no petition has been filed, whether it is in the best interests of the child to have such a petition filed or to have immigration counsel appointed. Authorizes the use of court improvement program grant funds to educate and train judges and lawyers to assist alien children in achieving special immigrant juvenile status and lawful permanent resident status."
