Requires such projects to be carried out with the goal of translating the Diabetes Prevention Program clinical trial into interventions to reduce the incidence of type-2 diabetes and its related complications in the U.S. population.Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director, to engage in partnerships with state and local health departments to carry out: (1) national, state, and local surveillance related to diabetes; and (2) education and information campaigns to increase awareness about the importance of primary prevention, ways to assess personal risk, and how to locate and access diabetes prevention programs.Requires the Director, acting through the Division, to develop a pilot program to improve treatment for individuals with diabetes and other co-occurring chronic conditions for which treatment may complicate the treatment for diabetes. Requires the Director to give preference to research that: (1) focuses on conditions which have a high prevalence among individuals with diabetes or for which the treatment involved has the potential to impact adherence to diabetes treatment regiments; and (2) builds upon existing work designed to improve the quality of care for patients with diabetes."
