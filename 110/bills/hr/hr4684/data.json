Reduces by 50 percent the rates of tax levied on a self-employed individual for old age, survivors and disability insurance and hospital insurance if a physician has certified that such individual has a terminal disease or cancer throughout the taxable year or is the primary caregiver for a spouse, parent, or child with a terminal disease or cancer."
