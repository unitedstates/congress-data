(Thus suspends for such year the \"tuition sensitivity provision\" which prohibits maximum Pell Grant awards to students attending low-tuition institutions of higher education even if their income is low enough to otherwise qualify for the maximum award.) Amends the Federal Family Education Loan program to lower from 23% to 22% for FY2008, the percentage of a borrower's student loan payment made subsequent to default that a guaranty agency may retain for deposit in its operating fund if the Secretary of Education has already reimbursed it for such default."
