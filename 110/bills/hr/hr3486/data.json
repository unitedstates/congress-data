Defines such property to include: (1) an emergency communication technology or device for constant communication with individuals outside the mine; (2) an electronic identification and location device; (3) an emergency oxygen-generating device; (4) pre-positioned oxygen supplies; and (5) a comprehensive atmospheric monitoring system to monitor levels of carbon monoxide and other gases present in a mine.Revises the tax credit for mine rescue team training expenses to: (1) increase the amount of such credit; (2) allow such credit as an offset against the alternative minimum tax; and (3) make such credit permanent."
