Prohibits such person, individual, or employee, after such a revocation or nonrenewal, from transferring a firearm that had been in such inventory, except to another firearms licensee. Requires license revocation notices to set forth the provisions of federal laws prohibiting an unlicensed individual from dealing in firearms."
