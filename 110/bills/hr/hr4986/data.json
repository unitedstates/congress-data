(Sec. 134) Prohibits the Secretary of the Air Force from retiring C-130E/H tactical airlift aircraft during FY2008. Provides an exception for up to 24 C-130E aircraft, as long as such Secretary: (1) maintains the aircraft in a condition that would allow their recall to future service; and (2) submits the fleet mix analysis study to the defense and appropriations committees.

Revises the MDA budget structure for FY2009. States that funds appropriated for FY2009 for RDT&E for the MDA: (1) may be used for the development and fielding of ballistic missile defense (BMD) capabilities; and (2) may not be used for military construction or procurement or advance procurement of long lead items. Requires the MDA Director to submit to the defense committees a plan for transitioning the MDA from using exclusively RDT&E funds to using procurement, military construction, operation and maintenance (O&M), and RDT&E funds for appropriate budget activities, and for transitioning from incremental funding to full funding for fiscal years after 2010.

Directs the Secretary to select a FFRDC to conduct an independent assessment of options for ballistic missile defense for forward deployed forces of the United States and its allies in Europe. Requires the FFRDC to report assessment results to the Secretary and the defense and appropriations committees. Provides funding. (Sec. 227) Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should have an active program of BMD cooperation with Israel, and should take steps to improve the coordination, interoperability, and integration of their mutual BMD capabilities. Requires a report from the Secretary to the defense and appropriations committees on the status of missile defense cooperation between the two countries. (Sec. 228) Prohibits funds from being obligated or expended to deploy more than 40 ground-based interceptors at Fort Greely, Alaska, until the Secretary certifies to Congress that the Block 2006 ground-based midcourse defense element of the BMD system has demonstrated a high probability of working in an effective manner.
