Title II: Undersea Research Program - National Undersea Research Program Act of 2007 - (Sec. 202) Requires the Administrator to conduct an undersea research, exploration, education, and technology development program to increase scientific knowledge regarding management, use, and preservation of oceanic, coastal, and Great Lakes resources. Requires the program's director to cooperate with institutions of higher education and other educational marine and ocean science organizations and to make available undersea research facilities, equipment, technologies, information, and expertise to support those organizations' undersea research. Authorizes the director to enter into partnerships with the private sector to achieve program goals and to promote marine industry technological advancement. (Sec. 204) Requires that the program be conducted through a national headquarters, a network of extramural regional undersea research centers representing all NOAA regions, and the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology. (Sec. 205) Specifies the research, exploration, education, and technology programs to be conducted through the network of extramural regional centers and the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology. (Sec. 206) Allows not more than ten percent of the program's budget to be used for administration and for priority undersea research projects not covered by funding available from centers. Requires a competition every five years to select the regional centers that will participate in the program.
