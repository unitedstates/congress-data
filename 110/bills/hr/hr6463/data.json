Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to waive the application of any federal law that requires a permit to engage in drilling for oil or gas under a lease of federal lands or federal submerged lands during any period in which the most recent spot market price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil at the domestic spot market at Cushing, Oklahoma, is less than $100 per barrel. Requires such a waiver during any period in which the most recent spot price is equal to or greater than $100 per barrel. Requires the Department of Energy to act as the lead agency to coordinate all applicable federal refinery authorizations and related environmental reviews with respect to a designated refinery. Requires each federal and state agency or official required to provide a federal refinery authorization to cooperate with the Secretary of Energy and comply with deadlines the Secretary establishes. Requires the Secretary to establish a schedule for all federal refinery authorizations with respect to a designated refinery. Requires the Secretary to approve an application for a federal refinery authorization within 30 days after any failure of a federal or state administrative agency or official to complete an approval proceeding in accordance with the schedule established by the Secretary."
