Calls upon the governments of Chad and Sudan to: (1) reaffirm their commitment to the Tripoli Declaration of February 8, 2006, and the N'Djamena Agreement of July 26, 2006; (2) refrain from any actions that violate these agreements; and (3) cease all support to each others' insurgent groups. Urges the government of Chad to: (1) improve accountability as well as the provision of basic services to redeem its legitimacy in the eyes of its citizens; and (2) take action to increase political participation and to strengthen democratic institutions. Urges the government of Chad, the government of Sudan, and other key regional and international stakeholders to commit to another round of inclusive political negotiations that can bring regional peace. Urges the government of the Central African Republic to: (1) to engage in inclusive dialogue with rebels in the northwestern region of the country; (2) hold accountable security forces engaging in human rights violations; and (3) strengthen government services in order to meet the needs of affected populations. Calls upon the President to urge the U.N. Security Council to appoint a senior U.N. official to coordinate all international humanitarian activities on both sides of Sudan's western border and expand the response to emergency needs in the Central African Republic. Urges the President to press for the immediate deployment of an advance U.N. mission to eastern Chad and northern Central African Republic to lay the groundwork for a multilateral and multidimensional presence. Urges the Security Council to authorize a multilateral peacekeeping force to eastern Chad and northern Central African Republic to: (1) ensure effective protection of civilians, particularly refugees and internally displaced persons; (2) organize regular patrols along the western border of Sudan and implement protection measures for asylum seekers; (3) maintain the civilian and humanitarian nature of the internally displaced persons and refugee camps in Chad; (4) ensure the safety of humanitarian workers; (5) share information with humanitarian organizations; (6) collect and report evidence of human rights violations and perpetrators to the United Nations; and (7) support domestic and multilateral initiatives to strengthen local judicial, police, and correctional systems in Chad. Urges the President and the international community to coordinate assistance efforts."
