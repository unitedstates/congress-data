Affirms that restoration of the Republic of Georgia's territorial integrity is in the interest of all who seek regional peace. Urges all parties to the conflicts in the Republic of Georgia and governments around the world to eschew rhetoric that escalates tensions and undermines negotiation efforts. Commends the government of Georgia for acting with restraint in the face of serious provocation."
