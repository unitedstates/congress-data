Requires investigation, in particular, of allegations of wasteful and fraudulent practices, including allegations regarding any contract or spending entered into, supervised by, or otherwise involving the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), regardless of whether or not such contract or spending involved U.S. appropriated funds. Declares that it is the sense of the Senate that any claim of fraud, waste, or abuse under the False Claims Act that involves any contract or spending by the CPA should be considered a claim against the U.S. Government."
