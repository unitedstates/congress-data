    "text": "Affirms that the people of the United States stand in unison with the people of India in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai. Notes that these attacks did not only target citizens of India but represented a collective assault against the international community. Encourages the government of India to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the attacks and applauds the government of India's restraint in reaction to these horrific attacks. Urges the government of Pakistan to investigate the possible connection of groups based in Pakistan to the Mumbai attacks and to take action to apprehend the suspects. Calls upon the government of Pakistan to to root out extremist groups operating on its territory, halt attacks aimed at Pakistan and any other countries, and ensure that no government elements support such groups. Encourages President-elect Obama to consider ways in which the United States can bolster counter-terrorism cooperation with India. Urges bolstered U.S. efforts to implement policies to combat all forms of religious extremism, including anti-Semitism, in order to deter the type of targeted attacks like that waged against the Chabad Lubavitch center in Mumbai."
