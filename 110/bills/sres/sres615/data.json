Calls on the European Union to focus on the elimination of all forms of discrimination in Turkey, particularly regarding the Ecumenical Patriarchate, while continuing negotiations on the accession of Turkey to the European Union. Calls on Turkey to: (1) remove an obstacle in its U.S. relations by taking steps to provide the Patriarchate's full religious freedom; (2) recognize the right to the title of \"Ecumenical Patriarch\"; (3) grant the Patriarch appropriate international recognition and ecclesiastic succession; (4) grant the Patriarch the right to train clergy of all nationalities; and (5) respect the Patriarchate's property and human rights."
