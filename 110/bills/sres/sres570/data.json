Supports: (1) the invitations to initiate an Intensified Dialogue between NATO and Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Serbia; (2) the aspirations of Ukraine and Georgia to become integrated into the Euro-Atlantic community; and (3) the enlargement of NATO, and the NATO declaration at the Bucharest Summit that NATO should remain open to European democracies able to assume membership responsibilities. Affirms that any decision about NATO membership will be made through member consensus and that no country outside of NATO has a vote or veto with respect to such decisions."
