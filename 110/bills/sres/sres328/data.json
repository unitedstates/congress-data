    "text": "Expresses condolences to the families of Antoine Ghanem and other victims of the September 19, 2007, attack, as well as to all the people of Lebanon. Condemns such attack and urges that its perpetrators, including any state sponsor or official, be held accountable for their crimes. Underscores Senate support for the special international tribunal and urges the U.N. Security Council to extend its jurisdiction to include the Ghanem assassination. Urges the President to increase coordination with key partners in Europe and the Middle East to support Lebanon's sovereignty and strengthen its governing institutions and security forces. States that the people of Lebanon should be permitted to choose their next president, in a process scheduled to begin in September 2007, free from foreign interference and violence."
