Calls on the United Nations Human Rights Council to monitor and demand compliance with the recommendations of the representatives of those special mechanisms that have already visited Iran. Supports: (1) the continued designation of Iran as a \"country of particular concern\" under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998; (2) funding to promote democracy and human rights in Iran; (3) the commission of an independent review of Voice of America Persian and Radio Farda; and (4) the establishment of a diplomatic envoy to Iran. Calls on the government of Iran to: (1) release all prisoners held because of their religious or political beliefs; and (2) respect the human rights of all its citizens."
