Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the provincial government of Kosovo should ensure the full political and economic rights of Serbs and other minority communities in Kosovo; (2) the international community should recognize that additional negotiations and diplomacy does not represent a delay of the Kosovo process, and that the government of Serbia currently has legal sovereignty over Kosovo; and (3) the government of Serbia should continue toward a peaceful future through integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions and toward the establishment of constructive relations with the provincial government of Kosovo."
