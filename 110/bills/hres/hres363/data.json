Allows the use of such funds also if the aircraft: (1) is owned or leased by the Member or a family member (including a privately owned aircraft in which such Member or family member has an ownership interest, and the Member does not use the aircraft any more than the proportionate share of ownership allows); or (3) is operated by a state or federal entity. Allows the use of such funds also for a flight that consists of the personal use of an aircraft supplied to a Member by an individual on the basis of personal friendship."
