Looks forward to another 35 years of continuous Landsat-like observations of the Earth. Urges the continuation of such program and its long-term and comprehensive record of collecting global land surface data so as to sustain Landsat's value to scientific research, especially the study of global and climate change, and to the multiple applied uses of Landsat data for societal benefit."
