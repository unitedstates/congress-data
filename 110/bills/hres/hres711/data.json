Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act of 2006 (Hyde Act), and resolved with the government of India all differences of interpretation in the nuclear cooperation agreement; and (2) support a proposed exemption for India in the NSG guidelines that is not consistent with the Hyde Act and the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and that does not incorporate specified provisions."
