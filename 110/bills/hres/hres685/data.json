Calls on: (1) the Illinois legislature to repeal Illinois Public Act 095-0138, which violates federal law by denying employers the right to verify potential employees' legal status; and (2) the Governor of Illinois to file an amicus brief in the case of United States v. Illinois supporting the plaintiff's conclusion that Illinois Public Act 095-0138 violates the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution."
