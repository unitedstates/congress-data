States that U.S. goals for the next SED meeting should be to achieve Chinese commitments toward: (1) removal of all foreign investment ownership caps on banking, life insurance, asset management, and securities; and (2) nondiscriminatory treatment of U.S. financial services firms with regard to licensing, corporate form, and permitted products and services, as well as regulation and supervision. Urges U.S. financial service regulators, in assessing whether applications from Chinese financial institutions meet comprehensive consolidated supervision standards, to consider: (1) whether such applications are for operations and activities in the United States that are currently prohibited for U.S. financial institutions in China; and (2) the extent to which such prohibitions reflect problems with the quality of home country supervision."
