Declares that, as disposition of such a point of order, the Chair shall put the question of consideration with respect to the measure, and it shall be debatable for 10 minutes by the Member initiating the point of order and for 10 minutes by an opponent. Declares further, however, that the question shall otherwise be decided without intervening motion except one that the House adjourn."
