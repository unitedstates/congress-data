Requires a two-thirds rollcall vote of each chamber to increase the public debt limit. Directs the President to submit a balanced budget to Congress annually. Requires a two-thirds rollcall vote of each chamber for final adoption of any bill to increase the internal revenue. Authorizes waivers of these provisions when a declaration of war is in effect or under other specified circumstances involving military conflict."
