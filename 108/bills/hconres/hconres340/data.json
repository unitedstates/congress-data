Urges the United States to support Taiwan as a blossoming democracy, including its adoption of such democratic practices as the use of referenda votes. Urges the United States to: (1) continue to be a strong supporter of Taiwanese membership in the World Health Organization (WHO); and (2) raise the issue of Taiwanese referenda votes, and membership in the WHO, at future meetings with Chinese officials."
