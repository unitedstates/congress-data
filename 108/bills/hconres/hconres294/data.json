Recognizes that the people of the United States need to address the issue of domestic oil consumption by considering: (1) the amount of money spent on foreign oil; (2) the purposes for which that money is used by its recipients; and (3) the nation's dependence on oil, specifically on oil from OPEC countries, and its effect on national security."
