The summary of that version is repeated here.)Condemns the selection of Libya to chair the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.Commends the President and the Administration and those countries which joined the United States for objecting to Libya's selection.Expresses dismay at the European Union common position of abstention on the critical vote over Libya's chairmanship.Promises to hold accountable countries who voted in favor of Libya's chairmanship.Calls on countries at various stages of democratization to demonstrate their commitment to human rights, democracy, peace and security, and support efforts to reform the Commission.Calls on the President to instruct the Secretary of State to consult with the appropriate congressional committees regarding the U.S. priorities and strategy for the 59th session of the Commission and strategy and proposals for its reform.Requests the President to object to the continued suspension of sanctions against Libya and call for their full reinstatement until Libya: (1) publicly accepts responsibility for the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing; (2) provides appropriate compensation to the victims; and (3) is in full compliance with all UN sanctions imposed as a result of Libya's orchestration of the Pan Am 103 terrorist attack.Calls on the Secretary of State to engage member countries to support U.S. efforts to ensure that states that are gross violators of human rights, sponsors of terrorist activities, or subject to UN sanctions will not be elected to leadership positions in the UN General Assembly nor will they be elected to membership or leadership positions on the UN Commission on Human Rights, the UN Security Council, or any other UN entity or affiliated agency."
