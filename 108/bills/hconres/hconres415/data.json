Recognizes that a precondition for the full integration of Ukraine into the Western community of nations, including as an equal member in institutions such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), is its establishment of a democratic political system. Urges the Government of Ukraine to: (1) guarantee freedom of association and assembly, including the right of candidates, members of political parties, and others to freely assemble, to organize and conduct public events, and to exercise these and other rights free from intimidation or harassment; and (2) meet its Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) commitments on democratic elections. Urges the Ukrainian authorities to ensure the full transparency of election procedures before, during, and after the 2004 presidential elections. Pledges support and assistance to the Ukrainian people's establishment of a free and open democratic system, creation of a free market economy, and their country's assumption of a full and equal membership in the Western community of democracies. Encourages the President to communicate to the Government of Ukraine, to all parties and candidates, and to the people of Ukraine the high importance attached by the United States to this presidential campaign as a central factor in determining the future relationship between the two countries."
