    "text": "Anti-Terrorism and Port Security Act of 2003 - Amends the Federal criminal code to make it unlawful to: (1) destroy or interfere with vessels or maritime facilities; (2) put devices in U.S. waters that can destroy a ship or cargo or interfere with safe navigation or maritime commerce; (3) use a dangerous weapon or explosive to try to kill someone on board a passenger vessel; (4) fail to heave to (that is, to slow or stop) a vessel at the direction of a Coast Guard or other authorized Federal law enforcement official seeking to board that vessel, or to interfere with boarding by such an officer; (5) destroy an aid to maritime navigation (such as a buoy or shoal/breakwater light) maintained by the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation or the Coast Guard if this would endanger the safe navigation of a vessel; or (6) knowingly discharge or release oil, a hazardous substance, a noxious liquid substance or any other substance (malicious dumping) into U.S. navigable waters or the adjoining shoreline with intent to endanger human life, health, or welfare. Revises piracy and privateering laws, increasing penalties. Requires the Attorney General to coordinate port-related crime data collection. Designates the Captain-of-the-Port as the primary authority for seaport security at each port. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to specify mandatory information in cargo manifests, which must be transmitted electronically. Establishes criminal penalties for violations of requirements, and increases civil penalties. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) develop a shipment profiling plan to track containers (including empty containers) and shipments of merchandise to be imported into the United States; (2) submit to Congress a plan for inspecting merchandise and their transportation containers at foreign facilities before importation into the United States; (3) issue final regulations prescribing seaport security requirements, including unauthorized gun and explosives prohibitions, access restrictions, and specifications for biometric (\"smart\") identification cards for employees and other personnel; and (4) approve minimum standards for high security container seals meeting specified criteria, and award grants to developers of such seals. Requires Captains-of-the-Port to secure and protect all sensitive information, including maps, blueprints, and information on the Internet."
