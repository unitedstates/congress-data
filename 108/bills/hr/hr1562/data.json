Mandates that whenever the Secretary furnishes care and services to a person other than a veteran, the United States shall have the right to recover the costs of such care and services in the same manner and to the same extent as care and services provided to a veteran. Designates the following Department of Veterans Affairs facilities as follows: (1) the health care facility located at 820 South Damen Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, as the Jesse Brown Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center; and (2) the outpatient clinic in New London, Connecticut, as the John J. McGuirk Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic."
