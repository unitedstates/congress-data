    "text": "Furthering Education and Research through Mantis Improvements Act or FERMI Act - Requires the Secretary of State to: (1) provide consular officers with improved guidance regarding the operational structure and requirements of the Visas Mantis security check program (which protects against illegal transfers of sensitive technology); and (2) provide greater specificity in the Technology Alert List used under the program. Requires the Secretary and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to make fully interoperable the data systems used under the program. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on progress toward implementing these provisions. Establishes a three-year validity period for Visas Mantis security checks and revalidations. Permits revalidations in the United States. Allows multiple entries on a nonimmigrant visa for which a security check is required. Makes security checks valid across changes in nonimmigrant classifications. Creates an exception for national security concerns as determined by the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to submit annual reports on the Visas Mantis program to Congress."
