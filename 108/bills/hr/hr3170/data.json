Includes as an eligible business development company, also for such purposes, an investment company: (1) without any such class of equity securities; or (2) that is not an eligible portfolio company because the aggregate value of its outstanding publicly traded equity securities is more than $250 million but not more than $500 million, as long as such securities represent no more than ten percent of the total invested assets of the company."
