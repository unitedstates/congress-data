    "text": "Discretionary Spending Control Act of 2004 - Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to: (1) revise for FY 2004 discretionary spending limits (spending caps) for the highway and mass transit categories; (2) set forth for FY 2005 and 2006 new budget authority and outlays for the general purpose discretionary category, outlays for the highway category and new budget authority and outlays for the mass transit category; and (3) set forth for FY 2007 through 2009 outlays for the highway category and new budget authority and outlays for the mass transit category. Revises the requirement that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) make adjustments to the highway category to conform to estimated levels of highway receipts. Sets forth the level of obligation limitations (sum of budget authority and obligation limitations) for the highway and mass transit categories for FY 2004 through 2009. Provides that, in any of FY 2005 through 2006, discretionary advance appropriations provided in appropriation Acts in excess of $23,558 billion shall be counted against the discretionary spending limits for the fiscal year for which the appropriation Act containing the advance appropriation is enacted. Provides, under specified conditions, for additional new budget authority in FY 2005 or 2005 for fire suppression and for an adjustment in the discretionary spending limit for FY 2005 for supplemental appropriations for the global war on terrorism. Requires the estimates set forth in the discretionary sequestration preview and final reports issued by OMB and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to include the current year and each subsequent year through FY 2006 (or FY 2009 solely to enforce the discretionary spending limits for the highway and mass transit categories). Extends certain budget enforcement requirements through FY 2006 (or 2009 for enforcing the spending caps for the highway and mass transit categories)."
