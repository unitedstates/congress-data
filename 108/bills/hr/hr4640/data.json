Provides, until the taking effect of the first reapportionment occurring after the regular decennial census conducted for 2010, that: (1) the membership of the House shall be increased by two Members; and (2) each such Representative shall be in addition to such current membership; and (3) the State identified by the Clerk of the House in a specified report by the President to Congress shall be entitled to one additional Representative. Prohibits the temporary increase from: (1) increasing or decreasing the permanent membership of the House; (2) affecting the basis of reappointment established by Federal law; or (3) being taken into account in determining the number of electors with respect to the 2004 Presidential election. Amends the District of Columbia Delegate Act to repeal the office of District of Columbia Delegate. Amends the District of Columbia Statehood Constitutional Convention Initiative of 1979 to repeal the office of Statehood Representative."
