    "text": "Domestic Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2004 - Directs the Attorney General to award grants to States and political subdivisions to establish model law enforcement programs that promote the effective prosecution of purchasers, exploiters, and traffickers of commercial sex acts. Permits the use of grant funds for: (1) prosecutions against purchasers of unlawful commercial sex acts, including through the use of female decoys; (2) prosecutions against traffickers and exploiters of unlawful commercial sex acts, including through surveillance of places of business engaged in such acts; and (3) social service programs operated by non-governmental organizations with special expertise in assisting victims of unlawful commercial sex activities, whose programs offer protection, education, food, and shelter for victims. Amends the Federal criminal code to increase penalties for purchasers of unlawful commercial sex acts. Requires the Departments of Justice (DOJ), Labor, Health and Human Services, and any other Federal agency involved in combating unlawful domestic sex trafficking and providing services to the victims to coordinate their activities with the Senior Policy Operating Group to ensure that Federal programs directed at domestic trafficking are consistent with Federal enforcement of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. Requires the Attorney General to: (1) disseminate best practices for training State and local law enforcement personnel at each annual conference conducted by DOJ; and (2) carry out a biennial comprehensive statistical review and analysis of unlawful commercial sex acts."
