    "text": "Endangered Species Recovery Act of 2004 - Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to redefine \"endangered species\" as any species in danger of extinction throughout all of its global range, subject to existing exceptions. Requires the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) to identify from among endangered or threatened species the 109 species in greatest danger of extinction and to publish a list of such species (in lieu of listing all endangered or threatened species). Limits the Secretary of Commerce's requested listings to the 109 species. Prohibits the Secretary from listing species absent approval by majority vote of a panel comprised of the Secretary, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Secretary of Defense. Limits the listing period to five years. Eliminates the requirement that the Secretary identify endangered and threatened species \"solely\" on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available. Requires prior notification to landowners if a species to be listed occurs on private land. Limits prohibitions regarding endangered species to the 109 species identified under this Act. Requires the Secretary to complete review of habitat conservation plans seeking permission for otherwise prohibited takings within 180 days. Requires the Secretary to: (1) implement a species conservation reserve program under which eligible land is enrolled through the use of contracts to assist owners and operators in conserving endangered species; (2 bear the cost of conservation measures set forth in such contracts; and (3) pay rent to compensate for the loss in agricultural value of subject property."
