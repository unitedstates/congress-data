Eliminates authority for the Secretary to make additional grants to: (1) assist communities with technical assistance, replication of successful projects, and State policy formation to reduce infant and maternal mortality and morbidity; and (2) conduct and support research and to provide additional health care services for pregnant woman and infants."
