Increases the maximum rate of locality pay for CAB members to level III of the Executive Schedule (currently level IV). Specifies that administrative appeals judges (AAJs) are eligible for locality pay. (Sec. 5) Sets forth effective dates for purposes of computing increases in pay under this Act. (Sec. 6) Requires the Office of Personnel Management to submit a report to the House Government Reform Committee and the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee within six months of enactment of this Act that contains: (1) a list of Executive Schedule positions and the rates of basic pay for and total number of individuals occupying those positions; (2) a comparison of the rates of basic pay for ALJs, AAJs, and CAB members with those applicable to Executive Schedule positions and specified Federal judges; (3) a determination of whether rates of basic pay for ALJs, AAJs, and CAB members are incongruous with the compared positions; (4) a recommendation on the extent to which rates of basic pay for Executive Schedule positions should be adjusted; and (5) any other information or recommendations pertinent to Executive Schedule positions."
