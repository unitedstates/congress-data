Directs Secretary to require the system sponsor to submit updated environmental data, reports, permits, and impact analyses as necessary to develop detailed terms, conditions, and compliance plans. (Sec. 381) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) an Alaska natural gas transportation project would provide significant economic benefits to the United States and Canada; and (2) to maximize those benefits, the sponsors of the project should make every effort to use steel that is manufactured in North America and to negotiate a project labor agreement to expedite construction of the pipeline. (Sec. 382) Expresses the sense of Congress that an Alaska natural gas transportation project should maximize the participation of small business concerns in contracts and subcontracts awarded in carrying it out. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the extent to which small business concerns participate in the construction of oil and gas pipelines in the United States.
