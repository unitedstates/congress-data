Directs the Secretary of Energy to prescribe regulations for criteria and procedures governing renewable energy systems. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to direct the Secretary to evaluate the use of renewable energy systems in residential buildings. Amends the Biomass Energy and Alcohol Fuels Act of 1980 to redefine biomass. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow as a credit against tax, for both individuals and small businesses, 20 percent of the qualified renewable energy system expenditures during the taxable year."
