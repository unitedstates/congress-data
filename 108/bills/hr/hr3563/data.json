Directs the Attorney General to: (1) establish an outreach program to work with State and local law enforcement officials to harmonize the reporting of data on cargo theft; and (2) disseminate cargo theft information to appropriate law enforcement officials. Limits disclosure of reports and data under the Freedom of Information Act. Expands the scope of prohibitions against: (1) interstate or foreign shipments by carrier to include trailers and air cargo containers; and (2) the transportation and sale of stolen vehicles to include vessels."
