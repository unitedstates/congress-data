Includes under such coverage mammograms, clinical breast examinations, pap tests and pelvic examinations, colorectal screening procedures, and prostate screening tests, at specified intervals and through specified procedures for certain age groups in appropriate genders. Sets forth provisions requiring the disclosure of benefits and health care provider information to patients under such plan or coverage. Prohibits related eligibility discrimination, monetary incentives to individuals, and penalties or incentives to providers. Amends PHSA to apply the requirements of this Act to coverage offered in the individual market. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, on the Secretary's own initiative or upon petition by an individual or organization, to modify coverage requirements provided under this Act to allow such requirements to incorporate new scientific and technological advances, practice pattern changes, or other updated medical practices regarding cancer screening. Makes applicable to Federal Government employees' health insurance this Act's standards relating to coverage of cancer screening and patient access to information."
