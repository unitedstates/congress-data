    "text": "Oceans Conservation, Education, and National Strategy for the 21st Century Act - Specifies a national oceans policy. Establishes national standards to require any Federal agency or federally funded activities that affect U.S. ocean waters or ocean resources to be conducted in a manner that protects and maintains healthy marine ecosystems and, where appropriate, restores degraded marine ecosystems. Re-establishes in the Department of Commerce (what already exists under Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), administered by the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere. Directs the President to submit to Congress recommendations for reorganizing functions of existing Federal agencies to establish a Department of Natural Resources having authority for Federal programs relating to land, air, and water resources, including freshwater and ocean resources. Establishes: (1) a National Oceans Advisor; (2) a National Oceans Council; and (3) the Council of Advisors on Oceans Policy. Designates certain ocean regions for ecosystem-based management. Establishes a NOAA Regional Office and a Regional Ocean Council for each ocean region. Requires each Regional Ocean Council to prepare a Regional Ocean Ecosystem Plan for each ocean region. Establishes a Committee on Ocean Science, Education, and Operations (OSEO Committee). Directs the Chair of the National Oceans Council to develop a National Strategy for Ocean and Coastal Science. Establishes: (1) a Subcommittee on Ocean Education within the OSEO Committee; (2) an interagency ocean and coastal education program; (3) a National Ocean Science and Technology Scholarship Program; and (4) a NOAA Office of Education. Directs the Administrator to conduct a national media campaign to increase public awareness and interest in the oceans, through mass media advertising. Establishes: (1) an Office of Ocean Exploration within the Ocean and Atmospheric Research and Data Services Office; and (2) a Subcommittee on Ocean Exploration within the OSEO Committee. Establishes in the Treasury the Ocean and Great Lakes Conservation Trust Fund."
