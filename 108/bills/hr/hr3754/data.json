Amends the Federal criminal code to require the maximum imprisonment otherwise provided for a felony offense to be doubled or increased by seven years, whichever is less, if the defendant knowingly falsely registers a domain name and uses that domain name in the course of the felony offense. Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review and amend sentencing guidelines with respect to a conviction for the false registration and use of a domain name during the course of a felony offense."
