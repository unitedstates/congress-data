Makes it unlawful for a person to transmit to a protected computer any software that includes a function to deliver or display advertisements, unless notice is provided to, and consent is received from, the owner or operator. Provides for enforcement of such prohibitions through: (1) the Federal Trade Commission; (2) criminal proceedings; or (3) State actions on behalf of its residents. Requires semiannual reports from the Attorney General to the congressional judiciary committees concerning actions on warrants or other orders applied for by law enforcement agencies whose implementation involved the transmission or execution of computer software on a protected computer to record computer activity or to intercept any wire, oral, or electronic communications."
