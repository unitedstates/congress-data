    "text": "Veterans Earn and Learn Act of 2004 - Title I: Education Matters - (Sec. 102) Charges the Montgomery GI Bill veterans' educational assistance entitlement for each month that an eligible veteran is paid a job training assistance allowance through the Department of Veterans Affairs. Increases such charge for any month in which the veteran fails to complete 120 hours of such training. (Sec. 103) Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (Secretary) to pay a lump-sum incentive payment to an individual who successfully completes a full-time program of job apprenticeship under the Montgomery GI Bill program before his or her assistance allowance is exhausted, including under the educational assistance programs for: (1) the post-Vietnam era; (2) survivors and dependents; and (3) the Selected Reserve. (Sec. 104) Increases the assistance payable under such educational assistance programs for each month in which an individual pursuing a full-time program of apprenticeship or other on-job training is also enrolled in a course of classroom instruction related to such training: (1) from 75 to 85 percent of the institutional rate, for the first six months of such instruction; (2) from 55 to 65 percent, for the second six months; and (3) from 35 to 45 percent, for the third six months. (Sec. 105) Allows an apprenticeship to be determined upon a specific period of time (time-based program) or upon the successful mastery of a skill (competency-based program). Directs State approving agencies, when determining the period of a competency-based program, to consider the approximate program term recommended in registered apprenticeship program standards recognized by the Secretary of Labor. Requires: (1) the Secretary of Labor to notify the Secretary upon the successful completion of an apprenticeship program by a veteran or other eligible person; and (2) the sponsor of a job training program to also provide such notification. Provides funding for FY 2005 for computer system modifications necessitated by the above amendments.
