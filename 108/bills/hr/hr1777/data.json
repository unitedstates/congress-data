Directs the Secretary, in partnership with the private sector, to facilitate the deployment of: (1) hydrogen energy and energy infrastructure; (2) fuel cells; (3) advanced vehicle technologies; and (4) clean fuels in addition to hydrogen. Directs the President to establish an interagency task force chaired by the Secretary to work toward the specified goals of this Act. Establishes the Hydrogen Technical and Fuel Cell Advisory Committee to advise the Secretary on programs and activities. Mandates review of the implementation plan by a competitively selected nongovernmental entity, such as the National Academy of Sciences."
