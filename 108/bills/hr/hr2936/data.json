Modifies provisions pertaining to criminal penalties for committing certain prohibited acts involving food, drugs, devices, or cosmetics.

Makes a second violation, or a violation committed with intent to defraud or mislead, punishable by a fine in accordance with Federal law, imprisonment for not more than three years, or both.
