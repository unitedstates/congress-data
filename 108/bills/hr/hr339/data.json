Requires: (1) a stay of discovery during the pendency of a motion to dismiss an action described in clause 1 or 2 above, unless necessary to preserve evidence or to prevent undue prejudice; and (2) document preservation during the stay. Requires the complaint in an action described in clause 1 above to plead with particularity the Federal and State statutes that were allegedly violated and the facts that are alleged to have proximately caused the injury claimed."
