Requires the Secretary to enter into an agreement to transfer the bridge to the City of Folsom which shall assume full responsibility for its operation and maintenance. States that the bridge shall be constructed at full Federal expense if it is a two-lane bridge, but that if it is a four-lane bridge the City of Folsom shall be required to contribute 20 percent of the cost of construction. Authorizes appropriations."
