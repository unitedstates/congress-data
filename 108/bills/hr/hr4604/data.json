    "text": "Protecting Railroads against Enemy Efforts through Modernization, Planning, and Technology Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Border and Transportation Security, to develop a national railroad transportation security plan that identifies threats and vulnerabilities to the Nation's railroads and provides a plan for increased security. Directs the Secretary to develop prioritized recommendations for improving railroad security, including: (1) the security of rail tunnels and bridges and other rail infrastructure and facilities; (2) deployment of equipment to detect explosives and hazardous chemical, biological, and radioactive substances; (3) installation of redundant and backup systems to ensure continued operation in the event of a terrorist attack; and (4) deployment of surveillance equipment. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to railroads, hazardous materials shippers, owners of rail cars used in transportation of hazardous materials, universities, colleges, and research centers, and State and local governments for reimbursement of costs incurred to prevent or respond to acts of terrorism, sabotage, or other railroad security threats. Authorizes the Secretary to procure fire and life-safety improvements to the tunnels on the Northeast Corridor in New York, New York, Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. Directs the Secretary to review existing Department of Transportation (DOT) rail regulations to identify areas in which those regulations need to be revised to improve railroad security."
