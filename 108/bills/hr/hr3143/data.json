    "as": "Reported to House amended, Part II", 
    "date": "2004-11-16", 
    "text": "International Consumer Protection Act of 2004 - (Sec. 2) Amends the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA) to define \"foreign law enforcement agency\" as: (1) any agency or judicial authority of a foreign government that is vested with law enforcement or investigative authority in civil, criminal, or administrative matters; and (2) any multinational or multiagency organization to the extent it is acting on behalf of such an entity. (Sec. 3) Defines \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" to include acts or practices involving foreign commerce that: (1) cause or are likely to cause reasonably foreseeable injury within the United States; or (2) involve material conduct occurring within the United States. Makes available to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with respect to such acts or practices in foreign commerce all remedies it uses in domestic commerce, including restitution to domestic or foreign victims. (Sec. 4) Authorizes the FTC to reveal to foreign law enforcement agencies privileged or confidential business information obtained from any person during the course of its investigations upon prior certification that such information will be maintained in confidence and will be used only for official law enforcement purposes and subject to other restrictions. Sets forth new FTC powers, including authority to: (1) provide investigative assistance for foreign law enforcement agencies; and (2) refer to the Department of Justice evidence of conduct that may constitute a violation of Federal criminal law. Requires the FTC to endeavor to ensure that material obtained from foreign law enforcement agencies may be used for investigating, prosecuting, or preventing violations of U.S. criminal laws. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 5) Authorizes FTC attorneys to assist the Attorney General in foreign litigation on matters in which the FTC has an interest. (Sec. 6) Authorizes the FTC to share documentary material, results of inspections of tangible things, written reports or answers to questions, and transcripts of oral testimony received pursuant to compulsory process or investigation with foreign law enforcement agencies upon prior certification of an appropriate foreign law enforcement agency official that such material will be maintained in confidence and used only for official law enforcement purposes, if: (1) the foreign law enforcement agency has set forth a bona fide legal basis for its authority to maintain confidentiality; (2) the materials are to be used to investigate, or to engage in enforcement proceedings related to specified laws; (3) the appropriate Federal banking agency or the National Credit Union Administration has given prior approval (if requested in connection with possible violations of banking, savings and loan, or Federal credit union laws); and (4) the foreign law enforcement agency is not from a country determined to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism. (Sec. 7) Applies to the FTC the procedures for delay of notification or prohibition of disclosure under the Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA) and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act where a court or the FTC finds that notification may cause an adverse result. Authorizes the FTC, where neither notification nor delayed notification are required, to apply ex parte for a court order prohibiting the recipient of compulsory process issued by the FTC from disclosing to any other person the existence of such process. Authorizes: (1) all judicial proceedings initiated by the FTC under RFPA or this section to be brought in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or other appropriate U.S. District Court; and (2) all ex parte applications by the FTC under this section relating to a single investigation to be brought in a single proceeding. Requires all proceedings under this section, upon application by the FTC, to be held in camera and the records sealed. (Sec. 8) Sets forth guidelines for the protection of specified entities who volunteer information, including consumer complaints, to the FTC. (Sec. 9) Permits the temporary exchange of staff between the FTC and foreign government agencies in order to facilitate implementation of this Act. (Sec. 10) Amends RFPA to permit the FTC to exchange information with specified financial regulators. (Sec. 11) States that the authority provided by this Act, FTCA, and RFPA is in addition to any other authority vested in the FTC or other officers of the United States. (Sec. 12) Requires the FTC to report to Congress on its use of and experience with the authority granted by this Act."
