    "text": "Terrorism Against Animal-Use Entities Prohibition Improvement Act of 2004 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit: (1) travel or use of the mail or any facility in interstate or foreign commerce for purposes of causing economic disruption to an animal enterprise; and (2) intentionally using threats, acts of vandalism, property damage, trespass, persistent and harassing communications, intimidation, or coercion in furtherance of a plan to cause economic disruption to that enterprise. (Current law covers physical disruption but not economic disruption.) Increases penalties for economic damage. Sets penalties for economic damage or disruption exceeding $100,000. Provides for imposition of the death penalty where a person causes the death of an individual in the course of a violation of code provisions regarding animal enterprise terrorism. Includes animal enterprise terrorism within the scope of offenses for which interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications is authorized."
