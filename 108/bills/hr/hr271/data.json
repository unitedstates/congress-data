Directs the Secretary to evaluate the effects of such modifications on the regional allocation of funds available to the Department of Veterans Affairs for health care and, if the modifications do not result in a substantive shift in such allocations, to terminate VERA.Directs the Secretary, if required to terminate VERA, to develop a new formula for the allocation of funds to the Department's national service regions, known as Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs), that takes into account specified requirements, including additional costs incurred by a VISN because the age of veterans, or the number of veterans requiring complex care, in that VISN exceeds the median for all VISNs.Authorizes additional appropriations to be allocated to VISNs that have experienced funding reductions."
