Establishes a foreign language proficiency requirement for certain senior level positions in the Central Intelligence Agency. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) and the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) jointly to establish a program for the advancement of foreign language skills in languages critical to the intelligence community's national security activities. Authorizes heads of elements of the intelligence community, in carrying out the program, to: (1) enter into education partnership agreements with U.S. educational institutions to encourage and enhance the study of critical foreign languages; and (2) accept from dedicated personnel voluntary services in support of the program. Authorizes the DCI, acting through the heads of elements of the intelligence community, to assign certain employees of such elements as foreign language students at accredited institutions of higher education. Requires the DCI to conduct a pilot project to establish a Civilian Linguist Reserve Corps of U.S. citizens with advanced foreign language proficiency. Clarifies the functions of the National Virtual Translation Center. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study and report to appropriate congressional committees on methods to improve the recruitment and retention of qualified foreign language instructors at the Foreign Language Center of the Defense Language Institute."
