Prohibits any school or local educational agency (LEA) from being identified for or subject to certain requirements of school improvement, corrective action, or restructuring for any year for which appropriations are less than 97 percent of specified amounts in each of FY 2005 through 2007 to carry out ESEA title I (Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged) part A (Improving Basic Programs Operated by LEAs). Authorizes any State educational agency (SEA) to defer commencing, suspend implementing, or modify (but not cease developing) certain SEA and LEA requirements for teachers and paraprofessionals, for one year for each year for which appropriations are less than 97 percent of specified amounts in each of FY 2005 through 2007 to carry out ESEA title II (Preparing, Training, and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals) part A (Teacher and Principal Training and Recruiting Fund) subparts 1 through 4 (Grants to States; Subgrants to LEAs; Subgrants to Eligible Partnerships; Accountability)."
