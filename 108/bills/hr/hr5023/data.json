Advanced Education in Science and Technology Act - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to pay a monthly stipend to each individual who is entitled to veterans' basic educational assistance and is pursuing full-time a doctoral degree in the physical or natural sciences, engineering, mathematics, or other scientific or technology disciplines. Allows such payment in addition to any other authorized Montgomery GI Bill educational assistance. Makes such payment $1,200 a month (adjusted for inflation for fiscal years after 2005) for up to 60 months. Requires that such payments be disregarded by an institution of higher learning when determining any financial assistance that may be available to such doctoral candidate."
