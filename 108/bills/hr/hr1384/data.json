    "text": "Amends the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 with regard to certain increases compensating for mandatory reductions in the amount of an individual's railroad retirement annuity. Repeals the prohibition against taking into account during recertification of an annuity any persons not entitled to an annuity (except a spouse under certain circumstances), if at the time of initial certification: (1) all persons then eligible for such an annuity were considered for inclusion; and (2) the requirements for such increases were either inapplicable or applicable but later became inapplicable. (Thus allows such otherwise ineligible persons to be taken into account when an annuity is recertified with respect to such increases compensating for mandatory reductions.)"
