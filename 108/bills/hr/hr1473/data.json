Prescribes disclosure requirements, including disclosure of the relationship between the use of insurance credit scores or other risk scores or predictors. Directs the Federal Trade Commission to: (1) promulgate requirements for insurers to submit specified insurance credit score information to the Commission; and (2) investigate and report to Congress on the relationship between credit information and insurance credit scores and the race, income, geographic location, and age of insurance applicants and policyholders. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of this Act."
