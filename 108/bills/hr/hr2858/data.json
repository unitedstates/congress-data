Defines (as components of \"material support or resources\") \"training\" to mean instruction or teaching designed to impart a specific skill and \"personnel\" to include oneself. Prohibits prosecuting a person in connection with providing \"personnel\" unless that person has knowingly provided, attempted to provide, or conspired to provide a terrorist organization with one or more individuals (who may be or include himself) to work in concert with the organization or under its direction or control."
