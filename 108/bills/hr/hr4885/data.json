    "text": "Comprehensive Immigration Fairness Act - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to make permanently available the exception to the adjustment of status bar for beneficiaries of family petitions or labor certification applications. Adds grounds for discretionary waiver of inadmissibility. Authorizes K nonimmigrant status for specified family members of lawful permanent residents (LPRs) and additional family members of U.S. citizens who are awaiting immigrant visas. Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) to disregard as aggravated felonies (with immigration consequences) certain criminal convictions. Provides that a person who is a child on the last day of the 90-day period after a pending application for INA benefits is filed shall be considered to be a child for all purposes related to such application. Clarifies that the term \"child\" includes children for whom adoption proceedings were initiated prior to specified ages. Authorizes the Secretary to waive certain bars to admission. Establishes a program for earned access to legalization. Authorizes the adjustment of status of certain undocumented children. Amends the registry provision. Expands the list of unfair immigration-related employment practices. Requires petitioners for nonimmigrant workers to file affidavits describing efforts to recruit U.S. citizens or LPRs. Doubles the numerical cap on worldwide diversity immigrant visas. Provides for adjustment of status of certain Haitian nationals. Eliminates mandatory detention in asylum seekers' expedited removal proceedings. Amends the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 1998 to remove document fraud as a ground of inadmissibility and to address child-related determinations. Provides for adjustment of status of certain Liberian nationals. Modifies requirements applicable to asylum and refugee proceedings. Authorizes adjustment of status for certain recipients of temporary protected status. Repeals a provision in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 that bars Federal, State, and local governments from preventing the communication of immigration status information to the Department of Homeland Security. Repeals a provision of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 concerning verification of eligibility for Federal public benefits. Eliminates statutory authority permitting State personnel to carry out immigration officer functions."
