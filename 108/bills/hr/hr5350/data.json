Requires the Secretary to ensure that such curricula focus on preventive health measures, including : (1) education on the causes, treatment, and prevention of obesity; (2) office education and counseling to ensure an appropriate diet for mostly healthy people; (3) prevention and treatment of common nutritional deficiencies; (4) the appropriate and inappropriate use of herbs and supplements; (5) office recognition and treatment of common eating disorders; and (6) identification of special dietary needs, eating disorders, and appropriate routes of referral for medical nutrition therapy. Requires grantees to: (1) develop innovative curricula; (2) integrate such curricula into the medical education at the school; (3) evaluate the results achieved with the curricula; (4) establish a multidisciplinary planning committee to develop the curricula; and (5) report to the Secretary on the developed curricula and results achieved. Requires the Secretary to prepare a consolidated report on the curricula and results achieved by grantees and to disseminate such report to schools of medicine."
