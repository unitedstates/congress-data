    "text": "Rural Disaster Assistance Fairness Act of 2003 - Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to revise the declaration that no geographic area shall be precluded from receiving assistance under such Act solely by virtue of an arithmetic formula or sliding scale based on income or population. Directs the President to establish in the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) an Office of Rural Advocacy headed by a Director who shall be an advocate for the fair treatment of rural communities in the provision of assistance under such Act. Requires the Director to: (1) participate in the disaster and the emergency declaration processes to ensure that the needs of rural communities are being addressed; (2) assist small population States in the preparation of requests for major disaster or emergency declarations; and (3) review all rules and regulations relating to the provision of assistance under such Act to ensure that rural communities receive fair and equitable treatment. Requires the Director of FEMA to promulgate a rule to ensure that the factors used to review a Governor's request for a major disaster or an emergency declaration under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act adequately address the needs of States with a population of less than one million individuals and the rural communities in those States."
