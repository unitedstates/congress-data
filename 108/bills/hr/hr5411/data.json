    "text": "Iran Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to prohibit granting any license, approval, or authorization for the export, re-export, transfer, or retransfer of specified components and facilities to a country that the President determines has provided to the Islamic Republic of Iran special nuclear material, source material, byproduct material, production facility, utilization facility, or items, components, or technologies which can be used in a production or utilization facility or in a nuclear explosive device. Cites exceptions and defines circumstances under which the President is authorized to waive such prohibition. Declares the prohibition inapplicable to any license, approval, or authorization which the President determines is necessary to implement the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs. Directs the President to report to Congress on efforts by Iran to acquire nuclear explosives and delivery vehicles, including actions by foreign countries or entities to provide Iran with nuclear materials, technology, and missiles."
