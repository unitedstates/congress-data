    "text": "Joint Administrative Procedures Committee Act of 2003 (JAPC Act) - Establishes a Joint Administrative Procedures Committee to selectively review existing major rules of Federal agencies and recommend amendment or repeal of such rules. Directs the Committee to periodically review the regulatory plan of each agency of its most important significant regulatory actions that the agency reasonably expects to issue in proposed or final form in the fiscal year in which the plan is submitted. Makes it in order for any Member of the House, after the third legislative day after the date on which the committee to which a joint resolution is referred has reported, to move to proceed to consideration of a joint resolution. Waives all points of order against the motion to proceed and against consideration of that motion. Makes the motion privileged in the House and not debatable. Provides that: (1) the motion is not subject to amendment, to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to proceed to the consideration of other business; and (2) debate in the House shall not exceed one hour. Provides that: (1) before a rule can take effect, the Federal agency promulgating the rule shall submit to each house of Congress and to the Comptroller General a report to the Committee; and (2) within a specified time frame, the Committee may report a committee resolution recommending that each standing committee with jurisdiction to which copies of the applicable report were provided report a joint resolution disapproving the applicable rule."
