    "date": "2004-07-13", 
    "text": "AGOA Acceleration Act of 2004 - (Sec. 4) Declares the sense of Congress that the preferential market access opportunities for eligible sub-Saharan African countries (SSA countries) will be complemented and enhanced if those countries implement specified existing obligations under the World Trade Organization (WTO). Urges such countries to participate in and support mutual trade liberalization in ongoing negotiations under WTO auspices, recognizing that such commitments may need to reflect special and differential treatment for developing countries. States that eligible SSA countries will benefit from reduction of trade barriers in other developing countries. Urges all countries to make sanitary and phytosanitary decisions on the basis of sound science. (Sec. 5) Expresses the sense of Congress that the executive branch, including specified Federal agencies, should enforce African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) provisions relating to preferential treatment of textile and apparel articles broadly in order to expand trade by maximizing opportunities for imports of such articles from eligible SSA countries. (Sec. 7) Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to extend duty-free treatment for AGOA articles through FY 2015. Modifies AGOA rules of origin to add to the inputs calculation for duty-free treatment former beneficiary SSA countries (defined as former SSA countries whose designation ceased by reason of entering into a free trade agreement with the United States). Authorizes preferential treatment under the AGOA for apparel articles made from regional fabrics or yarns even if they include U.S. components. Extends preferential treatment for such articles and establishes applicable percentages for benefits. Identifies as eligible for preferential treatment apparel made from fabrics or yarns listed in Annex 401 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) without regard to the origin of the fabrics or yarns. (Currently, such fabrics or yarns must be manufactured in the United States or in a beneficiary SSA country.)
