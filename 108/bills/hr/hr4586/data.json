Amends the Trademark Act of 1946 to protect from liability for trademark infringement: (1) persons who engage in the above-referenced conduct; and (2) manufacturers, licensees, or licensors of technology that enables content to be rendered imperceptible. Requires such manufacturers, licensees, or licensors to ensure that the technology provides notice that performance of the movie is altered from the director's or copyright holder's intended performance. Establishes civil penalties for manufacturers who fail to provide the requisite notice."
