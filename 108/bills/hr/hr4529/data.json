    "text": "Arctic Coastal Plain and Surface Mining Improvement Act of 2004 - Arctic Coastal Plain Domestic Energy Security Act of 2004 - Sets forth an oil and gas leasing exploration and production program within the Arctic Coastal Plain. Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 to repeal its prohibition against production of oil and gas from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, including any leasing or development leading to such production.. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) designate a maximum total of Coastal Plain acreage as a \"Special Area\" of unique character and interest; and (2) permit the use of horizontal drilling technology from lease sites located outside a Special Area. Prescribes Coastal Plain environmental protection requirements. Abandoned Mine Lands Reclamation Reform Act of 2004 - Amends the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 to repeal the authorization that certain moneys in the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund be used: (1) by the Secretary of Agriculture for reclamation of rural lands; and (2) by the Department of the Interior for studies by contract with organizations for advice and research and development projects technical assistance. Reduces the reclamation fee required to be paid by operators of coal mining operations. Revises requirements governing the transfer of funds to the United Mine Workers of America Combined Benefit (UMWACB) Fund. Revises certification guidelines to prescribe payments to qualified and non-qualified States and Indian tribes. Establishes in the Treasury the Coal Mining Fairness Fund. Appropriates to such Fund certain bonuses, rents, or royalties proceeds received by the United States from the exploration, development, and production of the oil and gas resources of the Coastal Plain. Prescribes guidelines for payments from such Fund to the UMWACB Fund. Amends the Internal Revenue Code (relating to liability of assigned operators) to: (1) waive payment by coal operators of any premium to the Combined Benefit Fund to the extent of the premium amount paid to the Coal Mining Fairness Fund; and (2) set guidelines governing prepayment to the Combined Benefit Fund of premium liability for coal industry health benefits."
