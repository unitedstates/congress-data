    "text": "Anti-Terrorism Intelligence Tools Improvement Act of 2003 - Amends the Federal criminal code to provide for imprisonment for not more than one year for knowingly violating nondisclosure provisions under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, or the National Security Act of 1947, and for imprisonment for not more than five years if the violation is committed with the intent to obstruct an investigation or judicial proceeding. Authorizes the Attorney General, in the case of a refusal to comply with a request for records, a report, or other information made to any person under those Acts, to invoke the aid of any U.S. court with jurisdiction to compel compliance. Amends the Classified Information Procedures Act to require (current law allows) the court to permit the United States to request authorization to delete specified items of classified information from documents to be made available to the defendant through discovery, to substitute a summary of the information for such classified documents, or to substitute a statement admitting relevant facts that the classified information would tend to prove. Amends the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to: (1) include individuals who engage in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor as agents of foreign powers; and (2) make an exception to specified notification procedures in cases involving surveillance in civil proceedings or other civil matters under the immigration laws."
