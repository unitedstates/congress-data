    "text": "Intermodal Transportation Act of 2003 - Amends Federal transportation law to establish an intermodal transportation facilities program in which the Secretary of Transportation shall make grants on a competitive basis to public or private entities to finance projects for the construction, reconstruction, maintenance, repair, and renovation of facilities designed and operated to promote the intermodal transportation of passengers. Sets forth grant and project eligibility requirements. Sets the Federal share of project costs at no more than 90 percent. Directs the Secretary to carry out a program to promote essential intercity bus and commercial van service by private operators between non-urbanized and small urban areas and primary airports, including intermediate points. Amends the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century to set forth funding levels for grants to operators of over-the-road buses to increase accessibility for persons with disabilities under the rural transportation accessibility incentive program. Establishes a national public transportation information system to provide for all public and private providers of scheduled passenger transportation service over fixed routes information on service, fares, schedules, and availability of service accessible to persons with disabilities. Makes costs associated with the mass transportation, intercity bus, or intercity rail components of facility projects intended to enhance coordinating mass transportation with other transportation eligible for discretionary mass transportation grants and loans."
