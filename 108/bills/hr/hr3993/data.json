(Current law applies such requirements to farm-raised and wild fish as of such date, and other covered commodities as of September 30, 2006.) Requires a retailer to maintain country-of-origin records for at least 180 days. Provides for the future inclusion of national animal identification system information into the certification of origin requirements. Revises civil money penalty provisions for country-of-origin notice violations."
