Establishes the World Trade Organizations (WTO) Settlement Review Commission. Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to place restrictions on export-import bank assistance and on the overseas private investment corporation. Sets forth a period for the President to negotiate with the governments of countries that engage most egregiously in currency manipulation, in order to seek a prompt and orderly end to such manipulation and ensure the free trade of such currencies on international currency markets. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to redefine: (1) \"domestic\" to treat the acquiring corporation in a corporate expatriation transaction as a domestic corporation; and (2) \" foreign base company income\" to include such company's U.S. import income for a taxable year. Denies treaty benefits for certain deductible foreign payments. Repeals the exclusion of extraterritorial income from gross income. Provides for a phased-in deduction for income attributable to certain domestic production activities. Sets forth requirements for waivers of the Buy American Act.
