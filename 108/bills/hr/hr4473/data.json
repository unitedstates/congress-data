    "text": "Educational Opportunity for the 21st Century Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2005 - Makes appropriations for the Department of Education for FY 2005. Includes specified amounts for various programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998, Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Assistive Technology Act of 1998, Helen Keller National Center Act, Education of the Deaf Act of 1986, and other education laws. Prohibits the Secretary of Education from implementing or enforcing for award year 2005-2006 any annual update to an allowance for State and other taxes in HEA need analysis to determine students' expected family contributions. Provides for additional amounts for specified ESEA programs for disadvantaged students to be available for those local educational agencies that would otherwise receive, under the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2004, smaller allocations for FY 2004 than FY 2003. Reduces by 55.7 percent the tax reduction for taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes above $1,000,000 for 2004 resulting from enactment of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 and the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001."
