(Makes exceptions for specified governmental conduct.) Amends the Atomic Energy Act to expand the scope of provisions governing atomic weapons to prohibit transferring or receiving in interstate or foreign commerce, using, or possessing and threatening to use an atomic weapon. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) when such prohibited conduct shall be considered to have occurred within the jurisdiction of the United States; and (2) applicable criminal penalties, including the death penalty. Expands the scope of Arms Export Control Act licensing provisions and Federal criminal code provisions regarding interception of communications, acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries, and money laundering to cover offenses under this Act."
