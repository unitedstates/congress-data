Requires half of the required outlay reductions to come from non-exempt defense accounts and half to come from non-exempt non-defense accounts. Provides decreasing maximum deficit amounts for FY 2005 and thereafter, with a zero balance for FY 2012 and beyond. Requires adjustment of the maximum deficit in the event of negative Federal revenue growth. Provides discretionary spending limits for FY 2005 through 2013.
