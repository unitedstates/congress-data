Requires three consecutive complete school years of full-time teaching in a public elementary or secondary school as: (1) a secondary school teacher of a subject area relevant to the borrower's academic major; or (2) an elementary school teacher who has demonstrated knowledge and teaching skills in reading, writing, mathematics, and other curriculum areas. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from a teacher's gross income any student loan amounts discharged under both the current HEA programs and those added by this Act."
