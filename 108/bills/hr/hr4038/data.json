Directs the Attorney General to carry out a pilot program, known as the Law Enforcement Analyst Training Assistance Program, to assess providing for the preparation of selected students for employment as intelligence analysts for U.S. law enforcement agencies. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to direct that not less than 25 percent of COPS program grant funds be made available for activities to: (1) increase the number of State and local law enforcement officers or employees involved in developing intelligence for countering terrorism, crime, or both; (2) provide specialized training to not more than five intelligence officers per grant recipient to enhance observational, intelligence-gathering, foreign language, and analytical skills; (3) improve Federal-State-local law enforcement coordination; and (4) ensure that not less than one intelligence officer per grant recipient has at least a \"top secret\" level security clearance."
