    "text": "Air Cargo Security Act - Amends Federal aviation law to require the screening of cargo that is to be transported in passenger aircraft operated by domestic and foreign air carriers in interstate and intrastate air transportation (currently, only those transported by all-cargo aircraft). Directs the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security under the Transportation Security Administration to develop a strategic plan to carry out such screening.Sets forth certain measures to increase the safety and security of air cargo, including the establishment of systems that: (1) provide for the regular inspection of shipping facilities for cargo shipments; (2) provide an industry-wide pilot program database of known cargo shippers; (3) train persons that handle air cargo to ensure that such cargo is properly handled and safe-guarded from security breaches; and (4) require air carriers operating all-cargo aircraft to have an approved plan for the security of their air operations area, the cargo placed aboard the aircraft, and persons having access to their aircraft on the ground or in flight.Directs the Under Secretary to conduct random audits, investigations, and inspections of indirect air carrier facilities to determine if the indirect air carriers are meeting the security requirements of this Act."
