Federal Communications Commission, et al. Directs the FCC to: (1) reinstate such rules; and (2) initiate a proceeding to consider whether it is economically and technically feasible and consistent with the public interest to include \"accessible information\" in such rules. Authorizes the FCC to amend, repeal, or otherwise modify such rules."
