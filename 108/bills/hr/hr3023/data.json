Instructs the Secretary to: (1) transmit to Congress, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Governor of each State in which a reserve will be sited a plan for the transportation of the contents of the GAS Reserve to consumers in the event of an emergency sale; and (2) complete the process of filling the GAS Reserve by March 1, 2006. Prescribes procedural guidelines for emergency sales by the Secretary from the GAS Reserve upon written request from the Governor of a State for GAS Reserve emergency sales assistance owing to a physical disruption in the gasoline supplies that is likely to result in price volatility for retail gasoline in the Governor's State. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct purchases and sales of gasoline at wholesale for maintenance of the GAS Reserve system."
