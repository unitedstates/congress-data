    "text": "Firearms Safety and Consumer Protection Act of 2003 - Directs the Attorney General to prescribe regulations governing the design, manufacture, and performance of, and commerce in, firearm products in order to reduce or prevent unreasonable risk of injury. Authorizes individuals to petition the Attorney General to issue or revise product regulations or to require the recall, repair, or replacement of, or the provision of refunds regarding, a firearm product. Authorizes the Attorney General to: (1) take such action; (2) prohibit the manufacture, sale, or transfer of firearm products made, imported, transferred, or distributed in violation of regulations; (3) prohibit the manufacture, importation, transfer, distribution, or export of unreasonably risky firearm products; and (4) conduct inspections. Sets forth prohibitions against a manufacturer: (1) transferring, distributing, or exporting a firearm product that the manufacturer has not tested and certified as conforming to such regulations or that is not appropriately labeled; (2) producing a new type of firearm product without providing notice to the Attorney General; or (3) failing to maintain records and supply information to the Attorney General. Prohibits any person from: (1) importing or exporting a firearm product that has not been so certified; or (2) manufacturing, purchasing, or importing products before regulations take effect at a greater rate than before enactment of this Act. Sets forth provisions regarding civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act. Authorizes: (1) injunctive enforcement and condemnation and seizure of qualified firearm products; (2) actions to restrain the manufacture or distribution of imminently hazardous products; and (3) private actions by persons aggrieved by violations of this Act or to enforce this Act. Directs the Attorney General : (1) in cooperation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to collect and share with other appropriate agencies circumstances of death and injury associated with firearms and to conduct continuing studies and investigations of economic costs and losses resulting from firearm-related deaths and injuries; (2) maintain firearms production and sales figures for licensed manufacturers; and (3) conduct research on firearm product safety and develop safety testing methods and devices."
