    "text": "Stem Cell Discovery Through Diversity Act - Requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), acting through the national research institutes, to conduct and support research that uses human embryonic stem cells in accordance with the final guidelines issued by NIH and published in the Federal Register on August 25, 2000, including: (1) the requirements that stem cells used in research be derived from human embryos that were created in vitro for fertility treatments and were in excess of the clinical needs of the individual seeking such treatment and that such individuals voluntarily donated such embryos with informed consent; and (2) the prohibition against the use of Federal funds to derive such cells from the embryos. Provides that restrictions on such research established by the Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to policies announced by the President on August 9, 2001, have no legal effect after enactment of this Act. Prohibits additional Federal administrative policies on such research from being established or applied. Requires the Director to ensure that such research program include a significant number of donations from individuals who are members of racial or ethnic minority groups in order to make progress toward the goal of developing an understanding of whether the variables studied in clinical research affect such groups differently. Requires the Director to establish the Ronald Reagan Office of Human Stem Cell Research to coordinate all research conducted or supported by NIH that used human pluripotent stem cells."
