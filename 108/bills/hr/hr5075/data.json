    "text": "Reentry Enhancement Act - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to reauthorize, rewrite, and expand provisions regarding adult and juvenile offender reentry demonstration projects, including by authorizing funds to: (1) provide structured post-release housing and transitional housing; (2) facilitate collaboration to promote the employment of people released from prison; and (3) establish or expand the use of reentry courts. Sets forth grant priorities and requirements, including that each State or local government recipient establish a Reentry Task Force or other relevant convening authority. Authorizes the Attorney General to make a grant to provide for the establishment of a National Adult and Juvenile Offender Reentry Resource Center. Establishes in the executive branch an interagency task force on Federal programs related to the reentry of former prisoners into the community, to be chaired by the Attorney General. Authorizes the National Institute of Justice and the Bureau of Justice Statistics to conduct research on offender reentry. Declares that the right of a U.S. citizen to vote in any election for Federal office shall not be denied or abridged because that individual has been convicted of a crime unless such individual is serving a felony sentence at the time of the election. Sets forth enforcement provisions. Requires the Bureau of Prisons to ensure that a prisoner serving a term of imprisonment spends a reasonable part of the final portion of that term preparing for reentry into the community."
