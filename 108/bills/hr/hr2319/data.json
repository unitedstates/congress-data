Modifies succession requirements relating to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore to specify, instead, persons holding the office of Speaker or President pro tempore at the time of the need for the succession. Provides that an individual acting as President shall continue to do so until the expiration of the then current Presidential term (as under current law), or until the individual's earlier death, resignation, removal from office, or inability, unless the individual's discharge of the powers and duties of the office is founded in whole or in part on the inability of the President or Vice President, in which case the individual shall act only until the removal of the President's or Vice President's disability. Exempts an acting President from automatic resignation of his or her current office if such person's service as acting President is based in whole or in part on the temporary incapacity of the President or Vice President. Removes acting cabinet officers from the line of presidential succession."
