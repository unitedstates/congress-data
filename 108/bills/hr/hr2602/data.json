    "text": "Scientifically Identifying the Need for Critical Habitat Act - Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to change from mandatory to discretionary the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to designate critical habitat of an endangered or threatened species. Directs the Secretary, when required by the Act to use the best scientific and commercial data available, in evaluating comparable data to give greater weight to such data that is empirical or has been field-tested or peer-reviewed. Specifies requirements for the use of sound science in the listing of endangered or threatened species such as: (1) the establishment of criteria for scientific studies to support the listing; (2) use of data obtained by observation of the species in the field; and (3) use of data from landowners who have observed such species on their land. Requires the use of sound science in the preparation of a recovery plan for an endangered or threatened species. Sets forth requirements for: (1) peer review before certain action can become final with respect to endangered or threatened species; and (2) use of information provided by States affected by such species or their habitat for recovery plans."
