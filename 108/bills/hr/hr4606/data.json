Prohibits the Secretary from obligating any funds appropriated to the Fund in a fiscal year until the Secretary has deposited a matching amount provided by non-Federal interests of at least 35 percent for a project. Makes each authority responsible for providing the required non-Federal amount. Directs the Secretary to credit the appropriate authority with the value of all prior compatible expenditures by non-Federal interests made after January 1, 2000. Authorizes appropriations."
