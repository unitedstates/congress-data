States that title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 shall not apply to tribes: (1) covered by the Indian Civil Rights Act (title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1968); or (2) tribes acting under affordable housing provisions of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996. Amends the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act to make Indian tribes, tribally designated housing entities, or other agencies primarily serving Indians eligible for Youthbuild grants. Amends the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 to require Federal guarantees for tribal housing activities to guarantee repayment of 95 percent of the unpaid principal and interest due on the notes or other obligations."
