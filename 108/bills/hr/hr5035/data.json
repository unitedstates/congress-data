Requires the Secretary, on the date of enactment of this Act, to begin developing a plan, acquiring and training personnel, and acquiring equipment for providing such screening. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to take necessary action to ensure that: (1) no such aircraft flies within 1,500 feet of any structure or building, or over a city with a population of 1 million or more or any other location the Secretary determines appropriate, except on approach or departure to an airport; and (2) the pilot of a flight of any such aircraft remains in contact with the Federal Aviation Administration regardless of that aircraft's altitude. Makes an exception for aircraft carrying out police, medical, or other operations as the Secretary deems appropriate."
