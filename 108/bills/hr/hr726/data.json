Defines such chemical agents as chemical weapons precursors. Allows the Secretary to revoke licenses. Requires the licensee to make available to law enforcement authorities records of the purchase, sale, or distribution of chemical weapons precursors and to report any suspicious purchases of such items. Prescribes civil penalties for violating this Act, and a criminal penalty for intentional violations."
