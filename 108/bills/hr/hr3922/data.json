    "text": "Drug Impaired Driving Enforcement Act of 2004 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to develop and provide to the States a model statute relating to drug impaired driving which incorporates certain mandatory and discretionary provisions, including, at a minimum, a provision that the crime of drug impaired driving is committed when a person operates a motor vehicle: (1) while any detectable amount of a controlled substance is present in the person's body; or (2) due to the presence of a controlled substance or a controlled substance in combination with alcohol or an inhalant, or both, the person's mental or physical faculties are affected to a noticeable degree. Specifies discretionary provisions, including: (1) sanctions for refusing to submit to a drug test which are equivalent to sanctions for a positive test result; (2) a system of evaluation, counseling, treatment, and supervision for persons convicted of drug impaired driving; (3) a graduated system of penalties for repeat offenses; and (4) authorization for States to suspend or revoke the license of a driver convicted of driving while under the influence of a controlled substance. Amends Federal highway law to make grants available to States that adopt and implement effective programs to reduce traffic safety problems resulting from individuals driving while under the influence of a controlled substance. Makes basic grants available to States that provide for at least one of five enumerated programs aimed at enforcing laws against drug impaired driving. Authorizes the Secretary to use certain funds for research and development in drug detection and testing technology. Specifies certain training goals to enhance the State's ability to detect, enforce, and prosecute drug impaired driving laws."
