Requires the Secretary of the military department concerned to inform the former prisoner that historical information about the prison camp and other appropriate circumstances may be considered by the Secretary in evaluating an application for award of the Purple Heart and that the former prisoner may submit such information. Directs such Secretary to take into account the length of time that the award applicant was held in captivity to help determine whether the former prisoner was likely to have been wounded, starved, or denied medical treatment."
