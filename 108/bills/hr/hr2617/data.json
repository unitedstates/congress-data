    "text": "Consumer Identity and Information Security Act of 2003 - Prohibits the following actions regarding an individual's social security number: (1) displaying it; (2) displaying it on any means of access required for products or services provided to an individual; (3) requiring an individual to transmit his social security number over the Internet unless the connection is secure or the number is encrypted; (4) requiring an individual to use his social security number to access an Internet Web site unless an authentication device is also required to access such site; and (5) displaying an individual's social security number on communications to the individual unless required by law. Prohibits denial or discrimination in the provision of products or services solely because an individual requests non-display of his social security number. Prohibits printing on any receipt provided to a cardholder or accountholder at the point of the business transaction for the purpose of initiating electronic fund transfers: (1) more than the last five digits of the account number of a credit card, debit card, or consumer account; or (2) the expiration date of such credit card, debit card, or other means of access to a consumer account. Amends the Truth in Lending Act to mandate procedures for verification of consumer identity upon receiving a request for: (1) an additional card after a change of address; or (2) after a change of address. Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to mandate that a consumer reporting agency: (1) include and disseminate a fraud alert initiated by a consumer; and (2) maintain a toll-free telephone number for such consumer requests. Requires the Federal Trade Commission to establish procedures to: (1) log and acknowledge receipt of complaints that database information has likely been stolen or compromised; (2) provide informational guidelines for a business to follow when customer or other information in its database has likely been stolen or compromised; (3) provide guilelines for a business to follow in notifying customers of such a situation; and (4) refer complaints to each consumer reporting agency that compiles files on customers on a nationwide basis, and to appropriate law enforcement agencies."
