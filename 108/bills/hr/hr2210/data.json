    "text": "School Readiness Act of 2003 - Amends the Head Start Act (the Act) to revise and reauthorize Head Start programs. Title I: Head Start Reauthorization and Program Improvements - (Sec. 103) Extends through FY 2008 the authorization of appropriations for Head Start programs, with specified amounts for impact studies, other research, demonstration, and evaluation activities, and administrative expenses. (Sec. 104) Revises requirements for allotment of and limitations on use of Head Start funds. Sets at one percent of appropriations the amount the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) is required to reserve for training and technical assistance activities, and distribute in the following portions: (1) at least 50 percent to local Head Start agencies for certain uses and for complying with specified quality standards; (2) at least 30 percent to support a State system of early childhood education training and technical assistance; and (3) at least 20 percent for the Secretary to assist local programs in meeting certain quality standards. Reserves another one percent to be used by the Secretary to fund other activities, with the following portions to be made available: (1) at least 25 percent for expansion of services by Migrant and Seasonal Head Start programs (or, if numbers of migrant and seasonal eligible children are insufficient, for other disadvantaged populations,); and (2) at least 60 percent for specified quality improvement activities. Requires that a portion of any remaining funds (after specified reservations) be made available to expand services to underserved children such as those under the Early Head Start and Migrant and Seasonal Head Start programs. Revises activities for which quality improvement funds are to be used to include outreach to homeless families, migrant and seasonal farmworker families, and families with children with a limited English proficiency.

Requires the participating State to continue to give funds to any current local grantee for 60 months after the effective date of the demonstration program (which itself is in effect for five Federal fiscal years), if the local grantee: (1) has no uncorrected deficiencies identified in monitoring reports from the most recent five-year period; and (2) is determined, by the State, to be in compliance with the State's plan for the demonstration program.
