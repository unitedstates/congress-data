Extends the meaning of qualifying State to include waivers first implemented, and 185 percent-of-the-poverty-line eligibility standards operating, on several specified dates to allow additional States (New Mexico, Maryland, Hawaii, and Rhode Island) to use such portion of their unspent SCHIP funds for covering such children under Medicaid."
