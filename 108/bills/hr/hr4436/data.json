Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to develop a plan to end section 8 waiting lists. States that if the Secretary withdraws amounts from the reserve account for any public housing agency, or takes any other action that reduces reserve accounts without agency approval, the Secretary shall: (1) notify the agency of such withdrawal or action; and (2) before the commencement of the quarter of the fiscal year first commencing after such withdrawal or action, replenish the reserve account with the full amount of such withdrawal or reduction. Prohibits a zero balance withdrawal by the Secretary without prior notice to, and written approval from, a public housing agency. Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 to authorize additional appropriations for the fair housing initiatives program."
