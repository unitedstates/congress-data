Establishes an Assistant Secretary of Manufacturing and a Manufacturing Advisory Board. Repeals the program to monitor Japanese technical activities and developments and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Technology. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of Commerce for: (1) Manufacturing Engineering activities at the Scientific and Technical Research and Services Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) ; (2) the Advanced Technology Program; and (3) the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program. Amends the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act to require the Director of NIST to establish a program of assistance to institutions of higher education or nonprofit research institutions that enter into partnerships with for-profit entities to support, promote, and enhance manufacturing research and development. Requires the Director to establish a program to award postdoctoral research and senior research fellowships to individuals seeking research positions at institutions, including the Institute, engaged in research activities related to manufacturing sciences. Revises requirements of the Advanced Technology Program to permit institutions of higher education or nonprofit oprganizations to lead joint ventures, as well as take title to intellectual property developed by them. Directs the Under Secretary of Commerce for Manufacturing and Technology to develop a plan to maximize the utilization of Federal programs such as the Small Business Innovation Research Program and the Small Business Technology Transfer Program to support manufacturing sciences. Authorizes appropriations to the Director of the National Science Foundation for: (1) the Advanced Technological Education Program under the Scientific and Advanced-Technology Act of 1992; and (2) the Manufacturing Skill Standards Council formed as the voluntary partnership for the manufacturing occupational cluster under the National Skill Standards Act of 1994."
