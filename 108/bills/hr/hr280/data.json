Declares that the boundaries designated for the Area represent the area within which Federal funds appropriated for this title may be expended and that the establishment of the Area and its boundaries shall not be construed to provide any nonexisting regulatory authority on land use within the Area or its viewshed by the Secretary, the National Park Service, or AHFI. (Sec. 111) Authorizes appropriations. Limits: (1) the total amount of funding to carry out this title and the total for any fiscal year; and (2) the Federal share of the cost of activities carried out using any assistance or grant under this title to 50 percent.

Allows the Secretary, until such time as the Secretary has acquired the properties, to enter into a cooperative agreement with any interested individual, public or private agency, organization, or institution to further the purposes of the Site. Provides that, any payment made by the Secretary pursuant to a cooperative agreement shall be subject to an agreement that conversion, use, or disposal of the project so assisted for purposes contrary to the purpose of the Site shall result in a right of the United States to reimbursement of all funds made available to such a project or the proportion of the increased value of the project attributable to such funds at the time of such conversion, use, or disposal, whichever is greater. Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance for the: (1) preservation of historic structures within the Site; and (2) maintenance of the natural and cultural landscape of such Site.

Provides that nothing in this title: (1) modifies, enlarges, or diminishes any existing authority of the Federal Government or a State or local government to regulate any use of land as provided for by law (including regulations); or (2) grants zoning or land use powers to the Alliance.
