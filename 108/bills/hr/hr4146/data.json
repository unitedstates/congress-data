Requires that the program: (1) include research aimed at understanding and predicting the natural processes that lead to the formation of tornadoes; (2) identify an array of factors that indicate tornado formation; (3) promote the incorporation of the results of such research into the methods used by meteorologists to predict the time and location of tornado formation; (4) provide resources and promote attention to tornado research areas with the greatest potential for improving the understanding of their formation; (5) maximize the effectiveness of the program by encouraging collaborative efforts by operational and research communities in academia and the Government; and (6) provide for the awarding of competitive research grants to, and the entering into of cooperative agreements with, institutions of higher education and other research institutions to conduct peer-reviewed research that may improve the forecast and identification of tornadoes."
