    "text": "Alien Accountability Act - Provides that aliens unlawfully present in the United States who register with the Secretary of Homeland Security shall be permitted to apply for adjustment of status or to voluntarily depart. Grants immunity to employers who jointly register with an unlawfully employed alien or notify the Secretary of the alien's refusal to jointly register, if the employer pays all Federal taxes owed by reason of the unlawful employment. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to create a new W nonimmigrant visa category and allows registering aliens to adjust status pursuant to that category if the alien: (1) applies for adjustment during a six-month period to be specified by the Secretary; (2) pays a fee; (3) abandons other applications for relief; (4) establishes an adequate means of financial support through employment documentation or proof of sponsorship; (5) meets continuous presence requirements (or habitual presence requirements for habitual border crossers from contiguous territories); (6) has not been determined to be inadmissible on specified criminal or national security grounds; and (7) provides truthful answers to all questions posed by the Department of Homeland Security. Establishes an initial period of authorized admission of one year for W nonimmigrants, with the possibility of up to five renewals in one-year increments. Requires the W nonimmigrant visa category to sunset six years after the first alien is granted W nonimmigrant status. Authorizes appropriations to fund an increase in the total number of Government personnel engaged in interior enforcement and alien removal."
