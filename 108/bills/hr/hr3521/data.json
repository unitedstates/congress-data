Treats as a U.S. vessel, in addition to those with fishery endorsements on their certificates of documentation, any vessel without a fishery endorsement which is documented under U.S. laws and licensed under the South Pacific Tuna Act of 1988.

(Sec. 3702) Declares that a reconfigured entry, filed under an IAS statement, which is not liquidated within one year from the date such statement is filed or should have been filed, whichever is earlier, shall be deemed liquidated at the rate of duty, value, quantity, and amount of duties asserted at the time of entry by the importer of record. (Sec. 3703) Revises requirements for protests of final decisions of the Customs Service.
