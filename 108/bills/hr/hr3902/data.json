    "text": "Musconetcong Wild and Scenic Rivers Act - Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate specified segments of the Musconetcong River, New Jersey, as scenic and recreational rivers. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to manage those segments: (1) in accordance with the Musconetcong River Management Plan (dated April 2002), which establishes goals and actions to ensure long-term protection of the outstanding values of the river segments and compatible management of land and water resources associated with such segments; and (2) in cooperation with appropriate Federal, State, regional, and local agencies. Considers the management plan as satisfying the requirements for a comprehensive management plan for those river segments. Directs the Secretary, in determining whether a proposed water resources project would have a direct and adverse effect on the values for which a river segment is designated as part of the Wild and Scenic Rivers System, to consider the extent to which the project is consistent with the management plan. Authorizes the Secretary to provide planning, financial, and technical assistance to local municipalities and nonprofit organizations to assist in the implementation of actions to protect the natural and historic resources of the river segments. Provides for the designation of additional river segments if there is adequate local support."
