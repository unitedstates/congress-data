(Sec. 6) Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should seek a multilateral strategy, particularly with the countries of Europe, to further the purposes of this Act. (Sec. 7) Directs the President to report with respect to: (1) weapons-related activities by Belarus; and (2) the personal wealth of Aleksander Lukashenka and other senior leadership. (Sec. 8) Declares congressional policy: (1) respecting the persecution and disappearance of journalists and political opponents in Belarus; and (2) commending the democratic opposition in Belarus.
