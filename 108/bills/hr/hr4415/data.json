Imposes an annual numerical limitation of 35,000 on the number of L visas that may be issued to principal aliens. Removes L nonimmigrants from those classes of aliens that are not presumed to be immigrants (and thus requires L nonimmigrants to establish their entitlement to nonimmigrant status at the time of applying for a visa or admission). Expresses the sense of Congress that employers should pay L nonimmigrants the greater of the actual wage level paid to similarly qualified individuals for the specific employment in question or the prevailing wage level for the occupational classification in the area of employment."
