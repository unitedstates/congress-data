Requires the use of such funding for: (1) eligible owners or operators to support efforts to reduce system costs, and improve the performance and reliability of advanced distributed power generation and energy storage systems; and (2) demonstrating the capability of new technologies to increase power generation through enhanced operational, economic, and environmental performance. Directs the Secretary to: (1) evaluate security and assurance performance improvement; (2) define locations and facilities that would benefit most from such improvements; and (3) determine the criteria for facilities that generate or store and distribute electric energy that improves the security and reliability of the nation's electricity grid and protects locations critical to its security (including military installations, financial institutions, medical and first responder facilities)."
