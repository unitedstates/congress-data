Authorizes the Administrator of EPA to: (1) award cooperative agreements to federally-recognized Indian tribes to assist in implementing Federal environmental programs; (2) collect and obligate pesticide registration service fees; and (3) use FY 2005 appropriations to award brownfield remediation grants under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980.
