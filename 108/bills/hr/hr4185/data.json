    "text": "International Security Enhancement Act of 2004 - Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to direct the Secretary to establish within the Department of State an Office of Overseas Contingencies and Stabilization, which shall: (1) be headed by the Undersecretary for Overseas Contingencies and Stabilization; and (2) have primary responsibility for planning and administering non-military aspects of overseas contingency operations, including pre-conflict stabilization operations and post-conflict reconstruction operations, in countries of impending or immediate risk. Organizes the Office into: (1) the Bureau of Contingency Planning; (2) the Bureau of Contingency Training, which shall contain an International Contingency Training Center, and a Civilian Overseas Contingency Force; and (3) the Bureau of Contingency Coordination. Directs the Undersecretary to identify weak or failing countries and categorize such countries according to risk levels (country of risk, country of impending risk, and country of immediate risk). Sets forth: (1) identification and categorization criteria; and (2) planning and monitoring requirements for countries so categorized. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to establish in the Treasury the Department of State Emergency Stabilization Operations Support Fund. Authorizes the President to provide Fund amounts to the Office for a country of impending or immediate risk. Amends Federal law to provide that whenever the commander of a regional combatant command begins planning for a contingency operation, the commander shall establish within the combatant command a joint interagency task force to prepare for any post-conflict reconstruction operations that may result from such operation. Establishes in the Executive Office of the President the Joint Task Force for Stabilization, Reconstruction, and Contingency Operations Coordination, which shall ensure Federal coordination before, during, and after instances in which the United States participates in foreign pre-conflict stabilization operations, contingency operations, and post-conflict reconstruction operations. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) funds appropriated to carry out the amendments made by this Act should be offset by reductions in redundant or duplicative functions and foreign assistance programs of the Department of State; and (2) increased staff levels required by the amendments made by this Act should be offset by the transfer of staff within the Department of State, and the elimination of resultant redundant Department of State functions."
