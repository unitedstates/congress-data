Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 to authorize the Secretary of Energy to: (1) prepare a comprehensive interagency coordination plan for research, development, and demonstration programs and activities designated under such Act; and (2) conduct a program to transfer technology to the private sector in order to foster the exchange of generic, nonproprietary information and technology developed under this Act among industry, academia, and the Federal Government. Declares that the goals of the research and development program are to enable: (1) a decision by automakers by 2015 to offer affordable and technically viable hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in the mass consumer market; and (2) production and delivery to consumers of model year 2020 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles meeting specified requirements. Instructs the Secretary to conduct a research and development and demonstration programs for: (1) hydrogen infrastructure; (2) fuel cells and fuel cell technologies including hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles; and (3) hydrogen codes, standards, and safety protocols. Prescribes implementation guidelines. Directs the President to establish an interagency task force to: (1) address development of designated hydrogen infrastructure, fuel cells in government applications, and vehicle hydrogen fuel system integrity safety; and (2) coordinate interagency programs and activities, including information exchange. Replaces the Hydrogen Technnical Advisory Panel with the Hydrogen Technical and Fuel Cell Advisory Committee to advise the Secretary on the programs and activities under such Act. Repeals the Hydrogen Future Act of 1996."
