Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to States in support of State pharmacy benefit assistance programs. Requires a percentage of profits from the sale of certain drugs and biological products to be placed in a revolving fund and used to support the grants program. Limits the tax deductions for advertising for prescription drug manufacturers. Limits the extension of the 30-month stay of FDA approval for any new (generic) drug, as specified, thereby limiting the brand name drug's patent owner's period of exclusive sales. Makes a patent owner's failure to timely file a civil action for infringement a bar to later action.Sets forth requirements for filing drug patent information with the FDA. Makes a patent owner's failure to timely file with the FDA a bar to civil actions for patent infringement. Requires the first generic drug applicant with a specified certification to forfeit the 180-day marketing exclusivity period to a subsequent generic drug applicant if the first generic drug applicant engages in certain behaviors which delay or prevent the marketing of the generic drug."
