Specifies the type of screening and the frequency of screening required. Allows State laws providing greater protection than that provided by this Act. Applies the same requirements to health insurance coverage offered in the individual market. Requires the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to coordinate their rules, regulations and enforcement policies."
