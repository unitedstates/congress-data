    "text": "Amend Federal retirement provisions relating to the Civil Service Retirement System and the Federal Employees' Retirement System to raise, from 60 to 65, the mandatory separation age for employees of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) who have been exempted, because it is in the public interest to do so, by the head of the agency from being retired at the earlier automatic separation age limit of 57. Sets forth provisions for payment of retention and relocation bonuses for the FBI. Authorizes the Director of the FBI to provide for the establishment and training of a Federal Bureau of Investigation Reserve Service (FBI Reserve Service) for temporary reemployment in the FBI of previously full-time employees of the FBI during emergencies. Limits the membership of the FBI Reserve Service to 500 members at any given time. Amends Federal law relating to Government organization and employees, to include, with regard to pay authority for critical positions, positions at the FBI, the primary duties and responsibilities of which relate to intelligence functions."
