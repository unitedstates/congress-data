Directs the Tribes to convey title to the Dawson Ranch to the United States. Declares that: (1) all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the Ranch, including all improvements and appurtenances to the Ranch and rights to all minerals, are to be held in trust by the United States for the Tribes; and (2) the Ranch is to become part of the Tribes' Indian reservation. Requires the Ranch to be administered by the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with the law generally applicable to property held in trust for Indian tribes and the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site Establishment Act of 2000. Instructs that the Ranch be used only for historic, religious, or cultural uses that are compatible with the use of the land as a national historic site."
