Requires such standards to be: (1) sufficiently flexible to allow local government officials to set priorities based on their needs, while reaching nationally-determined preparedness levels within a fixed time period; and (2) measurable and subject to Federal audit. Directs the Secretary to: (1) determine minimum essential emergency preparedness and response capabilities for each State; (2) measure the progress of each State in achieving such capabilities and in complying with standards issued by the Secretary; and (3) include in the FY 2005 budget request for the Department of Homeland Security a separate minimum essential emergency preparedness and response capability standard for metropolitan areas and for rural areas with respect to weapons of mass destruction and terrorism-related disaster equipment and training."
