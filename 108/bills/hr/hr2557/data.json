(Sec. 2002) Amends the WRDA of: (1) 1986 to prohibit the Secretary from soliciting from non-Federal interests the costs of projects or measures in excess of the assigned non-Federal share; (2) 1986 to increase from 45 to 53 feet the depth of harbor projects for which non-Federal interests must pay the maximum share of construction and operations costs; and (3) 2000 to extend through FY 2005 the Secretary's authority to accept and expend non-Federal funds to expedite the evaluation of permits.
