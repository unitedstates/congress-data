    "text": "Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 - (Sec. 3) Amends the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA) to direct the President to establish programs of border interdiction outside the United States by providing grants to foreign nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that provide for transit shelters operating at key border crossings, and help train survivors of trafficking in persons to educate and train border guards, officials, and other law enforcement officials to: (1) identify traffickers and victims of severe forms of trafficking; (2) treat such victims appropriately; and (3) monitor the implementation of border interdiction programs, including helping in the identification of such victims to stop the cross-border transit of victims. Requires the President to establish programs supporting the production of television and radio programs to: (1) inform vulnerable populations overseas of the dangers of trafficking; and (2) increase awareness of the public in countries of destination regarding the slave-like practices and other human rights abuses involved in trafficking. Directs the President to: (1) ensure that materials are developed and disseminated to alert travelers that sex tourism is illegal, will be prosecuted, and presents dangers to those involved, (2) monitor compliance with these requirements; and (3) report to specified congressional committees on the feasibility of such U.S. Government materials being disseminated through public-private partnerships to individuals traveling to foreign destinations. Directs the President to ensure that any Federal grant, contract, or cooperative agreement under which certain assistance funds relating to international affairs are to be provided to a private entity, in whole or in part, shall include a condition that authorizes the Federal department or agency involved to terminate the grant, contract, or agreement, without penalty, if the grantee or any subgrantee, or the contractor or any subcontractor: (1) engages in specified severe forms of trafficking in persons or has procured a commercial sex act during the period of time that the grant, contract, or cooperative agreement is in effect; or (2) uses forced labor in the performance of the grant, contract, or agreement. (Sec. 4) Requires certain State Department programs in foreign countries to facilitate contact and cooperation between relevant foreign government agencies and NGOs providing services to trafficked individuals, particularly those in detention. Extends to nonimmigrant alien family members the same benefits and services available to a trafficking victim. Allows such benefits and services, in the case of nonentitlement programs funded by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to include services to assist potential victims of trafficking in achieving certification and to assist minor dependent children of victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons or potential victims of trafficking. Revises the benefits and services eligibility criteria for trafficking victims to consider a victim's willingness to assist with a State or local investigation as well as with a Federal investigation. (Current law limits the criterion to assistance with a Federal investigation.) Allows a victim of criminal trafficking offenses to bring a civil action in any appropriate U.S. district court for actual damages, punitive damages, reasonable attorneys' fees, and other litigation costs reasonably incurred. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to increase from 15 to 18 the minimum age at which a trafficking victim is required to assist in investigations and prosecutions to be eligible for a \"T\" visa. Adds unmarried siblings under age 18 to the family members of a trafficking victim eligible for a \"T\" visa. Declares that, with respect to determining eligibility for a nonimmigrant \"T\" visa for trafficking victims, statements shall be considered from State and local law enforcement officials that the alien has complied with any reasonable request for assistance in the investigation or prosecution of crimes such as kidnapping, rape, slavery, or other forced labor offenses, where severe forms of trafficking in persons appear to have been involved. Makes the public charge ground for inadmissibility under a \"T\" visa inapplicable to trafficking victims.
