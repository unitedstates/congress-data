(Sec. 3) Authorizes a State to transfer unobligated apportionments, with transferred funds subject to the provisions of the program to which the funds are transferred. Directs the Secretary, as soon as practicable after the enactment of a law reauthorizing the Federal-aid highway program enacted after this Act's enactment, to restore any funds that a State transferred for any project not eligible for the funds but for this section to the program category from which the funds were transferred. Authorizes the Secretary to establish procedures under which funds transferred from a program category for which funds are not authorized may be restored to the Federal-aid highway program. (Sec. 4) Makes specified funds available from the Highway Trust Fund for administrative expenses of the Federal-aid highway program for FY 2004, subject to a limitation on obligations for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs.
