Makes designations effective until revoked or set aside (currently effective for two years, subject to revocation). Sets forth procedures requiring the Secretary to review the designation of a foreign terrorist organization upon the organization's filing a petition for revocation within two years after such designation. Requires the Secretary to review a designation if no review has taken place within a four-year period. Authorizes the Secretary to amend a designation. Amends the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 to require the inclusion in the State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism of: (1) information concerning specified terrorist groups that are known to have obtained or developed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) or that are designated as foreign terrorist organizations under the INA; and (2) to the extent feasible, information concerning countries that have assisted terrorists in obtaining or developing WMDs."
