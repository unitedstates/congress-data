Amends Federal copyright law to extend for five years the existing grandfather clause permitting otherwise ineligible subscribers (grandfathered subscribers) to receive secondary transmissions of the signal of a network station outside of the subscribers local market (distant signal) if such subscribers do not receive a signal of a certain strength from the local network station affiliated with the same network. (Sec. 102) Extends such statutory license to the secondary transmission by a satellite carrier in a State in which there is a single full-power network station, of the primary transmission of that station to any subscriber in a community within the State, but not within the first 50 major television markets as listed by FCC regulations. Applies such statutory license to the secondary transmission by a satellite carrier in a State in which all network stations and superstations are assigned to one local market, of the primary transmission of any station located in the State capital to any subscriber located in a community within that State and within the first 50 major television markets. Extends such statutory license to the secondary transmission by a satellite carrier of a primary transmission of any network station in a State to any subscriber if: (1) the subscriber is located in one of four counties in local markets principally comprised of counties in another State as of January 1, 2004; (2) such counties had a combined total of 41,340 households, according to U.S. Television Household Estimates by Nielsen Media Research for 2004; and (3) the satellite carrier was making such secondary transmission on January 1, 2004.

Applies such statutory license to the retransmission by a satellite carrier of the distant analog signal to a subscriber in an unserved household if, as of January 1, 2005: (1) a local analog signal affiliated with the same network is available, and the satellite carrier submits a list to the television network by March 1, 2005, that identifies the subscriber and specifies the distant analog signals received by the subscriber; or (2) a local analog signal is not available at the time the subscriber requests retransmission of the distant analog signal and the satellite carrier submits a list to each television network within 60 days of offering such a local analog signal that identifies each subscriber in the local market and specifies the distant analog signals received by the subscriber. Provides that such statutory license does not apply to retransmissions of the distant signal to a subscriber who is not lawfully receiving distant signals on the date of enactment of this Act and who is in a community in which the satellite carrier makes available the local signal affiliated with the same network before the subscriber seeks to receive such distant signals and such local signals can reach the subscriber. Extends such statutory license to the secondary transmission of the primary digital transmission of a network station by a satellite carrier to a subscriber if such transmission is permitted by this Act. Allows a subscriber who has been denied a distant signal due to the availability of a local signal affiliated with the same network to request a waiver from a network station. Provides that a waiver granted before enactment of this Act under the unserved household provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 does not constitute such a waiver. Provides that a local signal shall be considered to be made available to a subscriber if the satellite carrier offers that local signal to any subscriber within the same zip code. Allows a subscriber who has been denied the distant signal of a network station under the unserved household provisions to request a waiver from the network station that is asserting that the secondary transmission is prohibited. Deems the station to have agreed with such waiver request if it fails to act within 30 days. Provides that a waiver granted before enactment of this Act under the unserved household provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 does constitute such a waiver. Requires the royalty fee due from a satellite carrier for retransmissions of a network station to be computed by multiplying the total number of subscribers receiving each retransmission of each superstation or network station during each calendar month by the appropriate rate in effect under this Act. Provides that a satellite carrier shall have no royalty obligation for secondary transmissions of the distant signal of a significantly viewed station to a subscriber under this Act. Requires the Librarian of Congress to publish in the Federal Register on or before January 2, 2005, notice of the initiation of voluntary negotiation proceedings to determine a reasonable royalty fee to be paid by satellite carriers for retransmissions of network stations or superstations. Allows parties who have reached a voluntary agreement on royalty fees to request that such fees be applied to all satellite carriers, distributors, and copyright owners without arbitration. Requires the Librarian of Congress to: (1) adopt such royalty fees unless a party with an intent to participate in arbitration proceedings and a significant interest in the outcome objects; or (2) publish on or before May 1, 2005, notice of the initiation of arbitration proceedings to determine a reasonable royalty fee for retransmissions by satellite carriers and distributors. Requires the copyright arbitration royalty panel, absent a voluntary agreement applicable to all satellite carriers, distributors and copyright owners, to establish royalty fees that most clearly represent the fair market value of such transmissions, except that the Librarian of Congress and the panel must adjust those fees to account for the obligations of the parties under any voluntary agreement filed with the Copyright Office. Provides that the process and requirement for establishing a royalty fee for digital signals is the same as that for establishing a fee for analog signals, except that for digital signals: (1) the fees are reduced by 22.5 percent; (2) the notice of arbitration proceeding must be published on or before December 31, 2005; and (3) such fees must be adjusted by the Librarian of Congress on January 1, 2007, and annually thereafter, to reflect any changes in the Consumer Price Index. (Sec. 104) Extends such statutory license to retransmissions by a satellite carrier of the signals of a low power television station to a subscriber who resides within the same local market. Sets forth geographic limitations for such secondary transmissions. Excludes from such statutory licensing retransmissions from low power television stations that retransmit the programs and signals of another television station for more than two hours each day. Prescribes when royalty fees are due for such secondary transmissions of low power television stations. Limits such secondary transmissions of low power television stations to only those subscribers also receiving retransmissions of local signals. (Sec. 106) Provides that nothing in this Act shall modify any remedy imposed on a party by a judgment of a court in any action brought before May 1, 2004, for a violation of law regarding statutory licensing for retransmissions of superstations and network stations. (Sec. 107) Extends such statutory license to the secondary transmissions by a satellite carrier of a superstation for viewing in a commercial establishment, including bars, restaurants, fitness clubs or any other establishment with a common business area. (Sec. 108) Requires the Department of Justice to respond within 90 days to a request by two or more satellite carriers for a business review letter to assess the legality under antitrust laws of proposed business conduct to make or carry out an agreement to provide retransmissions of local signals to subscribers in a market in which there is currently no satellite carrier offering such retransmissions. (Sec. 109) Requires the Register of Copyright to submit a report to the relevant congressional committees by June 30, 2008, on the operation and revision of the statutory licenses for secondary transmissions of distant and local signals, including: (1) a comparison of the royalties paid by licensees; (2) an analysis of the differences in the terms and conditions of the various licenses, whether these differences are justified by historical, technological, or regulatory differences that affect the satellite and cable industries, and whether either the cable or satellite industry is placed in a competitive disadvantage due to these terms and conditions; (3) an analysis of whether the licenses are still justified by the bases upon which they were originally created; (4) an analysis of whether savings on royalties and fees are passed on to cable and satellite subscribers; and (5) an analysis of the issues that may arise with respect to the applicability of the licenses to digital signals. (Sec. 110) Requires the Register of Copyrights to report to the relevant congressional committees by December 31, 2005, on the extent to which: (1) the unserved household limitations for network stations have efficiently and effectively protected copyright owners of over-the-air television programming; and (2) retransmissions of network stations and superstations harm copyright owners of broadcast programming throughout the United States and the effect of the statutory license provided to retransmission of local signals in reducing such harm. (Sec. 111) Provides that the statutory license otherwise provided for in this Act does not apply to secondary transmissions of distant signals outside of Alaska to any subscriber in that State to whom the local signal affiliated with the same network is made available by the satellite carrier, except that a subscriber may receive digital signals if no stations licensed to a community in the State and affiliated with the same network make primary transmissions of a digital signal. Deems any area in Alaska that is outside of a designated market area to be part of one of the local markets. Allows a satellite carrier to determine in which local market to place each subscriber in such an area. Title II: Federal Communications Commission Operations - (Sec. 201) Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to extend until December 31, 2009, the exemption that allows a cable system or multichannel video programing distributor to retransmit signals of network stations directly to a home satellite antenna without the express authority of the originating station if the subscriber receiving the signal is outside the local market of such stations and resides in an unserved household. (Sec. 202) Allows a satellite carrier to retransmit to subscribers located in a community, in addition to the local and distant broadcast signals that subscribers may otherwise receive, distant signals of a station determined by the FCC to be significantly viewed in that community. Limits retransmissions of the analog signal of a significantly viewed television broadcast station to those subscribers who also receive retransmissions of local analog signals. Limits retransmissions of the digital signal of a significantly viewed network station to subscribers who also receive retransmissions of local digital signals, but only if: (1) the retransmission of the local network station occupies at least the equivalent bandwidth as the distant digital signal; or (2) the retransmission of the local network station carries the entire bandwidth of the local digital signal. Provides that these limitations do not apply to a subscriber in a local market in which there are no local stations affiliated with the same television network as the significantly viewed station whose signal is being transmitted. Allows a satellite carrier to retransmit a significantly viewed network station if and to the extent that the local affiliate of the same network has waived the requirements that a subscriber must also be receiving the local signal. Requires the FCC to: (1) publish a list of stations and communities eligible for retransmissions under the significantly viewed provisions of this Act; (2) adopt rules to implement such provisions; (3) publish and update such list on the FCC website; and (4) permit a satellite carrier to petition for decisions and orders by which stations and communities may be added to those that are eligible for retransmissions of the signals of significantly viewed stations and by which network nonduplication or syndicated exclusivity regulations are applied to such retransmissions. Provides that carriage of a signal of a significantly viewed station is not mandatory and has no affect on the right of a station to be carried into the local market. Provides that FCC rules concerning network nonduplication and syndicated exclusivity do not apply to significantly viewed signals under this Act unless the FCC determines otherwise. Prohibits the application of network nonduplication or syndicated exclusivity regulations to the retransmission of distant signals of network stations to unserved households. Sets forth provisions regarding violations of this Act by satellite carriers, including enforcement through cease-and-desist orders and damage awards. Directs a satellite carrier to provide written notice to the affiliated local station 60 days in advance of commencing retransmission of a significantly viewed station and to designate on the carrier's website all significantly viewed stations retransmitted and the communities receiving such signals. Requires the FCC to allow a television broadcast station that is being retransmitted into the local market by a satellite carrier, which is also planning to retransmit or is transmitting the signals of a significantly viewed station affiliated with the same network, to elect between retransmission consent and mandatory carriage for each county within such station's local market. Directs: (1) the FCC to require any such station to conduct a unified negotiation for the entire portion of its local market for which retransmission pursuant to consent is elected; and (2) the satellite carrier to provide notice to the station of which significantly viewed signals it reserves the right to retransmit during the next year. (Sec. 203) Requires a satellite carrier to transmit all local analog signals retransmitted by that carrier within a local market by means of a single reception antenna and associated equipment within 18 months of enactment of this Act. Allows the satellite carrier to transmit digital signals by means of a separate antenna, but requires all local digital signals to be transmitted by means of a single reception antenna. Requires such satellite carrier to provide notice to subscribers and licensees for local stations of: (1) any reallocation of signals between different antennas that the carrier intends to make; (2) the need for subscribers to obtain an additional antenna; and (3) any cessation of carriage or other material change in the carriage of signals as a consequence of these requirements. Provides that: (1) a low power television station is not entitled to mandatory carriage under the Communications Act of 1934, regardless of whether the satellite carrier transmits the signal of other local stations; and (2) such low power stations will not be considered in the application of nonduplication provisions. (Sec. 204) Allows a grandfathered subscriber to receive secondary transmissions of the distant analog signal of a network station where a local analog signal affiliated with the same network is available if such subscriber elects to retain the distant analog signal within 60 days of receiving notice of the availability of the local analog signal, but only until such time as the subscriber elects to receive the local signal. Requires the satellite carrier to submit to the television network the required list and statement. Prohibits a satellite carrier from retransmitting a distant analog signal of a network station to a grandfathered subscriber who was not receiving such a signal from a station affiliated with the same network as of October 1, 2004. Allows a subscriber in an unserved household where a local analog signal is available by January 1, 2005, to receive a distant analog signal from a station affiliated with the same network if the satellite carrier submits to the television network the required list and statement. Allows a subscriber in an unserved household where a local analog signal is not available by January 1, 2005, to receive a distant analog signal affiliated with the same network if the subscriber seeks to subscribe to such distant signal before the carrier offers the local analog signal and the carrier submits the required list and statement. Prohibits a satellite carrier from providing a distant analog signal to a subscriber: (1) not lawfully receiving the distant analog signal as of the date of enactment of this Act; (2) residing in a community where the local analog signal of the affiliated station is available by the time the person seeks to receive the distant analog signal; and (3) the local analog signal can reach such subscriber. Provides that a subscriber is eligible to receive a distant digital signal of a station affiliated with a local station if the subscriber: (1) is located in an area outside the predicted coverage area of the analog signal of the affiliated local station; (2) is in an unserved household; (3) is otherwise determined to be unable to receive a digital signal of the local station that exceeds the signal intensity standard. Allows a lawful subscriber of a distant digital signal as of the date of enactment of this Act to continue to receive such signal, whether or not the subscriber elects to receive the local digital signal affiliated with the same network. Allows a satellite carrier to transmit a distant digital signal to subscribers after the satellite carrier has made the local digital signal affiliated with the same network available, if: (1) the distant digital signal is the secondary transmission of a station whose prime time network programming is generally broadcast simultaneously with, or later than, the local affiliate of the same network; (2) the retransmission of the distant digital signal occupies at least the equivalent bandwidth as the digital signal broadcast; and (3) the subscriber subscribes to the analog signal of the local station within 60 days after such signal is made available by the satellite carrier and adds to or replaces such local analog signal within 60 days after the local digital signal is made available, except that the distant digital signal may continue to be provided to a subscriber who cannot be reached by the satellite transmission of the local digital signal. Prohibits a satellite carrier from offering the distant digital signal of a station to a new subscriber to the distant digital service once the carrier makes available the local digital signal affiliated with the same network unless such subscriber cannot be reached by the satellite transmission of the local digital signal. Allows a satellite carrier to offer the distant digital signal of a network station to subscribers if such carrier does not make available the local digital signal of the affiliated station and the distant digital signal is the secondary transmission of a station whose prime time network programming is generally broadcast simultaneously with, or later than, the local affiliate of the same network, except such subscriber may continue to receive the distant digital signal if such subscriber also receives the local digital signal. Exempts subscribers that cannot be reached by the satellite transmission of the local digital signal from that requirement. Provides that a subscriber is eligible to receive a distant digital signal if such subscriber is determined not to be able to receive a signal that exceeds the specified signal intensity standard from the local station affiliated with the same network. Details requirements for: (1) testing for receipt of digital service; and (2) the allocation of cost. Sets forth time frames when such subscribers will be eligible to receive distant digital signals based on the local network station affiliated with the same network, including when such local station is a translator station. Allows the FCC to grant a waiver to delay digital strength testing and to prohibit subscribers from receiving such testing with respect to a station based on clear and convincing evidence that the station's digital signal coverage is limited due to the unremediable presence of specified problems. Allows the FCC to grant a waiver to a translator station if such station is not broadcasting a digital signal due to the frequent occurrence of bad weather or mountainous terrain at the transmitter tower station. Allows a satellite carrier to provide a distant digital or analog signal of a television station if the local station affiliated with the same network has granted a waiver to the satellite carrier with respect to the retransmission of such distant signal to the subscriber. Requires a satellite carrier that provides a distant digital signal to grandfathered subscribers or unserved households to submit to each network within 60 days the following required list and statement: (1) a list, aggregated by designated market area, identifying each subscriber provided such a signal; and (2) a statement that the subscriber is qualified to receive the distant network signal. Requires a satellite carrier who is transmitting a distant signal and who begins retransmission of the local signal affiliated with the same network to submit the required list and statement to the network within 60 days. Requires the FCC to report to the relevant congressional committees, for purposes of identifying if a household is unserved by an adequate digital signal, on whether Federal statutes and regulations relating to the digital strength standard or the testing procedures should be revised to take into account the types of antennas that are available to consumers. (Sec. 205) Requires a satellite carrier that offers a distant signal to a grandfathered subscriber to: (1) notify such subscribers within the later of 60 days after the local signal affiliated with the same network is available or 60 days after enactment of this Act that a local signal is available; (2) offer to substitute the local signal for the distant signal; (3) inform the subscriber that failure to respond within 60 days will result in the loss of the distant signal; and (4) switch the subscriber to the local signal if such subscriber elects a switch or fails to respond. Requires the FCC to revise the regulations relating to notice to television broadcast stations of a satellite carrier's intention to commence carriage of signals of that station to the local market. Requires a satellite carrier that proposes to commence the retransmission of the signal of a significantly viewed station to give any local television broadcast station 60 days notice. (Sec. 206) Requires a satellite carrier to notify a subscriber at the time of entering an agreement, and annually thereafter, in a separate written statement which clearly and conspicuously informs the subscriber of: (1) the nature of personally identifiable information to be collected and its use; (2) the nature, frequency and purpose of any disclosure which may be made of such information; (3) the period such information will be maintained by the satellite carrier; (4) the time and place at which the subscriber may have access to such information; and (5) the limitations provided by this Act and the subscribers right to enforce such limitations. Prohibits a satellite carrier from using any of its facilities to collect a subscriber's personally identifiable information without the prior consent of the subscriber, but allows the satellite carrier to collect such information to: (1) render a service to the subscriber; or (2) detect unauthorized reception of satellite communications. Prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable subscriber information. Requires a satellite carrier to prevent unauthorized access to such information. Allows a satellite carrier to disclose such information: (1) if necessary to render or conduct a legitimate business activity related to a service provided; (2) pursuant to a court order if the subscriber is notified; (3) to any satellite or other service, with specified limitations; or (4) to an authorized government entity, except that such information may not include records revealing satellite subscriber selection of video programming. Requires the satellite carrier to: (1) provide a subscriber access to all personally identifiable information about the subscriber collected and maintained by the carrier; (2) give such subscriber an opportunity to correct such information; and (3) destroy such information if the information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected and there are no pending requests or orders for access to it. Sets forth penalties for violations of this section, including punitive damages and attorney's fees. (Sec. 207) Prohibits, until January 1, 2010, a multichannel video programming distributor from failing to negotiate in good faith for retransmission consent. Provides that it is not a failure to negotiate in good faith if the distributor enters into retransmission consent agreements containing different terms and conditions with different broadcast stations based on competitive marketplace considerations. (Sec. 208) Requires the FCC to report to the relevant congressional committees on the impact on competition in the multichannel video programming distribution market of the current retransmission consent, network nonduplication, syndicated exclusivity, and sports blackout rules, including the impact of those rules on the ability of rural cable operators to compete with the direct broadcast satellite industry in the provision of digital broadcast television signals to subscribers. (Sec. 209) Requires the FCC to exempt requests for a signal intensity test by a subscriber eligible to receive retransmissions of local signals from the requirement to verify the signal by means of an independent test. Allows a subscriber in a local market in which the satellite carrier does not offer local signals to conduct a signal intensity test by an approved tester at the subscriber's own expense. (Sec. 210) Requires a satellite carrier that offers multichannel video programming distribution service in the United States to more than 5 million subscribers: (1) within one year, to retransmit the analog signal of each television broadcast station located in any local market within a State that is not part of the contiguous United States; and (2) within 30 months, to retransmit digital signals of each such station. Requires that: (1) retransmission of such stations be made available to substantially all of the satellite carrier's subscribers in each station's local market; and (2) the retransmissions of the stations in at least one market in the State be made available to substantially all of the satellite carrier's subscribers in areas of that State that are not within a designated market area. Provides that the cost to subscribers of such retransmissions shall not exceed the cost of retransmissions of local television stations in other States. Requires the FCC to promulgate regulations concerning the elections by television stations in such State between mandatory carriage and retransmission consent, which shall take into account the schedule on which local television stations are made available to viewers in such State. (Sec. 211) Allows a satellite carrier to retransmit to subscribers in an eligible county in a State: (1) any television broadcast stations in that State that any cable operator or satellite carrier was retransmitting to subscribers in the county on January 1, 2004; or (2) up to two television broadcast stations located in the State if the number of television broadcast stations under clause (1) is less than three. Defines an \"eligible county\" to mean any one of four counties that: (1) are in a single State; (2) were each in designated market areas in which the majority of counties were located in another State or States on January 1, 2004; and (3) as a group had a combined total of 41,340 television households for 2003-2004. (Sec. 212) Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to impair the FCC's authority, or require the FCC, to take any action with respect to the transition by television broadcasters to the digital television service.
