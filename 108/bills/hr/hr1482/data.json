Requires the funds to support specified activities, including: (1) direct financial and programmatic assistance to the Ministry of Women's Affairs in Afghanistan to promote its strengthening and enable it to fulfill its mandate; (2) direct financial assistance to the National Human Rights Commission of Afghanistan; and (3) construction of women's educational facilities in Afghanistan. Earmarks a minimum percentage of the economic and humanitarian assistance authorized for Afghanistan for each of FY 2003 though 2005 to be made available for assistance directly to Afghan-led local nongovernmental organizations, including Afghan women-led organizations, with demonstrated experience in delivering services to Afghan women and children to support their programmatic activities and organizational development. Requires an appropriate percentage of such assistance for FY 2006 and each subsequent fiscal year to be made available to such organizations. Prescribes general requirements with respect to Afghanistan for: (1) its governance; (2) post-conflict stability; (3) training for military and police forces; and (4) relief, resettlement, and repatriation of refugees and internally displaced persons."
