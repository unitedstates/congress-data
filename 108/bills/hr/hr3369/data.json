States that this exemption shall not be construed to affect civil actions brought by nonprofit athletic organizations against their employees, agents, or volunteers. Makes exceptions where State law: (1) requires such an organization to adhere to risk management procedures, including mandatory training; (2) makes the organization liable for the acts or omissions of its employees, agents, and volunteers to the same extent as an employer is liable for its employees; and (3) makes a limitation of liability inapplicable if the civil action was brought by an officer of a State or local government. Preempts inconsistent State laws except for those that provide additional protections from liability relating to the rule-making activities of nonprofit athletic organizations."
