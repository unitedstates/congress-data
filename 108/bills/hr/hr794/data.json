Extends from ten years to twenty years the lease term for which advance royalties may be accepted in lieu of the condition of continued operation.Eliminates the deadline for submission of a coal lease operation and reclamation plan.Prohibits the Secretary from requiring a surety bond or any other financial assurance to guarantee payment of deferred bonus bid installments with respect to any coal lease issued based upon a cash bonus bid.Requires the Secretary to review and identify for Congress coal assessments on public lands and the restrictions or impediments to development of those resources."
