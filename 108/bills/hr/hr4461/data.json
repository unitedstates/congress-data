Requires the Secretaries to: (1) contract with a third-party consultant with experience in park and land use planning to prepare a draft study; and (2) collaborate with the Forest Supervisor of the Coconino National Forest, the Superintendent of the Flagstaff Area National Monuments, the Flagstaff City Council, and Coconino County Board of Supervisors in developing a scope of work for the draft study under the guidance of the third-party consultant."
