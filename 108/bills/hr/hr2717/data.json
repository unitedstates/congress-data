Sets conditions for certification which shall protect consumers, including controls to protect patient privacy and confidentiality. States that certification shall be effective for one year but may be renewed. Allows the Secretary to terminate a certification. Prohibits an Internet or mail-order pharmacy: (1) displaying a seal of certification without in fact being certified; or (2) making a false claim of certification. Adds provisions concerning the importation by individuals of prescription drugs from Canada under specified circumstances. Directs the Secretary to establish by regulation, for such circumstances, a waiver of prohibitions under the Act that apply to such drugs. Directs the Secretary to conduct studies regarding: (1) Internet and mail-order pharmacies claiming Canadian sources for prescription drugs; and (2) in-person personal importation from Canada."
