Allows a registered drug importation facility, pharmacy, Internet pharmacy, or wholesaler to import a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescription drug from Canada or a permitted country. Prohibits the commingling of domestic and imported prescription drugs. Requires a pharmacy or Internet pharmacy that dispenses an imported prescription drug to label such drug accordingly. Allows individuals to import prescription drugs from: (1) a registered Internet pharmacy; or (2) licensed pharmacies for personal use. Allows the Secretary to suspend importation of a particular drug from a particular facility, pharmacy, wholesaler, or country. Allows licensed Internet pharmacies to dispense prescription drugs. Sets forth licensing requirements for Internet pharmacies. Makes interactive computer service providers and advertising service providers liable for violations under this Act if such a provider accepts advertising: (1) for a prescription drug from an unlicensed Internet pharmacy; or (2) stating that an individual does not need a prescription to obtain a prescription drug. Requires the Secretary to: (1) require the adoption and use of electronic track and trace technology to identify each sale, purchase, or trade of a prescription drug; and (2) establish a network to provide prompt notification of counterfeit drugs and to facilitate the identification and reporting of such drugs. Sets forth requirements for wholesalers, including requirements to identify the immediately previous distributor of record and all previous sales, purchases, or trades for imported prescription drugs."
