    "text": "Marine Mammal Preservation and Recovery Act of 2003 - Amends the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) to redefine marine mammal \"harassment\" in a manner that takes into account cumulative effects of behavioral changes. Requires the Marine Mammal Commission to establish a captive marine mammal care and maintenance standards advisory committee. Prohibits marine mammal traveling exhibits. Limits the import and export of marine mammal products to the cultural exchanges or noncommercial activities of specified groups. Amends the John H. Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Program to provide financial assistance for certain stranding events. Adds entanglement events to data collection, response agreement, and responder liability requirements (currently applicable to stranding events). Expands the marine mammal research grant program to include research into ecosystems. Enhances penalties for MMPA violations. Prohibits the obstruction of MMPA-related enforcement activities. Authorizes research and grant programs for the nonlethal control of nuisance pinnipeds (seals and sea lions). Requires the Secretary of Commerce to: (1) issue final regulations on deterring marine mammals; (2) publish and implement a ship strike reduction plan for North Atlantic right whales; and (3) reconvene the regional scientific review groups authorized by the MMPA to advise the Secretary on stock assessments. Requires the Chairman of the Marine Mammal Commission to report to the Secretaries of Commerce and of the Interior, specified congressional committees, and the public on emerging threats to marine mammals. Modifies commercial fishing vessel registration requirements. Requires the Secretary to develop and implement a take reduction plan for each strategic stock that interacts with a fishery. Authorizes the Secretary to establish voluntary fishing gear buyback and research mini-grant programs to foster the use of gear that reduces the incidental taking of marine mammals."
