    "text": "Acid Rain Control Act - Amends the Clean Air Act to require further reductions in total annual emissions of sulfur dioxide by utility units and nitrogen oxides by facilities with one or more combustion units serving at least one electricity generator with a capacity of at least 25 megawatts. Permits emissions trading and allocation.Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate regulations controlling electric utility and industrial source emissions of mercury. Prohibits mercury emission allowance transfers.Requires that these emissions regulations prevent localized adverse effects and ensure significant reductions on both coasts.Directs the Administrator to identify for and report to Congress on scientifically credible environmental indicators sufficient to protect sensitive ecosystems of the Adirondack, mid-Appalachian, Rocky and Southern Blue Ridge Mountains as well as the Great Lakes, Lake Champlain, Long Island Sound, and the Chesapeake Bay."
