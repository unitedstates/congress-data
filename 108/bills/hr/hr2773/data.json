    "text": "Food Choking Prevention Act of 2003 - Directs the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to establish an Office of Choking Hazard Evaluation to require warning labels on food primarily consumed by children that pose a demonstrably high choking risk. Authorizes the Office to require informational labels on food consumed by children that pose a demonstrably high choking risk. Grants the Office mandatory recall authority over food determined to pose a significant and unacceptable choking hazard to the general public. Requires the Office to: (1) provide educational materials on food choking hazards, precautions, and life-saving procedures for pediatricians and hospitals to distribute to patients aged 14 and younger; and (2) designate one week a year as \"National Child Food Choking Prevention Week\" and widely publicize choking hazards and life-saving procedures during that week. Mandates establishment of a Choking Hazard Evaluation Task Force to staff establish criteria to determine whether a food poses a significant and unacceptable choking hazard. Directs the FDA to: (1) ensure the operation of a national database of food choking incidents; and (2) provide a reporting system throughout its field offices, which the health care profession and the general public can readily access to report new incidents."
