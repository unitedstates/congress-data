Requires such administrative units to: (1) plan and implement projects to enhance the forest health of Westside Forest land managed by the administrative unit; and (2) prioritize projects so that significant acreage identified in the inventory are planned for treatment, and treatment has begun, before planning other projects. Sets forth priorities for such projects. Prohibits such administrative units from planning, advertising, contracting or implementing any harvest of timber for matrix land containing old growth stands, except for noncommercial use or noncommercial purposes in an emergency situation. Allows such administrative units to prepare programmatic environmental documentation pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to study the significant environmental effects of the major Federal actions contemplated in projects authorized by this Act."
