Sets forth requirements for: (1) a prohibition against the IMF's requiring any country receiving new concessional loans to privilege the IMF as a creditor over the United States; (2) establishment of a framework to ensure the transparency regarding each international financial institution's activities; and (3) availability on the Treasury Department's website of U.S. Executive Directors' remarks at meetings of international financial institutions' Boards of Directors. Requires the Secretary to commence immediate efforts, within the Paris Club, the IMF, and other appropriate MDI's, to ensure that the provision of debt cancellation to such countries is not conditioned on any agreement by such a country to implement or comply with specified policies that deepen poverty or degrade the environment. Bars funds appropriated in any Act (except those providing for debt relief to poor countries) from being obligated or made available to IMF unless specified conditions are met relating to debt cancellation for all eligible poor countries and termination of conditioning debt relief on certain structural adjustment."
