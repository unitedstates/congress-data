Directs the Secretary to make such determination with regard to each State within one year after enactment of this Act. Requires such a system to be one under which the State shares with the Federal Government information (including for non-criminal justice purposes) on each arrest, charge, or conviction (including any no contest plea) in such State for specified covered offenses. Requires such information to include the identity of: (1) each individual so arrested, charged, or convicted; and (2) the identity of each individual under suspicion for such an offense. Requires such system to cover any offense that: (1) is a felony or involves violence, a controlled substance, child abuse, statutory rape, rape, molestation, or sexual abuse; and (2) occurs on or after the date that is 15 years before the date of the enactment of this Act."
