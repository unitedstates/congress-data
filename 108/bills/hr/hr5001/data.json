Establishes within NORLC an interagency program office (OceanUS) which shall be responsible for program planning and coordination of the IOOS. Requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to be the lead Federal agency for implementation and operation of the IOOS. Requires regional associations to be responsible for the development and operation of regional ocean and coastal observing systems to meet the information needs of the users groups in the region while adhering to national standards."
