Revises the requirement that an airport owner or operator, who has come to an agreement with a person who owns an aircraft that a hangar is to be constructed at the airport for the aircraft at the aircraft owner's expense, will grant to the aircraft owner a long-term lease for the hangar. Adds a requirement that such a lease be for a term of not less than 75 years (currently, there is no minimum)."
