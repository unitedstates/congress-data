Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, to: (1) fully and appropriately use such funds to regulate dietary supplements; (2) report annually on DSHEA implementation and enforcement; (3) carry out programs to educate health professionals and consumers on the safety and health benefits of the dietary supplements, including the potential for interactions of dietary supplements and drugs (using specified funds authorized by this Act); and (4) establish a system for the requirements for the reporting of serious adverse experiences associated with the use of a dietary supplement received by the manufacturer, packer, or distributor whose name appears on the label of the product. Expresses the sense of the Congress regarding dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids."
