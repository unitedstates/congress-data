Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to transfer to the Administrator increasing percentages of funds otherwise apportioned to a State out of the Highway Trust Fund from any State that does not enact laws to prohibit driving under the influence of an illegal drug. Requires transferred funds to be used to carry out NHTSA duties. Requires the Secretary, if any funds are transferred to the Administrator, to transfer to the Administrator also a calculated amount of obligation authority distributed for the fiscal year to the State for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs."
