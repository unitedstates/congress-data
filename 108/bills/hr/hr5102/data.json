Directs the President to apply specified entry, asset seizure, and investment sanctions to Ukraine until the President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that Ukraine has: (1) implemented free and transparent elections for president and Parliament; (2) stopped harassment and repression against the media, independent trade unions, nongovernmental organizations, religious organizations, and the political opposition; and (3) stopped politically motivated legal charges against opposition figures and independent journalists. Authorizes the President to waive such sanctions if: (1) in the national interest; or (2) a new president is elected in Ukraine in 2004 who has corrected election abuses."
