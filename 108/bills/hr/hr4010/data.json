Removes from program objectives the development of a geophysical- and geochemical- map database. Directs that mapping priorities be based in part on the needs of the Department of the Interior land management agencies. Modifies the composition of the advisory committee. Directs that the national geologic database include information on how to obtain specified maps, databases, and data, including all maps developed with funding provided under the national cooperative geologic mapping program. Authorizes appropriations for each of FY 2006 through 2010. Increases the percentages allocated for the State and education components."
