    "text": "Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn Crime Victims' Rights Act - Amends the Federal criminal code to provide that a crime victim has the following rights: (1) to be reasonably protected from the accused; (2) to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public proceeding involving the crime or of any release or escape of the accused and to not be excluded from any such proceeding; (3) to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding involving release, plea, or sentencing; (4) to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case; (5) to full and timely restitution as provided in law; (6) to proceedings free from unreasonable delay; and (7) to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy. Directs: (1) the court to ensure that a victim is afforded these rights; (2) officers and employees of Federal agencies engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime to make their best efforts to see that victims are notified of, and accorded, these rights; and (3) the Attorney General to promulgate regulations to enforce victims' rights and to ensure compliance by responsible officials with the obligations respecting crime victims. Amends the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 to authorize the Director of the Office for Victims of Crime to make grants to: (1) develop, establish, and maintain programs for the enforcement of victims' rights; and (2) develop and implement state-of-the-art systems for notifying victims of important dates and developments relating to criminal proceedings. Requires: (1) the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to report annually on the number of times such victims' rights are asserted and the relief requested is denied; and (2) the Comptroller General to evaluate the effect of this Act on the treatment of victims."
