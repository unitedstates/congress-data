Revises guidelines governing: (1) the availability of moneys from the Fund: (2) the disposition of unappropriated Fund balances; (3) transfers to the United Mine Workers of America Combined Benefit Fund; and (4) submission of quarterly reports by operators of surface coal mining operations. Revises requirements governing allocation of funds and allocation of funds to states and Indian tribes. Prescribes guidelines for initial program sites and bond forfeiture sites with insolvent sureties. Revises requirements for the granting of funds to set forth guidelines governing: (1) the application processing deadline; (2) the disposition of unexpended funds; and (3) a state set-aside program. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to require that states assume responsibility for administering the emergency reclamation program in order to remain eligible to receive grants. Authorizes the Secretary to propose regulations prescribing conditions under which the Fund would be used to promote remining of eligible lands, including reclamation fee rebates or waivers and other incentives."
