    "text": "Amends the Controlled Substances Act to modify the definition of \"immediate precursor\" to include a substance which the Attorney General has designated as the immediate chemical precursor of an anabolic steroid that has been scheduled as a controlled substance which either is a metabolite of a scheduled anabolic steroid or is transformed in the body directly into a scheduled anabolic steroid or the metabolite of a scheduled anabolic steroid.Authorizes the Attorney General to place the immediate precursor of a scheduled anabolic steroid in the same schedule as that anabolic steroid or in any other schedule with a higher numerical designation (without regard to specified requirements, including the requirement that a substance promote muscle growth). States that once such an immediate precursor is placed in a schedule, it becomes a controlled substance and the Attorney General may schedule an immediate precursor of that substance.Authorizes the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy to undertake education programs at the grade and high school levels to highlight the harmful effects of steroids and steroid precursor use by youths. Requires the Director to use funds made available for such programs for existing State and local anti-drug programs, primarily for education programs that directly communicate with teachers, principals, coaches, and children at the school level on the harmful effects of steroids and steroid precursors."
