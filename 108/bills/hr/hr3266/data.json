    "date": "2004-06-21", 
    "text": "Faster and Smarter Funding for First Responders Act of 2004 - (Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) establish clearly defined essential capabilities for State and local government preparedness for terrorism for purposes of covered grants (i.e., any grant provided by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to States, regions, or directly eligible tribes to improve the ability of first responders to prevent, prepare for, respond to, or mitigate terrorist attacks, including any grant under DHS's State Homeland Security Grant Program or Urban Area Security Initiative); and (2) establish (within 30 days after receipt of the initial submission of a final report) and regularly update (at least every three years) essential capabilities. Defines \"directly eligible tribe\" to mean any Indian tribe or consortium of tribes that: (1) meets the criteria to participate in self-governance set forth in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act; (2) employs at least ten full-time personnel in a law enforcement or emergency response agency with the capacity to respond to calls for law enforcement or emergency services; and (3) is located on or within five miles of an international border or waterway, within five miles of a facility within a critical infrastructure sector, or within or contiguous to one of the 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas, or has more than 1,000 square miles of Indian country. Directs the Secretary to ensure that essential capabilities are provided promptly to Congress and to the States (which shall make such capabilities available to local governments) and that such capabilities meet objectives for: (1) specificity regarding the training, planning, personnel, and equipment that different types of communities should have to meet DHS's goals for terrorism preparedness based upon the most current terrorism risk assessment available; (2) flexibility to allow State and local government officials to set priorities based on particular needs, while reaching nationally determined terrorism preparedness levels within a specified period; and (3) measurability of progress towards specific terrorism preparedness goals. Directs the Secretary, in establishing essential capabilities, to specifically consider the variables of threat, vulnerability, and consequences with respect to the Nation's population and critical infrastructure based upon the most current terrorism risk assessment available by the Directorate for Information Analysis and Infrasturcture Protection. Directs the Secretary to specifically consider terrorism threats against the following U.S. critical infrastructure sectors: (1) agriculture; (2) banking and finance; (3) chemical industries; (4) the defense industrial base; (5) emergency services; (6) energy; (7) food; (8) government; (9) postal and shipping; (10) public health; (11) information and telecommunications networks; (12) transportation; (13) water; and (14) courts and justice facilities. Directs the Secretary to establish the Task Force on Essential Capabilities for First Responders. Requires the Task Force to submit to the Secretary triennial reports on essential capabilities of State and local government responders regarding terrorism preparedness, prevention, protection, response, and mitigation. Directs the Task Force to specifically consider critical infrastructure sectors and threats, including: (1) biological, nuclear, radiological, incendiary, chemical, and cyber threats; (2) explosives; (3) suicide bombers; and (4) any other threats based on proximity to specific past acts of terrorism or the known activity of any terrorist group. Makes any State, region, or directly eligible tribe eligible to apply for a covered grant. Directs the Secretary, in awarding covered grants, to assist States and local governments in achieving the essential capabilities for first responders. Directs that for purposes of awarding covered grants, credibility of the threat shall be weighted more than population concentration, critical infrastructure, or any other consideration.

Authorizes the Secretary to pay a local government, upon request, a portion of the amount awarded to a State for such government to use to expedite planned terrorism preparedness enhancements if the State has failed to pass through funds or resources. Requires the Secretary to submit an annual report to Congress by December 31 of each year on the amount of Federal funds provided as covered grants to each State and region, the use of such grant funds, and the extent to which essential capabilities were created or enhanced or remain unmet, and an estimate of Federal, State, and local expenditures required to attain such capabilities across the United States. Directs the Secretary to support the development of, promulgate, and update national voluntary consensus standards for: (1) the performance, use, and validation of first responder equipment, which shall be consistent with existing standards, take into account new types of terrorism threats, and focus on maximizing interoperability, interchangeability, durability, flexibility, efficiency, efficacy, portability, sustainability, and safety; and (2) first responder training under covered grant programs that will enable State and local government first responders to achieve optimal levels of terrorism preparedness as quickly as practicable.

(Sec. 6) Provides that this Act supersedes provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act regarding the allocation of grant funds for State and local domestic preparedness support. (Sec. 7) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) interoperable emergency communications systems and radios should be deployed as soon as practicable for use by the first responder community, and upgraded and new digital communications systems and new digital radios must meet prevailing national, voluntary consensus standards for interoperability; and (2) individual Citizen Corps councils should seek to enhance the preparedness and response capabilities of all organizations participating in the councils, including by providing funding to as many of their participating organizations as practicable to promote local terrorism preparedness programs.
