Exempts from such provision: (1) a handler operating an exempt plant; or (2) a producer-handler for any month during which packaged fluid milk route dispositions and sales to other plants are less than six million pounds of milk.Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act, reenacted with amendments by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, to subject a Class I milk handler in the Arizona-Las Vegas marketing area to minimum milk price requirements for any month in which the handler distributes in such area at least six million pounds of Class I products from his or her own production."
