Authorizes the bankruptcy court, upon request of a party in interest or a committee of creditors, to allow such party or committee to commence and prosecute specified proceedings if the trustee either consents, or fails to commence such proceedings, and if the court finds that doing so is in the best interest of the estate and for the benefit of the estate."
