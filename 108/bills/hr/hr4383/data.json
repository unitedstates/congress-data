Defines mitigation fishery cost as the expenditures necessary to operate, maintain, and rehabilitate facilities to conduct mitigation fishery activities, including the rearing and stocking of native and nonnative fish to replace or maintain harvest levels lost as a result of Federal water resource development projects."
