Directs the Secretary of the Treasury, at the request of the plaintiff, to pay from the Treasury, but not exceeding the sum of Iraqi blocked funds that were vested by Executive Order 13290 of March 20, 2003, any judgment in Civil Action No. 02-0632 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia brought by U.S. prisoners of war and their families against the Republic of Iraq, the Iraqi Intelligence Service, and Saddam Hussein for the brutal torture of them during the First Gulf War. Declares that it shall be U.S. policy to support the claims of U.S. prisoners of war and their families against the Republic of Iraq if, following the Second Gulf War, it becomes evident that U.S. prisoners of war have been killed, tortured, or mistreated during that war, or that the unaccounted-or U.S. prisoner of war from the First Gulf War was killed or tortured by Iraq."
