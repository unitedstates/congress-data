Authorizes citizen suits concerning food additives against the alleged violator or against the Secretary for failure to perform a mandatory act or duty under this Act.Mandates a fee from petitioners to cover related costs and to provide for a program of basic and applied research on genetic food additive safety.Authorizes the detention (seizure) of food as well as devices during an inspection where the appropriate officer or employee of the Department of Health and Human Services has reason to believe such food or device is in violation of this Act. Requires all food retailers to register with the Food and Drug Administration to expedite recalls, embargoes, and seizures."
