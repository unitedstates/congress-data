Limits such authority to a check of an individual who: (1) resided with a minor at the time of an actual or alleged incident of abuse or neglect of that minor, or at the time during which such an incident may have occurred; or (2) is the subject of an investigation relating to an incident of abuse or neglect of a minor. Requires the Attorney General to ensure that such an officer has the authority for \"read only\" electronic access to the NCIC databases for the purpose of carrying out checks of records relating to missing persons or warrants. Directs such officer to use access only for an investigation relating to a missing child and to share any information obtained with appropriate Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies. Directs the Attorney General to ensure that the Case Analysis Division, the Missing Children's Division, and the Exploited Child Unit of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children each have access to the Index, subject to specified limitations. Limits the release of information. Sets criminal penalties for knowingly releasing information in violation of this Act."
