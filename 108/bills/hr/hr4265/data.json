    "text": "Protects business entities from civil liability under Federal and State law for any injury or death resulting from: (1) the use of equipment donated to nonprofit organizations by such entities; (2) the authorized use of facilities made available to nonprofit organizations by such entities where the use occurs outside the scope of business; or (3) the authorized operation of aircraft or motor vehicles loaned to nonprofit organizations by such entities for use outside the scope of business. Creates an exception for injuries or death resulting from a business entity's gross negligence or intentional misconduct. Preempts inconsistent State laws unless such laws provide additional protection for business entities or the State elects not to be covered by this Act. Makes the provisions of this Act inapplicable to civil actions in State court where all parties are citizens of the State and the State has opted out of coverage by such election."
