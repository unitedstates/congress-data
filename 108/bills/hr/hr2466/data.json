    "text": "Iran Freedom and Democracy Support Act - Declares it to be U.S. policy to: (1) support democracy and freedom in Iran; (2) support an internationally-monitored referendum by which the Iranian people can peacefully change the system of government in Iran; and (3) help the Iranian people achieve a free press and a free, democratic society. Directs the Broadcasting Board of Governors to: (1) require the head of Radio Farda to develop programming in consultation with Iranian exiles who support such a referendum and with the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) at the Department of State; and (2) ensure that a significant percentage of Radio Farda programming discusses democratic change in Iran. Requires the MEPI and ECA to provide grants for the translation and distribution of materials on democracy for the Iranian people. Authorizes the MEPI and ECA to award grants to fund programs and activities to promote a democratic referendum in Iran. Prohibits the importation of any textile or food article from Iran until the President certifies that Iran has shown substantial progress in respecting human rights, ceased its support for international terrorism, and terminated its nuclear weapons program. Authorizes the reduction in amounts available for U.S. contributions to international financial institutions that provide assistance to Iran in an amount equal to such assistance, and the reallocation of such contributions to the U.S. Agency for International Development for child survival and HIV/AIDS programs, until the President provides the certification referenced above. Requires the President to report to Congress on the presence of al Qaeda elements in Iran."
