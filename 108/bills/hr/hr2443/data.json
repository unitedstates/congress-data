    "text": "Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2004 - Title I: Authorization - (Sec. 101) Authorizes appropriations for FY 2005 for the Coast Guard (CG), under the categories of: (1) CG operation and maintenance, with a portion from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (Fund) for certain purposes under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA); (2) acquisition, construction, rebuilding, and improvement of aids to navigation, shore and offshore facilities, vessels, and aircraft, including related equipment; (3) research, development, test, and evaluation of technologies, materials, and human factors directly relating to improving CG performance in search and rescue, aids to navigation, marine safety, marine environmental protection, enforcement of laws and treaties, ice operations, oceanographic research, and defense readiness; (4) retired pay, payments under the Retired Serviceman's Family Protection and Survivor Benefit Plans, and payments for medical care of retired personnel and their dependents; (5) alteration or removal of bridges constituting obstructions to navigation, and personnel and administrative costs associated with the Bridge Alteration Program (with a portion of such funds for construction of a new Chelsea Street Bridge over the Chelsea River in Boston, Massachusetts); (6) environmental compliance and restoration at CG facilities; and (7) maintenance and operation of facilities, supplies, equipment, and services for the CG Reserve. (Sec. 102) Authorizes a CG end-of-year strength of 45,500 active duty military personnel for FY 2004 and FY 2005. Authorizes average military training student loads for FY 2005 in specified numbers under the categories of Recruit/Special, Flight, Professional, and Officer. Title II: Coast Guard Management - (Sec. 201) Authorizes the CG Commandant (Commandant) to enter into leases of up to 20 years (currently, five years) for CG property with: (1) the CG Academy Alumni Association to construct an alumni visitor facility at the CG Academy; and (2) non-Federal entities to carry out cooperative agreements under the Ports and Waterways Safety Act. (Sec. 202) Authorizes the Coast Guard Exchange System or a CG morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) system (equivalent to Department of Defense nonappropriated fund instrumentalities) to enter into contracts or other agreements with other departments, agencies, or instrumentalities of the CG or another Federal agency to provide goods and services beneficial to their efficient management and operation. (Sec. 203) Authorizes the Commandant to accept original enlistments for other than full years, and reenlistments for any term of years and months from two to six years. (Sec. 204) Authorizes the CG to offer an incentive bonus to enlisted members who complete training in a skill designated as critical, provided at least four years of obligated active service remain on the member's enlistment at the time the training is completed. (Sec. 205) Revises the conditions under which the person in command or in charge of an authorized CG vessel or aircraft displaying the prescribed ensign, pennant, or other identifying insignia may fire at or into any vessel, liable to seizure or examination, which does not stop on being ordered to do so or on being pursued. Eliminates the requirement of a prior warning shot as a condition precedent for indemnification from damages resulting from the use of disabling fire, if a warning shot would unreasonably endanger persons or property in the vessel's vicinity. Extends CG interdiction authority to any military aircraft on which one or more CG members are assigned. Requires the Commandant to report annually to specified congressional committees on the location, vessels or aircraft, circumstances, and consequences of each incident in which the person in command of an authorized vessel or aircraft fired at or into a vessel without prior use of a warning shot. (Sec. 206) Revises Federal law to authorize the Secretary of the department in which the CG is operating to: (1) recover from the person liable for a user fee or charge the costs of collecting delinquent payments as well as associated enforcement costs; and (2) employ any Federal, State, or local agency or instrumentality, or any private enterprise or business, to collect user fees or charges (including the reasonable administrative, accounting, personnel, contract, equipment, supply, training, and travel expenses of calculating, assessing, collecting, enforcing, reviewing, adjusting, and reporting on a fee or charge). (Sec. 207) Gives the CG direct loan authority for acquisition and construction of housing. Authorizes multiple demonstration projects, which may be conducted at any CG installation in Alaska, to acquire or construct military family or unaccompanied housing through contracts with Alaska-based small business concerns qualified under the Small Business Administration's section 8(a) program. (Current law authorizes one such demonstration project only in Kodiak, Alaska.) Authorizes the Commandant to make differential lease payments if necessary to encourage private construction of CG housing. (Sec. 208) Reduces from three years to one year the minimum required amount of constructive credit to be given a CG Reserve Law Specialist upon assignment or designation. (Sec. 209) Lowers from 62 to 60 the maximum age for retention in an active status as a CG Reserve officer (mandatory retirement age). (Sec. 210) Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) require that travel or transportation allowances due a CG civilian employee or military member be disbursed directly to the issuer of a Federal contractor-issued travel charge card, but only in an amount not to exceed the authorized travel expenses the employee or member charged; and (2) reduce or withhold from the pay or retired pay of a CG employee, member, or retired member any delinquent amounts owed by them. (Sec. 211) Directs the Secretary to: (1) review the Commandant Instruction 5730.3, regarding congressional detailees (COMDTINST 5370.3), dated April 18, 2003, and compare the standards it sets forth to the standards applied by other executive agencies to congressional detailees; (2) determine if any changes to such instruction are necessary to protect against conflicts of interest and preserve the doctrine of separation of powers; and (3) report to specified congressional committees on the findings and conclusions of the review. (Sec. 212) Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to enter into lease agreements of up to 20 years to acquire real property or interests for special purpose facilities (facilities used to carry out CG aviation, maritime, or navigation missions other than general purpose office and storage space facilities). (Sec. 213) Authorizes the Commandant to establish a National Coast Guard Museum, which may be located in New London, Connecticut. Prohibits use of Federal funds in engineering, design, or construction of the Museum. Requires the CG to fund the operation and maintenance of the Museum with nonappropriated and non-Federal funds to the maximum extent practicable. Urges priority use of Federal operation and maintenance funds to preserve and protect historic CG artifacts. Requires submission of an operation and maintenance plan to a specified congressional committee before the Museum is established. Requires estimated costs and proposed funding sources to be certified as reasonable and realistic by the Inspector General of the Department in which the CG is operating. (Sec. 214) Increases from 6,200 to 6,700 the limit on the total number of commissioned active duty CG officers for FY 2004 through 2006. Revises the distribution of commissioned CG officers due promotion for the grade of commander and lieutenant commander. (Sec. 215) Directs the Commandant to notify the Committee at least 180 days before implementing a plan to change the boundaries of CG districts, or before permanently transferring more than ten percent of the personnel or equipment from a district office where they are based. (Sec. 216) Directs the Commandant to issue a report on the necessity of, and possible standards for, decking materials for CG vessels to mitigate the adverse effects on crew members from shock and vibration. (Sec. 218) Authorizes the Secretary of Education to provide for the repayment of a certain portion of educational loans of active duty CG members under the CG Education Loan Repayment Program. (Sec. 219) Increases the amount the Commandant may expend for contingencies of the CG to no more than $50,000 in any one fiscal year. (Sec. 220) Revises requirements for removal from active status of a reserve rear admiral or rear admiral (lower half) after completion of four years of service. Provides that such reserve officers may serve a full four-year term. (Sec. 221) Increases the maximum amount appropriated per annum for necessary expenses for CG confidential investigative expenses of a confidential character. (Sec. 222) Authorizes the Commandant to consult with the Office of Naval Research and other Federal agencies with research and development (R&D) programs that may provide innovative construction alternatives for the Integrated Deepwater System. (Sec. 223) Authorizes the President to delegate port security authority to the Secretary of the department in which the CG is operating. (Sec. 224) Requires the Commandant: (1) in preparing the CG's annual fisheries enforcement plan, to consult with the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and with State and local enforcement authorities; (2) prior to undertaking fisheries patrol, to notify the Under Secretary and appropriate State and local enforcement authorities of the projected dates for such patrols; and (3) to prepare and make available to the Under Secretary, State and local enforcement entities, and other relevant stakeholders, an annual summary report of fisheries enforcement activities for the preceding year, including a summary of the number of patrols, law enforcement actions taken, and resource hours expended. (Sec. 225) Authorizes the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the department in which the CG is operating (when operating other than as a service in the Navy) to provide child care services to members of the armed forces, with reimbursement (but this is not required), in CG and military child development centers supported in whole or in part with appropriated funds. (Sec. 226) Declares that personal property of the CG Auxiliary shall not be considered U.S. property, except for liability purposes (unless the the property is being used outside the scope of the Auxiliary mission). Title III: Navigation - (Sec. 301) Gives the CG the right to grant a waiver to allow a sunken wreck not to be marked with a lighted buoy at night. Authorizes the Commandant to waive the requirement to mark a wrecked vessel, raft, or other craft with a light at night if the Commandant determines that placing a light would be impracticable and granting such a waiver would not create an undue hazard to navigation. (Sec. 302) Amends the Ports and Waterways Safety Act (PWSA) to authorize the Secretary of the department in which the CG is operating to prohibit the use on vessels of electric and electronic devices that interfere with communication or navigation equipment, if they pose a threat to vessel safety. Declares that such authority, however, shall not apply to electric and electronic devices certified to transmit in the maritime services by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and used within specified frequency bands. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to enter into cooperative agreements with non-Federal entities to carry out PWSA vessel operating requirements, including vessel traffic services. (Sec. 303) Amends the Inland Navigational Rules Act of 1980 to repeal the Inland Navigational Rules. Authorizes the Secretary of the department in which the CG is operating to promulgate inland navigation regulations. (Thus allows for future changes to the Inland Navigation Rules through the regulatory process without the need for statutory changes.) (Sec. 304) Defines Secretary to mean Secretary of Transportation for purposes of the application of the PWSA to the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Title IV: Shipping - (Sec. 401) Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to require reports from vessel charterers (as well as from owners and masters) to ensure compliance with laws governing vessels engaged in coastwise trade and in the fisheries. (Sec. 402) Allows suspension as an alternative to the currently required revocation of a merchant mariner's credentials (MMCs) in cases of dangerous drug convictions. (Sec. 403) Eliminates a prohibition on general or public inspection of merchant mariners' documents. (Sec. 404) Exempts unmanned barges operating outside of U.S. waters from citizenship requirements regarding command of vessel. (Sec. 405) Requires foreign flag vessels departing and returning to the same U.S. port, or returning to another port under U.S. jurisdiction, to comply with the International Safety Management Code when any part of the voyage occurs on the high seas. (Sec. 406) Increases maximum civil penalties for failure to comply with recreational vessel and associated equipment safety standards. Extends such penalties to wrongful labeling and failure to notify of a recall. Sets forth both civil and criminal penalties for any person, including director, officer, or executive employee of a corporation, who knowingly and willfully fails to comply with an order to notify of defects, or comply with Federal standards, related to the safety of recreational vessel and associated equipment. (Sec. 407) Revises temporary suspension criteria in document suspension and revocation cases. Authorizes the CG to suspend temporarily or revoke MMCs if the mariner has been convicted of certain National Driver Register Act offenses. Authorizes temporary suspension of MMCs if the holder is a security risk that poses a threat to the security of a vessel or the port. (Sec. 408) Authorizes the CG to suspend or revoke MMCs if the mariner commits an act of incompetence with respect to the operation of a vessel whether or not the mariner is acting under the authority of the MMCs at the time the act occurs. Adds a security risk that poses a threat as a basis for which the Secretary of Transportation may suspend or revoke MMC. (Sec. 409) Authorizes the Secretary of the department in which the CG is operating to prescribe maximum hours of service for individuals engaged on a towing vessel of at least 26 feet in length that is required to have a licensed operator. Directs the Secretary, before prescribing such regulations, to conduct and report to Congress on a demonstration project involving the implementation of Crew Endurance Management Systems on these vessels. (Sec. 410) Requires certain vessels operating in U.S. waters to be equipped with and operate electronic charts. Authorizes certain exemptions from and waivers of such requirement. (Sec. 411) Revises the prohibition against the departure of a foreign vessel from a U.S. port with passengers who are embarked at that port, if the Secretary finds that the vessel does not comply with the standards stated in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) to which the United States Government is currently a party. Extends such prohibition to foreign vessels carrying a U.S. citizen as a passenger (thus allowing the CG to conduct SOLAS-compliance examinations of any foreign vessel carrying U.S. citizen passengers, not just those embarking passengers at a U.S. port). (Sec. 412) Allows a foreign national enrolled in the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy to operate aboard a vessel as an unlicensed seaman for purposes of fulfilling educational requirements for graduation from the Academy.
