Requires each State, as a condition of Federal grants and contracts, also to require all State-chartered corporations to submit such annual reports.Directs the Attorney General to establish a computerized registration program of all corporations found guilty of violating a Federal or State law. Authorizes the President to deny Federal contracts, loans, or loan guarantees to non-compliant corporations.Requires Federal agencies and commissions, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, to help establish and maintain conditions under which all adult Americans may freely exercise the economic rights specified in 1944 and in this Act. Prohibits Federal agencies or commissions from promoting recession, stagnation, or unemployment to reduce wages or inflation.Directs the President to establish a full employment framework for the annual budget submitted to the Congress that meets specified goals for: (1) quality of life and environment; (2) responsible, sustainable growth; (3) unemployment reduction; and (4) human rights.Requires the Joint Economic Committee to oversee actions under this Act and submit an annual Concurrent Resolution on Economic Policy setting forth its proposed employment goals."
