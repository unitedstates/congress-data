Prohibits participating insurers from limiting or denying coverage or increasing premiums for any of specified health factors.Directs the Secretary to establish standards for State-based reinsurance programs, and permits the Secretary to award grants to States to cover the costs of such programs.Directs the Secretary to establish the National Advisory Commission on Expanded Access to Health Care, which shall assess the effectiveness of programs designed to expand health care coverage or make such coverage affordable to otherwise uninsured individuals.Permits a State to apply to the Secretary for waivers of such provisions of law as may be necessary for the State to implement policies that make comprehensive, affordable health coverage available for all State residents."
