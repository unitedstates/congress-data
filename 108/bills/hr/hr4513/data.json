Provides that, in preparing an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement, such agency shall only consider public comments that specifically address the preferred action and that are filed within 20 days after publication of a draft environmental assessment or draft environmental impact statement. Defines \"renewable energy project,\" for purpose of this Act, as: (1) any proposal to utilize an energy source other than nuclear power, coal, oil, or natural gas; and (2) including but not limited to the use of wind, solar, geothermal, or tidal forces to generate energy."
