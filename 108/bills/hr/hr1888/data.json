Authorizes an agency head to: (1) withhold from such publication and disclosure any document classified for restricted access in accordance with an Executive order in the interest of national defense or foreign policy; and (2) redact any part so classified in a document not so classified before publication and disclosure of the document. Requires the agency head to make available an unredacted version of such a document to the chairman and ranking member of specified congressional committees."
