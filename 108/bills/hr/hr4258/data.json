Allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to contract with any firm or institution to conduct research and analysis needed for this report. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a system to rapidly: (1) establish clinical research programs to examine the safety and efficacy of treatments for novel, unknown, or bioengineered pathogens; and (2) disseminate results and recommendations to clinicians. Authorizes establishment of a fund to support such clinical research. Amends the Public Health Service Act to add the Secretary of Homeland Security to the working group on bioterrorism and to require the working group to assist in developing such a strategy. Requires the Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Defense, and Homeland Security to conduct programs to develop the capability to rapidly identify, develop, produce, and approve countermeasures."
