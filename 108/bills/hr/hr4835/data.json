Directs the Program Coordinator to: (1) construct a facility for administering the program; (2) conduct peer review of proposals and research results; (3) create a roadmap to identify the best projects and make determinations about which would most substantially improve the use of existing supplies; (4) coordinate budgets for projects at, and provide funding to, Regional Centers; (5) establish a transfer program to identify and facilitate full commercialization of promising projects; (6) implement crosscutting research to develop sensor and monitoring systems for water and energy efficiency and management; (7) establish a Water Supply Advisory Panel; and (8) provide competitive funding mechanisms to eligible institutions and individuals for projects. Designates the Utton Center at the University of New Mexico Law School as the National Water Policy Institute."
