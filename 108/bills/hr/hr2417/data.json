Requires consultation with the DCI in the appointment of the Assistant Secretary. (Sec. 106) Incorporates into this Act each requirement to submit a report to the congressional intelligence committees included in the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report for this bill. (Sec. 107) Directs the DCI to ensure that any report, review, study, or plan required under this Act that involves the intelligence or intelligence-related activities of the Departments of Defense or Energy is prepared or conducted in consultation with the Secretary of Defense or Energy, as appropriate. Requires all such reports, reviews, studies, or plans to be submitted to the congressional defense, appropriations, and intelligence committees. Title II: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System - (Sec. 201) Authorizes appropriations for FY 2004 for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund. Title III: General Provisions - Subtitle A: Recurring General Provisions - (Sec. 301) Permits appropriations authorized by this Act for salary, pay, retirement, and other benefits for Federal employees to be increased by such additional or supplemental amounts as may be necessary for increases in such compensation or benefits authorized by law. (Sec. 302) Specifies that the authorization of appropriations by this Act shall not be deemed to constitute authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity which is not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of the United States. Subtitle B: Intelligence - (Sec. 311) Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to authorize the FBI Director to enter into personal services contracts if the services to be provided directly support FBI intelligence or counterintelligence missions. Requires the Contracting Officer of the FBI to ensure that each contract so entered is the appropriate means of securing the services to be provided. Requires annual reports from the FBI Director to specified congressional committees on the use of such authority. (Sec. 312) Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to require the DCI to prepare an independent cost estimate of the full life-cycle cost of development, procurement, and operation of each major system to be acquired by the intelligence community (IC). Qualifies as a major system any IC program for which the aggregate future cost of development or procurement, or combination thereof, will exceed $500 million. Requires such estimate to be updated upon completion of any preliminary design review or after any significant modification or change in circumstances. Requires the DCI to establish an office for preparing such estimates within the Office of the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence for Community Management. Requires: (1) the budget request for an IC major system to match the most recent independent cost estimate for such system; and (2) such estimates to be included in the annual budget justification materials submitted to Congress. (Sec. 313) Repeals a section of the National Security Act of 1947 which terminated, on January 6, 2000, provisions concerning the application of sanctions laws to intelligence activities. (Sec. 314) Amends the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 to increase the threshold amounts for projects for the construction or improvement of a facility used primarily by IC personnel that must be specifically listed in the President's budget and specifically authorized by Congress. Allows vital or urgent projects to be carried out seven (currently 21) days after notification to the intelligence committees. Allows a project to begin on the date the notification is received if the DCI and the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) jointly determine that: (1) an emergency exists with respect to national security or the protection of health, safety, or environmental quality; and (2) any delay in the commencement of the project would harm any or all of those interests. (Sec. 315) Amends the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 to extend until September 1, 2004, the due date of a final report from the National Commission for the Review of the Research and Development Programs of the United States Intelligence Community. (Sec. 316) Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a program to provide appropriate training to officials of State and local government agencies and representatives of private sector entities with responsibilities relating to the oversight and management of first responders, counterterrorism activities, or critical infrastructure. Requires consultation with the Attorney General (AG) to ensure that such training program does not duplicate the training program established under the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. Requires such Secretary to submit an implementation plan to Congress. (Sec. 317) Requires the DCI to carry out pilot programs of the feasibility of: (1) permitting IC analysts to access and analyze intelligence from other IC elements, including NSA signals intelligence; and (2) training students for employment as intelligence analysts in areas in which current capabilities are or are likely to be deficient. Requires the DCI to submit reports assessing each program. (Sec. 319) Requires the DCI to carry out and report to Congress on a three-year pilot project to test and evaluate alternative, innovative methods to promote equality of IC employment opportunities for women, minorities, and individuals with diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds, skills, language proficiency, and expertise. Requires a report form the DCI to Congress on a plan (to be entitled the \"DCI Diversity Plan\") on increasing diversity of IC officers and employees. (Sec. 320) Expresses the sense of Congress that IC elements should endeavor to recruit U.S. citizens and nationals who participated in Operations Enduring Freedom or Iraqi Freedom and in any other campaigns abroad upon their separation, discharge, or release from the armed forces. (Sec. 321) Authorizes the President to establish an External Collections Capabilities and Requirements Review Panel as specified in the classified annex to this Act. Subtitle C: Counterintelligence - (Sec. 341) Requires the DCI to establish and implement: (1) an inspection process intended to assure that all Federal agencies that handle classified information relating to U.S. national security maintain effective operational security practices and programs directed against counterintelligence activities; (2) a process for all elements of the IC to review, on an annual basis, individuals included on distribution lists for access to classified information; and (3) a process by which each head of an IC element directs that all employees of that element, in order to be granted access to classified information, submit financial disclosure forms. Directs the DCI to establish for all IC elements programs and procedures by which sensitive classified information relating to human intelligence is safeguarded against unauthorized disclosure by employees. Requires the AG to establish policies and procedures for assisting in the consideration of intelligence and national security-related equities in the development of charging documents and related pleadings in espionage prosecutions. Subtitle D: Reports - (Sec. 351) Requires the DCI and the Secretary to jointly report to specified congressional committees on national security risks of current computer security practices within elements of the IC and DOD. (Sec. 352) Requires the DCI, Secretary, AG, Director of the Office of Personnel Management, and the heads of other appropriate Federal departments and agencies as determined by the President to report to the intelligence and defense committees on the utility and effectiveness of current Federal security background investigations and security clearance procedure . (Sec. 353) Requires the DCI to report to the intelligence, defense, governmental affairs, and judiciary committees on means of improving the detail or transfer of civilian intelligence personnel between and among various IC elements in order to enhance the flexibility and effectiveness of the IC in responding to changes in requirements for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of intelligence. (Sec. 354) Requires the President to report to the intelligence, defense, governmental affairs, and judiciary committees on current policy and regulation impediments to the sharing of classified information across and among Federal departments and agencies, and between Federal departments and agencies and agencies of State and local government and the private sector, for national security purposes, including homeland security. (Sec. 355) Directs the Secretary and DCI to report jointly to the defense and intelligence committees on IC strategic and budgetary planning.
