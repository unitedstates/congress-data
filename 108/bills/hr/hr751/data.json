Makes such a violation not resulting in death a Class B misdemeanor.Directs that any moneys received by the United States from such a fine be used to: (1) cover administrative, legal, and related expenses; (2) cover the costs of any improvement, protection, or rehabilitation work on public lands; and (3) increase public awareness of regulations and other requirements regarding recreational use of vehicles on public lands.Amends Federal law to set forth similar provisions regarding vehicle violations in National Forest lands."
