    "text": "United States International Leadership Act of 2003 - Directs the President, acting through the Secretary of State and the relevant U.S. chiefs of mission, to seek to establish a democracy caucus at the United Nations (UN), the UN Human Rights Commission, the UN Conference on Disarmament, and at other broad-based international organizations. Urges such a caucus to: (1) forge common positions on matters of concern before the organization; (2) work to revise the system of regional voting and decision making; and (3) set up a rotational leadership scheme to provide member states an opportunity to serve as the designated president of the caucus. Requires the Secretary, acting through the principal officers responsible for advising the Secretary on international organizations, to ensure that a high-level delegation from the U.S. Government is sent annually to consult with key foreign governments in every region to promote the U.S. agenda at key international fora, such as the UN General Assembly, UN Human Rights Commission, the UN Education, Science, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the International Whaling Commission. Directs the President, acting through the Secretary and the relevant U.S. chiefs of mission, to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States to: (1) reform the criteria for leadership and, in appropriate cases for membership, at all UN bodies and at other international organizations and multilateral institutions so as to exclude nations that violate the principles of the specific organization; (2) make it a policy of the UN and other international organizations and multilateral institutions that a member state may not stand in nomination or be in rotation for a leadership position if it is subject to UN Security Council sanctions; and (3) work to ensure that no member state stand in nomination or be in rotation for a leadership position if it is subject to a specified determination under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the Arms Export Control Act, or the Export Administration Act. Amends the Foreign Service Act to direct the Secretary to establish a series of training courses for Foreign Service officers, including appropriate chiefs of mission, on the conduct of diplomacy at international organizations and other multilateral institutions and at broad-based multilateral negotiations of international instruments. Requires the Secretary to ensure that civil service employees of the Department of State assigned to certain positions under the Foreign Service Act (as amended by this Act) have the proper training. Declares that the precepts for selection boards responsible for recommending promotions into and within the Senior Foreign Service shall consider whether the Service member has served in a position whose primary responsibility is to formulate policy towards or represent the United States at an international organization, a multilateral institution, or a broad-based multilateral negotiation of an international instrument. Directs the Secretary to report to the appropriate congressional committees on: (1) whether a new cone should be established for the Foreign Service that concentrates on Service members that serve at international organizations and multilateral institutions or are primarily responsible for participation in broad-based multilateral negotiations of international instruments; and (2) alternative mechanisms for achieving the objective of developing a core group of U.S. diplomats and other government employees who have expertise and broad experience in conducting multilateral diplomacy. Authorizes the Secretary to establish, within the Bureau of International Organizational Affairs, an Office on Multilateral Negotiations to be headed by a Special Representative for Multilateral Negotiations with the rank of Ambassador-at-Large, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Requires the President to submit to the appropriate congressional committees a plan to synchronize the payment of U.S. assessments to the UN and other international organizations over a multiyear period so that the United States can resume paying its dues to such international organizations at the beginning of each calendar year."
