    "text": "Education for All Act of 2004 - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to establish as a policy priority of the United States the achievement of universal education by working with foreign countries and international organizations to: (1) assist developing countries committed to serious reforms in providing all children with quality elementary and secondary education; and (2) provide incentives to encourage educational system reform and educational service improvement in countries lacking such commitment. Requires the President to establish an Education for All Task Force to carry out such policy and to develop a unified strategy to promote universal basic education. Authorizes the President to provide funds or other assistance to eligible entities to assist a foreign country in developing and implementing a comprehensive national education plan that allows its citizens to access and complete basic education. Sets forth requirements for such plans. Authorizes the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to establish an education fellowship program at USAID to increase the expertise of agency personnel in promoting universal basic education and to carry out this Act."
