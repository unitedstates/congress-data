Authorizes appropriations for grants to the Governments of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palua, Guam, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa for establishing or continuing programs for the control and prevention of communicable diseases, including cholera and Hansen's Disease.

Requires the United States to make available to the Governments of such States and Republics necessary sums for the payment of obligations incurred for the use of such facilities."
