Requires such an association to establish and maintain: (1) a system for collecting and retaining registration information, including disciplinary actions, on its members and their associated persons; and (2) a readily accessible electronic or other process (in addition to the currently required toll-free telephone listing) to receive and promptly respond to inquiries pertaining to such information, including registration information that has been reported to the association by any registered national securities exchange involving its members and their associated persons.Shields such association from liability for actions taken or omitted to implement this Act.Amends the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to shield from liability for actions taken or omitted by any entity designated by the Securities Exchange Commission as the entity through which an investment adviser may be required to file any required fee, application, report, or notice."
