    "text": "National Sex Offender Registry Act of 2004 - Directs the Attorney General to establish a national sex offender registry that: (1) makes publicly available, via the Internet, information about sexually violent predators and persons convicted of a sexually violent offense or a criminal offense against a minor; and (2) allows users to determine which registered sex offenders are currently residing within a specified area. Requires States and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to submit to the Attorney General specified information regarding convicted persons who are required to register with a sexual offender registration program, including: (1) that person's name, address, date of birth, physical description, and photograph; (2) the nature and date of commission of the offense; and (3) the date on which that individual is released from prison or placed on parole, supervised release, or probation. Requires: (1) any State that provides for a civil commitment proceeding to notify the State attorney general of any impending release of a sexually violent predator or of anyone who has been deemed by the State to be at high-risk for recommitting specified sexual or violent offenses; (2) the State attorney general to consider whether or not to institute a civil commitment proceeding; and (3) each State to intensively monitor, for at least a year, any such person who has been unconditionally released by the State and who has not been civilly committed. Makes a State that fails to submit the required information or to implement Act requirements ineligible to receive 25 percent of funds that would otherwise be allocated to it under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994."
