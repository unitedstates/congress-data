(Makes such provision applicable to local governments under similar outpatient drug purchase arrangements.) Applies such requirement to direct purchases by State or local organizations or agents. Sets forth enforcement provisions, including manufacturer debarment for repeat violations. Permits a State, with respect to its provision of Medicaid assistance for covered outpatient drugs, to: (1) continue its Medicaid rebate agreement; or (2) disregard the manufacturer's average foreign price in determining the best price under a rebate agreement. Defines specified terms."
