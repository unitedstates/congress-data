Sets limitations on the Federal share of the costs of activities carried out with such grants. Mandates that an applicant be a unit of municipal or county government or a consortium of such units in order to be eligible for a grant under this Act. Provides that grant amounts: (1) shall be used only for the category of use for which the grant is made; (2) may be used only for new domestic preparedness initiatives; (3) shall not be used to sustain or supplement an existing program; and (4) may be distributed to fire departments, police departments, emergency services, and public health agencies of the grantee."
