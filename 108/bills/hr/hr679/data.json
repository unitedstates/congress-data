    "text": "Late Term Abortion Ban Act of 2003 - Prohibits intentionally and knowingly performing an abortion of a viable unborn child during the third trimester of pregnancy, except where the person performing the abortion is a physician who concludes in good faith that the abortion is necessary to prevent the death or a substantial risk of serious impairment to the physical or mental health of the woman. Requires a physician who performs such an abortion to certify to the designated State agency the medical indications supporting the physician's judgement.Requires each State to enact legislation to assure that its licensing body may take appropriate disciplinary action against a physician who violates this Act, including authority to refuse to admit to examination or to issue a license or license renewal to a violator of this Act."
