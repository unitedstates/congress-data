Directs that priority be provided to those municipalities documented by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to possess a serial killer.Authorizes appropriations for FY 2004 through 2008 for grants to States that are documented by the FBI to possess a serial killer, to eliminate the backlog in carrying out DNA analyses of specified samples. Directs that grant applications include each offense under State law for which a sentence of death or imprisonment at hard labor may be imposed. Authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to States documented to possess a serial killer to be used by the State to promote and develop self-defense classes, with not less than 15 percent of the grant amount used for firearms training.Requires the Director of the FBI to establish a Serial Killer Program within its General Criminal Investigative Division."
