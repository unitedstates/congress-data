    "text": "Amends the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 to prescribe guidelines under which cost sharing limitations applicable to grants and loans to farmers, ranchers, and rural small businesses for renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements shall not apply to loan guarantees extended to specified projects if the loan will be used to: (1) purchase a renewable energy system associated with a commercial production agricultural enterprise; and (2) promote a solution to an environmental problem of the State in which the project will be implemented. Limits the principal amount of an eligible loan to between $50 million and $100 million. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture, when making loan guarantees for such projects, to give priority to renewable energy projects that promote the production of an agricultural commodity that is imported into the United States."
