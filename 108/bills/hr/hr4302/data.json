(Sec. 4) Authorizes Superior Court extension for up to 21 days, under certain conditions, of the period for which an individual may be detained for emergency observation and diagnosis in a facility, hospital, or mental health provider. (Sec. 5) Authorizes the Commission to grant a continuance of up to 14 days beyond the current allowed recess of five days for the counsel of persons alleged to be mentally ill to prepare a case. Requires extension of the emergency observation and detention period for the subject of the hearing for the duration of the continuance. (Sec. 6) Revises procedures on hearings and determination of mental illness. Limits to the least restrictive alternative the kind of facility to which a Court may order a person's commitment, consistent with the best interests of the person and the public. (Sec. 7) Authorizes a one-year renewal of commitment status by the Commission, subject to judicial review, of a person in a facility, hospital, or mental health provider."
