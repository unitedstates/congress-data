    "text": "Long Island Sound Stewardship Act of 2004 - Establishes the Long Island Sound Stewardship Initiative Region in Connecticut and New York. Establishes the Long Island Sound Stewardship Advisory Committee to: (1) evaluate applications from government or nonprofit organizations qualified to hold conservation easements for funds to purchase land or development rights for designated stewardship sites; (2) evaluate applications to develop and implement management plans to address threats; (3) evaluate applications to act on opportunities to protect and enhance stewardship sites; (4) recommend that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency award grants to qualified applicants; (5) recommend guidelines for evaluating information to identify stewardship sites; (6) publish a list of sites that further the purposes of this Act; (7) raise awareness of the values of and threats to these sites; and (8) leverage additional resources for improved stewardship of the Region. Requires the Committee to submit annual reports to the Administrator. Protects the existing legal rights of private property owners. States that nothing in this Act requires private property owners located within the Region to participate in the Initiative. Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to reauthorize appropriations for the Office of Management Conference of the Long Island Sound Study and implementation of the Long Island Sound Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan through FY 2009."
