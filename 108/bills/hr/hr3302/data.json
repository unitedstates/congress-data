Requires the Secretary to report annually to each House of Congress on the amounts and dates of deposits into the Account and on the public debt redeemed during the previous year. Amends the Rules of the House of Representatives to provide that it shall be in order, during the reading of an appropriation bill for amendment in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, to consider en bloc amendments proposing only to reduce appropriations among objects in the bill and to appropriate an amount not greater than the amount so reduced to the Account."
