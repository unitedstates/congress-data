Urges the President to continue to pursue similar efforts to assure the destruction of excess, obsolete, and illicit stocks of MANPADS worldwide. Urges the President to enter into agreements with the governments of foreign countries that, at a minimum, would prohibit: (1) the entry into force of a MANPADS manufacturing license agreement and MANPADS co-production agreement (other than a manufacturing license or co-production agreement with a country party to such an agreement); (2) the export of a MANPADS, including any component, part, accessory, or attachment thereof, without an individual validated license, except pursuant to transfers between governments; and (3) the re-export or retransfer of a MANPADS (or any component, part, accessory, or attachment) to a third person, organization, or government unless the written consent of the government that approved the original export or transfer is first obtained. Directs the President to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the status of such diplomatic efforts and of efforts by the appropriate U.S. agencies to comply with the recommendations of the General Accounting Office report GAO-04-519, entitled \"Non-proliferation: Further Improvements Needed in U.S. Efforts to Counter Threats from MANPADS.\" (Sec. 4) Directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as soon as practicable, but not later than, the completion date of Phase II of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) counter-MANPADS development and demonstration program, to establish a process for conducting airworthiness and safety certification of missile defense systems used to defend commercial aircraft against MANPADS. Directs the FAA, not later than 90 days after the first airworthiness and safety certification for a missile defense system for commercial aircraft is issued by the Administrator, and annually thereafter until December 31, 2008, to report to specified congressional committees on each airworthiness and safety certification issued for such defense system for a commercial aircraft. (Sec. 5) Urges the President to pursue strong programs to reduce the number of MANPADS worldwide. Directs the President to report to the appropriate congressional committees on the status of such programs. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to report to specified congressional committees on DHS plans to secure airports and the aircraft arriving and departing from airports against MANPADS attacks."
