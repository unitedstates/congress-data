The summary of that version is repeated here.)Expresses the appreciation of the House of Representatives for the efforts of the United Nations Secretary General to seek a peaceful, just, and lasting settlement of the Cyprus problem for the benefit of the people of Cyprus and the region.Expresses its strong disappointment that the Secretary General's efforts to bring his plan for a comprehensive settlement to a referenda by the people of Cyprus has been rejected.Expresses its very strong regret that Turkish Cypriot leader, Mr. Denktash, rejected the comprehensive settlement offered by the Secretary General and denied the Turkish Cypriot people the opportunity to determine their own future by refusing to offer the settlement proposal to referenda.Declares that the House remains committed, despite the recent setback, to giving any assistance necessary for finding a just and durable settlement for the Cyprus problem and urges the maximum effort by the U.S. Government and others to redouble their efforts to seek a just and lasting settlement to the Cyprus problem.Encourages both Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders to renew their efforts to find a settlement to the Cyprus problem on the basis of the Secretary General's framework.Urges the Governments of Turkey and Greece to do everything possible to support the search for a settlement, including actions by the Government of Turkey helping to persuade the Turkish Cypriot leader to reach an agreement which would reunite the island and which would serve the interests of both Cypriot communities.Encourages both sides, upon completion of a comprehensive settlement, to consider putting it to referenda, if necessary, in order that the will of the people of Cyprus can be democratically expressed."
