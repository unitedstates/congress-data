    "text": "Reiterates the condemnation of the House of Representatives of the attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on July 18, 1994, and honors its victims. Urges the Government of Argentina to fulfill its international obligations and its promise to the Argentine people by pursuing the local and international connections to this act of terrorism, wherever it may lead, and to properly punish all those involved. Welcomes Argentine President Nestor Kirchner's political will to pursue the investigation of the bombing of the AMIA to its ultimate conclusions. Calls on the President of the United States to: (1) raise this issue in bilateral discussions with Argentine officials; and (2) underscore the U.S. concern regarding the past delay in the resolution of this case. Recommends that the President of the United States create more mechanisms for intra-regional information sharing and, where needed, joint counter-terrorism operations. Encourages the President of the United States to provide democratic governments in South America and Central America with the necessary financial resources as well as equipment and training for intelligence and security forces. Recommends that the U.S. Representative to the Organization of American States seek support from the countries composing the Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism to assist, if needed, in the investigation of this terrorist attack. Calls on all governments in the Western Hemisphere to pursue an anti-terrorism campaign based on unity of purpose, dedication of resources, constant vigilance, and cooperation. Calls on the Islamic Republic of Iran to: (1) respond favorably to the Argentine arrest warrant for five Iranian citizens believed to be responsible for the 1994 attack on the AMIA; and (2) cease any and all assistance to terrorist organizations, and renounce any and all involvement with terrorism."
