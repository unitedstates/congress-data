Declares that the alleged crimes of a handful of individuals should not detract from the commendable sacrifices of over 300,000 members of the U.S. armed forces who have served, or are serving, in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Reaffirms the American principle that any and all individuals under U.S. custody and care shall be afforded proper and humane treatment. Urges the Secretary of the Army: (1) to conduct a full and thorough investigation into any and all allegations of mistreatment or abuse of detainees in Iraq; (2) and appropriate military authorities to undertake corrective action to address command and systemic deficiencies identified in the incidents in question; and (3) to bring swift justice to any member of the Armed Forces who violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Reaffirms the need for Congress to be frequently updated on the status of efforts by the Department of Defense to address and resolve such issues. Expresses: (1) deep appreciation to the members of the Armed Forces who have selflessly served, or are so serving, in Operation Iraqi Freedom; (2) the support and thanks of the Nation to the families and friends of such members; and (3) the continuing solidarity and support of the House of Representatives and the American people for the partnership of the United States with the Iraqi people in building a viable Iraqi government and a secure nation."
