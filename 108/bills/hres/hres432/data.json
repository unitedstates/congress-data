Urges U.S. representatives at the UN to call upon all parties to armed conflict to protect women and girls from gender-based violence. Requests the Secretary of State to study and report to Congress on the impact of armed conflict on women and girls, the role of women in peace-building, the gender dimensions of peace processes and conflict resolution, and progress on gender mainstreaming throughout peacekeeping missions."
