Supports the American Library Association's fight to equip libraries with up-to-date technology. Urges members of both parties to support dramatic increases in funding for libraries. Declares that: (1) libraries have an expanding role in providing information relating to prosperity, civic competence, homeland security, and peace; and (2) those who work in libraries should be compensated at a level comparable to their important role in the functioning of democracy."
