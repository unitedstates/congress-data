    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Provides that if the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States, in a seven-year period, adopt and submit to the Clerk of the Supreme Court an identical amendment to the Constitution related to but one subject, that amendment shall be valid as a part of the Constitution, without any action being required by the Congress. Provides that: (1) each State shall retain the power to rescind its amendment until the earlier of expiration of the seven-year period or the date of receipt of the identical amendment from three-fourths of the several States; and (2) no State shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate without its consent. Requires the Supreme Court to rule whether the amendment is related to one subject only within 60 days after receiving the amendment from ten States. Provides that if the Court fails to rule on the issue within such period, the amendment shall be conclusively presumed to meet the-one subject standard. Invalidates the amendment if the Court rules that it fails to meet such standard."
