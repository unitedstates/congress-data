Makes any person who has been elected for a full term: (1) two times to the Senate ineligible for election or appointment to the Senate; or (2) three times to the House ineligible for election or appointment to the House. Bars any person who has served as a: (1) Senator for more than three years of a term from being subsequently eligible for election to the Senate more than once; and (2) Representative for more than two years from being subsequently eligible for election to the House more than twice. Excludes election or service occurring before this article becomes operative when determining eligibility. Prohibits any Member of one House of the Congress (except in the final year of the Member's current term) from qualifying under State law as a candidate for the other House unless the Member has resigned from the House in which he or she currently serves. Applies this article to terms of office after the first day of the year immediately following the first presidential election after ratification of this article."
