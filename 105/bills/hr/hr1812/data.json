Directs the Secretary to submit to the Congress a strategic plan with legislative recommendations for carrying out such elimination and block grant program. Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office to submit to a specified congressional committee recommendations for minimizing the cost of Federal education programs through the elimination of the Department. Directs the Comptroller General to report to such congressional committee with recommendations for the most efficient means of achieving the complete elimination of the Department and the transfer of appropriate functions to other existing or successor Federal or State agencies."
