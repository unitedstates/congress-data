    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1998-07-31", 
    "text": "Empowering Parents to Fight Drugs Act of 1998 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to State educational agencies (SEAs) to enable each local educational agency (LEA) to develop and implement a random drug testing program for students in grades seven through 12. Sets forth requirements for State and local allocations and administrative costs. Requires LEAs receiving grants to make certain certifications to SEAs. Sets forth required and optional uses of grant funds. Requires LEAs receiving such grant funds to inform parents about: (1) the random drug testing program, in detail; (2) their right to withdraw their child from such program; and (3) any positive results of a drug test of their child. Requires such LEAs to provide for confidentiality of drug test results. Requires a medical review officer provided by the LEA to: (1) receive all test results; (2) inform only the student's parents after a first positive result, and attempt to meet with them to discuss the results and available community rehabilitation and education resources and services; and (3) after two or more positive results, inform parents and school officials who shall determine appropriate action for the student based on school policy. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Elementary and Secondary Act of 1965 (ESEA) to require any LEA that receives ESEA funds to implement a drug testing program that meets the requirements of this Act."
