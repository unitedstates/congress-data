    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1998-05-19", 
    "text": "Nigerian Democracy and Civil Society Empowerment Act - Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the President should, in any and all international fora, actively seek the cooperation of other countries as part of the U.S. policy of isolating the military government of Nigeria; (2) the President should instruct the U.S. Representative to the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) to use the U.S. vote at the UNHRC annual meeting to condemn human rights abuses in Nigeria, and to press for the appointment of a special rapporteur on Nigeria; and (3) the President should not send any other envoy, besides the U.S. Ambassador, to Nigeria without prior notification of the Congress and should not designate a special envoy to Nigeria without consulting the Congress. (Sec. 4) Earmarks specified development assistance funds for FY 1999 through 2001 to: (1) nongovernmental organizations to promote democracy, good governance, and the rule of law in Nigeria; (2) the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) to provide grants to support individuals or nongovernmental organizations that seek to promote, directly or indirectly, the advancement of human rights there; and (3) the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) to support its activities in Nigeria, including the promotion of greater awareness among Nigerians of constitutional democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Administrator of AID should: (1) increase the number of U.S. personnel at its office in Lagos, Nigeria, from within its current, overall staff resources; and (2) consider placement of personnel elsewhere in Nigeria. (Sec. 5) Prohibits economic and military assistance or arms transfers to the Government of Nigeria. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. executive directors of specified international financial institutions to use the U.S. vote to oppose any multilateral assistance to the Government of Nigeria. (Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary of State to deny a visa to, and the Attorney General shall exclude from the United States, certain Nigerian nationals. (Sec. 7) Declares that, unless a free and fair presidential election has occurred in Nigeria during 1998, the President shall: (1) prohibit, under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, any financial transaction involving the participation by a Nigerian national as a representative of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in a sporting event in the United States; (2) prohibit entry into the United States of any employees or military officers of the Nigerian government and their immediate families; (3) list by name to the appropriate congressional committees any senior Nigerian government officials and military officers who are suspended from entry into the United States; and (4) consider additional economic sanctions against Nigeria. Expresses the sense of the Congress that any international sports organization in which the United States is represented should refuse to invite the participation of any Nigerian national in any sporting event in the United States sponsored by that organization. (Sec. 8) Authorizes the President to waive any prohibition contained in this Act, provided the President makes a certain determination, and notifies the Congress, regarding Nigeria's human rights record and progress toward democracy. (Sec. 9) Prohibits any U.S. department or agency from providing any assistance or other contribution to any political party, group, organization, or person if it would have the purpose or effect of supporting or influencing any election or campaign for election in Nigeria. Authorizes the President to waive such prohibition if: (1) the climate exists in Nigeria for a free and fair democratic election that will lead to civilian rule; or (2) it is in the U.S. national interests to do so. (Sec. 10) Directs the Secretary of State to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees on governmental corruption in Nigeria."
