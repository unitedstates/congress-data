(Sec. 15) Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1996 to permit studies undertaken by the Secretary concerning the Pacific region to include flood damage reduction and environmental restoration. (Sec. 16) Establishes the Water Resources Foundation, a nonprofit District of Columbia corporation, to: (1) encourage, accept, and administer gifts of money and property for Corps activities and services in managing natural resources at Army water resources development projects; and (2) undertake and conduct other activities to further the conservation and management of natural, scenic, historic, and recreational resources at such projects. Provides, with respect to the Foundation, for: (1) conflict of interest prohibitions; (2) tax-exempt status; (3) a Board of Directors; (4) corporate powers and obligations; and (5) an authorization of appropriations for FY 1999 through 2001. (Sec. 17) Directs the Secretary to establish and collect fees from applicants for the evaluation of commercial permit applications, the preparation of environmental impact statements in connection with such applications, and the delineation of wetlands for major developments affecting wetlands. Establishes in the Treasury the Army Civil Works Regulatory Program Account for the deposit and expenditure of such fees. (Sec. 18) Authorizes the Secretary to acquire from willing sellers land and property in the vicinity of Pierre, South Dakota, or to floodproof or relocate other property, in order to provide full operational capability for the Missouri River Main Stem dams that are part of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin Program.
