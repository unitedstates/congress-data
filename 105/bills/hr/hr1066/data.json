Requires that any entitlement of an individual to additional points under the preceding in connection with a particular examination shall terminate: (1) upon the termination of the individual's entitlement to welfare benefits or within a reasonable period thereafter as may be provided for under any regulations to carry out this Act; or (2) if later, upon the expiration of the 12-month period beginning on the date of the examination (non-applicable if the welfare benefits are terminated by reason of fraud or for other similar reasons). Directs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to prescribe any regulations necessary to carry out this Act, including provisions relating to: (1) how an individual may demonstrate that he or she qualifies as a welfare recipient for purposes of this Act; and (2) procedures under which OPM, an appointing authority, or another official or agency shall be notified in the event of a termination of welfare benefits."
