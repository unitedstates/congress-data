(Sec. 3) Makes the antitrust laws inapplicable to conduct engaged in between the enactment date of this Act and December 31, 2001, solely for the purpose of establishing responses designed to mitigate the impact of computer date failure in a computer system, with an exception for conduct that results in a boycott."
