    "text": "Family Television Viewing Information and Empowerment Act of 1997 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from granting or renewing a license for a broadcast television station unless the license applicant submits to the FCC evidence of: (1) a plan for the implementation of a rating system for the content of programming to be broadcast by such station, in the case of a license grant application; or (2) the current implementation of such a rating system, in the case of application for license renewal. Prohibits the FCC from assigning transitional digital television frequencies to a broadcast television station unless the person licensed to operate such station submits to the FCC evidence of the implementation of a rating system. Directs the FCC to require a person assigned such frequencies, before the enactment of this Act, to surrender them to the FCC if the person does not submit to it evidence of the implementation of a rating system before using the frequencies. Outlines general and specific rating system elements, requiring FCC review of each such system."
