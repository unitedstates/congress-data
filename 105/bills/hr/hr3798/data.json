    "text": "Telephone Billing Fairness Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to direct the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to require each provider of telephone exchange or toll service and any billing agent for such provider, upon request of a subscriber, to block from inclusion in the subscriber's telephone bill any charges for products or services that are not telephone exchange or toll service. Allows a subscriber to consent to the inclusion of such charges by way of an oral or written request followed by a subsequent confirmation. Directs the FCC to require all providers and their agents to notify their subscribers that they may: (1) obtain blocking of such charges through an oral or written request; and (2) consent to the inclusion of such charges in the manner set forth above. Provides that, for purposes of this Act, telephone toll service does not include commercial mobile services or pay-per-call services."
