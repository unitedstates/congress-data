    "text": "Miccosukee Reserved Area Act - Terminates a Special Use Permit, issued by the Secretary of the Interior to the Miccosukee Indian Tribe on February 1, 1973, authorizing such Tribe's use of a specified area of the northern portion of Everglades National Park, Florida. Expands the area covered by the former Permit, to be known as the Miccosukee Reserved Area (MRA). Directs the Tribe to govern its own affairs within the MRA as though it were a Federal Indian reservation. Gives the Tribe exclusive use and occupancy over the MRA in perpetuity. Confers Indian Country status on the MRA, with exclusive Federal jurisdiction. Directs the Tribe to prevent and abate any significant: (1) water quality, quantity, or distribution degradation; (2) propagation of exotic plants or animals outside the MRA; (3) hindrance to public access to Park areas outside the MRA; and (4) cumulative adverse environmental impact on the Park outside the MRA resulting from development or other activities within the MRA. Requires the Tribe to: (1) develop, publish, and implement procedures assuring adequate public notice and opportunity to comment on major tribal actions within the MRA that may have a significant cumulative adverse impact on the Everglades ecosystem; and (2) adopt and comply with water quality standards within the MRA that are at least as protective as those for the Park areas approved under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Restricts buildings within the MRA to 45 feet or two stories in height, with exceptions for: (1) a structure within the Miccosukee Government Center; and (2) certain public service structures. Authorizes the waiver of such restriction by the Secretary when appropriate. Provides other limitations, including gaming and aviation, within the MRA. Directs the Secretary and the tribal chairman to reach required agreements under this Act, authorizing the use of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. Provides general authorities, including easements and access rights to Federal agents to monitor tribal compliance with this Act. States that nothing in this Act shall enhance or diminish current water rights. Authorizes the Attorney General or the Tribe to bring suit to enforce this Act."
