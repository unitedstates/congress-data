    "date": "1997-09-03", 
    "text": "Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to allow a State or local government to enforce regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that prohibit: (1) a use of citizens band radio equipment not authorized by the FCC; or (2) the unauthorized operation of citizens band radio equipment on a frequency between 24 and 35 megahertz. Provides that possession of a station license issued by the FCC in any radio service for the operation at issue shall preclude action by a State or local government. Requires the FCC to provide technical guidance to State and local governments regarding the detection and determination of violations of such regulations. Permits a person affected to submit to the FCC an appeal of the decision of a State or local government enforcing a regulation on the grounds that such entity acted outside the authority provided in this Act."
