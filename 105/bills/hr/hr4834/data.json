    "text": "Northwest Salmon Recovery Act of 1998 - Instructs the Secretary of the Interior to develop a unified plan for salmon recovery in the Pacific Northwest region whose goal is to restore sustainable naturally reproducing salmon populations to support tribal and nontribal harvest, cultural, and economic practices. (Sec. 4) Requires such plan to address: (1) treaty, trust, and Endangered Species Act responsibilities; (2) specified statutory requirements governing fish mitigation and enhancement; (3) water quality standards under the Clean Water Act; and (4) the United States-Canada Pacific Salmon Treaty commitments. (Sec. 5) Directs the Secretaries of Energy and of the Treasury to establish an accounting system for the Bonneville Power Administration that meets prescribed criteria. Directs the Secretaries of the Interior, Energy, Commerce, and the Army to implement a specified Memorandum of Agreement and Annex adopted in 1996, including procedures for effective regional involvement and accountability in the expenditure of moneys from the Administration's fund. Prescribes administrative procedures applicable to such Memorandum of Agreement and to the unified plan. Repeals the mandate to the Northwest Planning Council to appoint an Independent Scientific Review Panel. (Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a Natural Resources Recovery Fund for fish and wildlife restoration in the Pacific Northwest region, and for conservation and renewable energy projects. Directs the Administrator to assess specified fees and charges to ensure that the repayment costs of Washington Public Power Supply System debt is repaid and allocated to all Administration customers. Provides that such fees and charges shall be in addition to: (1) rates for power sales by the Administration; and (2) Administration transmission rates. (Sec. 7) Requires that all rates and charges received for the sale of electric energy by the Administration to its electric energy customers recover all federally incurred costs for electric energy generation and marketing, including meeting certain statutory responsibilities. (Sec. 8) Places the transmission of electric energy by the Administration within the purview of the Federal Power Act, and grants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission jurisdiction over transmission rates, terms, and conditions. Requires rates charged by the Administration for electric energy transmission to be sufficient to recover all costs for compliance with specified statutory responsibilities. Prescribes procedures for cost recovery adjustments by the Administration."
