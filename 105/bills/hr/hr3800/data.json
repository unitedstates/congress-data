Directs the President to ensure that: (1) such purchases, and the ports of departure for those goods, are distributed equitably throughout the United States; and (2) U.S. goods are available at fair prices. Requires that the Comptroller General have access to records and personnel necessary to carry out monitoring and auditing. Authorizes the President to waive the requirements of this Act on a case-by-case basis to the extent that it is important to U.S. national interests."
