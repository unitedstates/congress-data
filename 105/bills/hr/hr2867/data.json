    "text": "Silk Road Strategy Act of 1997 - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize specified assistance, including humanitarian, economic, migration and refugee, development, security, and technical assistance to the South Caucasus and Central Asia countries to: (1) promote sovereignty and independence with democratic government; (2) assist in the resolution of regional conflicts; (3) promote economic cooperation and market-oriented principles; (4) assist in the development of infrastructure necessary for communications, transportation, and energy and trade on an East-West axis in order to build strong relations and commerce between those countries and the democratic, market-oriented countries of the Euro-Atlantic community; and (5) support U.S. business interests and investments in the region. Prohibits assistance to such countries (unless it is important to the U.S. national interest) if the President determines and certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that they: (1) are engaged in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights; (2) have knowingly transferred controlled missiles or missile technology to another country, or any equipment or technology that would contribute to the ability of such country to manufacture weapons of mass destruction (including nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons); (3) have supported acts of international terrorism; (4) are prohibited from receiving such assistance by specified Acts; or (5) have initiated an act of aggression against another state in the region. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should use all diplomatic means to press for an equitable, fair, and permanent resolution to the conflicts in Georgia, Azerbaijan, and the civil war in Tajikistan."
