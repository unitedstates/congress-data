Specifies as being excluded from the definition of \"financial transaction\" for purposes of such prohibition any transaction ordinarily incident to: (1) routine diplomatic relations among countries; (2) an official act by a representative of, or an act authorized by and conducted on behalf of, the U.S. Government; (3) the broadcasting or reporting of news by organizations regularly engaged in such activity; (4) the provision or purchase of assistance intended to relieve human suffering, including medical services, supplies, and equipment; (5) the receipt of emergency medical services; (6) any postal, telegraphic, or other personal communication which does not involve a transfer of anything of value; (7) the protection of intellectual property rights of any U.S. person; (8) the performance of any contract or agreement that was entered into before June 12, 1997 (but not those renewed after such date); (9) the provision of hospitality or transportation services; or (10) the payment of a claim to any U.S. person. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to issue an annual report to the Congress on: (1) the impact of this prohibition on U.S. businesses; and (2) any means by which a negative impact might be ameliorated."
