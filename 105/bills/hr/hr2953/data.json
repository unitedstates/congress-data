Requires the covered facility to report to such registry documented findings of patient abuse by a nurse or home health aide. Imposes civil penalties upon covered facilities that violate such requirements. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish methods by which State nurse and home health registries can pool and share criminal background check summaries and documented findings of patient abuse (national registry coordination system). Requires each State to expand its Medicare and Medicaid nurse aide registry in order to carry out such background checks and other related functions, including reporting of summary information to the national registry coordination system. Sets forth procedures for criminal and abusive work history background checks. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a patient abuse prevention and training demonstration project; and (2) report to the Congress recommendations on whether minimum nurse and home health aide personnel-to-patient levels should be required to avoid patient abuse and, if so, the levels for different types of covered facilities. Authorizes appropriations."
