Prohibits monetary payments or rebates to encourage an individual to accept less than the minimum protections available under this Act. Amends the Public Health Service Act to apply the requirements of this Act to issuers in the individual market. Amends titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require health maintenance organizations, competitive medical plans, State Medicaid plans, issuers of Medicare supplemental policies, and Medicare select policies to meet the requirements of this Act. Amends Federal law relating to health benefits for Federal employees to require compliance with this Act."
