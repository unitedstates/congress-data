    "text": "Metropolitan Airport Noise Reduction Act - Amends Federal transportation law to define \"nonmetropolitan airport\" to mean an airport serving an area with a population of less than one million individuals. Applies the program for the review of airport noise and access restrictions to nonmetropolitan airports only. Requires the application for a waiver of compliance with Stage 3 noise levels to contain assurances that operations of aircraft which do not so comply will not be concentrated at one or more airports. Prohibits an airport noise or access restriction on the operation of Stage 2 or Stage 3 aircraft to or from a metropolitan or nonmetropolitan airport in effect on November 5, 1990, from being modified, superseded, or repealed to make such restriction less stringent."
