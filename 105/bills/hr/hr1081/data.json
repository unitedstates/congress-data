Requires each operator of a radio or television broadcasting station or cable system, at such times and in such manner as the Federal Election Commission shall prescribe by regulation, to report to the Commission the identity of each advertiser, the cost, the duration, and other appropriate information with respect to each Federal political advertisement carried by the station or system."
