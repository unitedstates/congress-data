    "text": "Dual-Use Debit Cardholder Protection Act of 1997 - Amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to provide that if an unauthorized electronic fund transfer has been initiated with a card that does not require the use of a unique identifier (such as a fingerprint or retina scan), consumer liability will be determined as if the transfer were an extension of credit. Declares that a signature shall not be treated as a unique identifier for purposes of this Act. Denies consumer liability for unauthorized electronic fund transfers unless the consumer has received notice of liability for such transfers, and of the advisability of prompt reporting of any loss, theft, or unauthorized use of a card, code, or other means of access. Permits distribution to consumers of electronic fund transfer cards without unique identifiers only if certain validation requirements are met."
