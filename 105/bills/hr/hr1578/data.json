Authorizes the Administrator to provide technical assistance and assistance grants to nonprofit private organizations and individuals, State and local governments, colleges and universities, and interstate agencies to carry out the Program. Provides the Federal and non-Federal share of various Program costs. Provides for Chesapeake Bay Agreement (an agreement among signatory members to restore and protect the Bay's ecosystem) implementation grants, with specified Federal and non-Federal shares. Requires any Federal agency that owns or operates a facility within the Bay watershed to participate in regional and subwatershed planning and restoration programs. Requires the Administrator to ensure that management plans are developed and that implementation is begun by signatories to the Agreement for the Bay tributaries to achieve specified water nutrient and quality goals and habitat restoration and protection. Authorizes the Administrator to offer technical assistance and assistance grants for a small watershed grants program within the Bay. Directs the Administrator to study and report to the Congress on Program goals, effects, and needs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1998 through 2003."
