(Defines \"harass\" to mean persistently physically following or chasing a victim in circumstances where the victim has a reasonable expectation of privacy and has taken reasonable steps to insure that privacy, for the purpose of capturing by a camera or sound recording instrument of any type a visual image, sound recording, or other physical impression of the victim for profit in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce.) Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) limitations on defenses; (2) establishment of a civil cause of action; (3) the lawful use of images; (4) a limitation that only a person physically present may be subject to a criminal charge or civil liability under this Act; and (5) a law enforcement exemption."
