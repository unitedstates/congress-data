Requires the State to: (1) provide the adult relative caregiver for a child with notice of, and an opportunity to be heard in, any dispositional hearing or administrative review held with respect to the child; and (2) give preference to that relative caregiver over a non-related caregiver when determining a placement for a child, provided that the relative caregiver meets all relevant State child protection standards, and that placement with the relative caregiver would be consistent with the child's safety needs."
