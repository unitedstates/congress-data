Authorizes the Secretary of State to commit the United States to pay up to $25 million for distribution under such an agreement. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary of State to reserve a portion of the appropriation for the United States Holocaust Museum for archival research to assist in the restitution of assets looted or extorted from victims of the Holocaust and such other activities that would further Holocaust remembrance and education. Title II: Works of Art - Expresses the sense of the Congress that, consistent with the 1907 Hague Convention, all governments should undertake good faith efforts to facilitate the return of private and public property, such as works of art, to the rightful owners in cases where assets were confiscated from the claimant during the period of Nazi rule and there is reasonable proof that the claimant is the rightful owner."
