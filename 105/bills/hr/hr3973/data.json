    "text": "Trinity River Basin Fish and Wildlife Restoration Reauthorization Act of 1998 - Amends the Trinity River Basin Fish and Wildlife Management Act of 1984 to extend and increase authorized appropriations for the Trinity River Basin fish and wildlife management program. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to ensure that all expenditures of Federal funds for the purposes of the program are made in a manner consistent with such priorities, policies, and technical and fiscal review processes as are established by the Trinity River Basin Fish and Wildlife Task Force. Prohibits amounts expended by a contractor for administrative, indirect, and overhead costs in carrying out a contract of less than $5,000 from exceeding 20 percent of the total amount of Federal funds obligated or expended under the contract. Directs the Secretary to require that any bid or proposal for a contract of $5,000 or more to be funded under the management program, and any such contract, separately identify the amount that is authorized to be expended by a contractor under the contract for such costs. Requires the Task Force, not later than October 1, 2000, and every three years thereafter, to evaluate and report to the Congress on the results of, and improvements required for, the management program; and (2) initiate such changes as may be required in program policies, procedures, and activities to assure that the purposes and requirements of such Act are achieved."
