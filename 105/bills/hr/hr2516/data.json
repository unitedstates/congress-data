Mandates apportionment of such funds among the States according to FY 1997 ISTEA final funding percentages, and distribution to each State according to existing ISTEA categories in the same proportion as FY 1997. Specifies general operating expenses and certain deductions for: (1) territorial highways; (2) the National Recreation Trails program; (3) the Woodrow Wilson Bridge; (4) off-system bridges; (5) Federal lands highways; (6) the highway use tax evasion investigation and enforcement program; (7) the scenic byways program; and (8) ferry boat construction. Limits FY 1998 obligations to 50 percent on October 1, 1997, and 50 percent on July 1, 1998. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to determine the apportionment for which each urbanized area for fixed guideway modernization on a pro rata basis to reflect the partial FY 1998 funding made available by this Act. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend for one year the availability of funds for certain expenditures, and transfers, from the Highway Trust Fund and the Mass Transit Account."
