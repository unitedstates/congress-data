Establishes the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce to: (1) study State and local taxation of transactions using the Internet and Internet access, examine model State legislation relating to the taxation of such transactions, and examine sales and use taxation on remote commerce and related issues; and (2) report to the President and the Congress proposed legislation reflecting its findings. Requires congressional consideration of such proposed legislation within 90 days after its receipt."
