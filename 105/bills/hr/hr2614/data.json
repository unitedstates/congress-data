(Sec. 101) Directs the Secretary of Education to make grants to State educational agencies (SEAs) to make subgrants for local reading improvement programs and tutorial assistance programs. Provides for peer review panel evaluation of SEA grant applications. Requires State establishment of a reading and literacy partnership as a condition for an SEA's receiving such a grant. Limits the portions of such grants which may be used for State administrative costs and for tutorial assistance subgrants. Requires SEAs that receive such grants to make competitive two-year local reading improvement subgrants to local educational agencies (LEAs) with: (1) at least one school that is identified for school improvement; (2) the largest, or second largest, number of children in comparison to all other LEAs in the State; or (3) the highest, or second highest, school-age child poverty rate, in comparison to all other LEAs in the State. Allows subgrantees to train, on a fee-for-service basis, personnel from schools or LEAs that are not subgrant recipients or beneficiaries, in the instructional practices based on scientifically-based reading research used by the recipient. Requires each SEA that receives such a grant to make at least one competitive tutorial assistance subgrant to LEAs with: (1) at least one school located in an empowerment zone or an enterprise community; (2) at least one school identified for school improvement; (3) the largest, or second largest, number of children in comparison to all other LEAs in the State; or (4) the highest, or second highest, school-age child poverty rate, in comparison to all other LEAs in the State. Sets forth authorized uses of such subgrants. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a national assessment of programs under this Act; (2) receive recommendations from the peer review panel in developing the criteria for the assessment; and (3) report on the assessment to the appropriate congressional committees. Requires the National Institute for Literacy to disseminate information on reliable, replicable research on reading and on subgrantee projects that have proven effective. Requires each SEA that receives such a grant to: (1) evaluate subgrantees success; and (2) submit the findings of the evaluations and performance reports to the Secretary, who will submit a summary to the appropriate congressional committees. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1999 and 2000. Title II: Amendments to Even Start Family Literacy Programs - Amends ESEA to direct the Secretary to award competitive grants to States for the planning and implementation of statewide family literacy initiatives, including specified services. (Sec. 203) Requires grant recipients to: (1) provide technical assistance for the evaluation of subgrant recipient local programs; and (2) develop indicators of program quality. (Sec. 205) Directs the Secretary to do research through grant or contract into successful family literacy services to improve the quality of existing programs and to develop models for new programs. Revises provisions for the dissemination of information. Title III: Repeals - Repeals certain unfunded education programs under various Federal laws. (Sec. 301) Repeals the Community School Partnership Act (contained in the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994). Repeals specified provisions of the Educational Research, Development, Dissemination, and Improvement Act of 1994 for a teacher research dissemination demonstration program. Repeals provisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) for: (1) innovative elementary school transition projects; (2) the De Lugo territorial education improvement program; (3) extended time for learning and longer school year; and (4) territorial assistance. Repeals the Family and Community Endeavor Schools Act. Repeals specified provisions of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act for grants for the study, evaluation, and analysis of education systems in other nations.
