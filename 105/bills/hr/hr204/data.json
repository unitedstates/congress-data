    "text": "NAFTA Infrastructure Responsibility Act of 1997 - Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to make grants to Mexican border States and local governments for certain transportation projects necessary to: (1) relieve congestion due to increased traffic resulting from implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); and (2) improve enforcement of motor carrier safety laws. Limits the Federal share of the costs of such projects to 80 percent. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 to authorize the use of appropriations to enter into agreements with Mexican border States that have established infrastructure banks to make lines of credit available to them for projects to construct Federal-aid highways which will support traffic resulting from NAFTA."
