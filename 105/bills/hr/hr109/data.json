Allows employees covered by such Act to take up to four hours during any 30-day period, and up to 24 hours during any 12-month period, of parental involvement and elder care leave to: (1) participate in or attend their children's educational and extracurricular activities; (2) accompany the child to routine medical or dental appointments; and (3) accompany an elderly relative to routine medical or dental appointments or appointments for other professional services related to the elder's care, such as interviewing at nursing or group homes. Amends Federal civil service law to apply the same parental involvement and elder care leave allowance to Federal employees."
