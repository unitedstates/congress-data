Directs the Secretary to meet with State metropolitan planning organizations to discuss the results of the study and the availability of both Federal and State resources for providing ferry services. Amends the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 to make amounts available, out of the Highway Trust Fund (other than the Mass Transit Account), for the construction of ferry boats and ferry terminal facilities. Amends Federal shipping law, with regard to the issuance of a certificate of documentation for a small passenger vessel, passenger vessel, or a ferry, to declare that the members of an association, trust, joint venture, or other entity that owns a vessel that is not registered under the laws of a foreign country or titled in a State do not all have to be U.S. citizens provided the vessel is subject to a charter to a U.S. citizen. Authorizes the Secretary to guarantee loans for ferry operations in the transportation of passengers or passengers and vehicles in the United States and its possessions. Authorizes appropriations."
