    "text": "Computer Security Enhancement Act of 1997 - Amends the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act to require the National Institute of Standards and Technology, in fulfilling its responsibilities under the computer standards program, to: (1) upon request from the private sector, assist in establishing voluntary interoperable standards, guidelines, and associated methods and techniques to facilitate and expedite the establishment of non-Federal public key management infrastructures that can be used to communicate with and conduct transactions with the Federal Government; and (2) provide assistance to Federal agencies in the protection of computer networks, and coordinate Federal response efforts related to unauthorized access to Federal computer systems. Requires the Institute to perform evaluation and tests of: (1) information technologies to assess security vulnerabilities; and (2) commercially available security products for their suitability for use by Federal agencies for protecting sensitive information in computer systems. (Sec. 5) Requires the Institute to carry out specified activities in the development of uniform standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of sensitive information in certain Federal computer systems. (Sec. 6) Directs the Institute to solicit the recommendations of the Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board regarding standards and guidelines that are being considered for submittal to the Secretary of Commerce. Authorizes separate appropriations for FY 1998 and FY 1999 to enable the Board to identify emerging issues related to computer security, privacy, and cryptography and to convene public meetings on those subjects, receive presentations, and publish reports, digests, and summaries for public distribution on those subjects. (Sec. 7) Prohibits the Institute from promulgating, enforcing, or otherwise adopting standards, or carrying out activities or policies, for the Federal establishment of encryption standards required for use in computer systems other than Federal Government computer systems.
