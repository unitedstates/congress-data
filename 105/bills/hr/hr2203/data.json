    "text": "(On June 25, 1998, the Supreme Court ruled that the Line Item Veto Act (Public Law 104-130) is unconstitutional, thus restoring provisions that had been cancelled as summarized below.) (On October 17, 1997, the President exercised the line-item veto to cancel the dollar amounts of discretionary budget authority in connection with the following projects contained in the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1998: (1) dredging of Lake George, Hobart, Indiana; (2) removal of debris and sediment from the channel of Neabsco Creek, Prince William County, Virginia; (3) dredging of Sardis Lake, Mississippi; (4) dredging of Chena River, Fairbanks, Alaska; (5) dredging of Allegheny River, Pennsylvania; (6) In-situ Copper Mining Research Project, Applied Science and Technology Program, Bureau of Reclamation; (7) Department of Energy, Bureau of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy program for a research and development partnership to manufacture electric transmission lines using aluminum matrix composite materials; and (8) Nuclear Regulatory Commission multi-purpose canister licensing.) (Note: The high degree of the items cancelled precluded their inclusion in the original law's summary. As a result, the original law's summary and the summary of the law after the item vetoes are identical. For more information on the specific items vetoed, see the text of the conference report for H.R. 2203, H.Rept. 105-271, and Presidential Cancellation Numbers 97-57 through 97-64.)
