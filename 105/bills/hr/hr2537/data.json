Provides that, in the case of a member to whom a final decree of divorce, dissolution, annulment, or legal separation is issued before the member begins to receive retired pay, the disposable retired pay of such member, for purposes of such monthly payments, shall be computed based on the pay grade and length of service of the member while married. Increases such amount concurrently with retired pay increases. Requires a member's spouse or former spouse to obtain a court order for reapportionment of a member's monthly disposable retired pay by the later of the following dates: (1) two years of the date of the final decree of divorce, dissolution, annulment, or legal separation; or (2) six months after the enactment of this Act. Prohibits the court from treating as part of a member's disposable retired pay amounts which have been waived from such pay in order to receive veterans' disability compensation."
