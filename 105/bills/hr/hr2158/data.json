    "text": "(On June 25, 1998, the Supreme Court ruled that the Line Item Veto Act (Public Law 104-130) is unconstitutional, thus restoring provisions that had been cancelled as summarized below.) (On November 1, 1997, the President exercised his line item veto authority to cancel $14.015 million in discretionary budget authority for the following seven items in this Act: (1) a new national cemetery in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; (2) a police training complex in Arab, Alabama; (3) trade and development activities of the Carter County Chamber of Commerce, Montana; (4) a solar aquatic wastewater treatment demonstration project in Burlington, Vermont; (5) the Alabama Water and Wastewater Institute operator training program; (6) wastewater and drinking water system needs in McConnellsburg, Pennsylvania; and (7) optical astronomy testbeds. The following revised digest summarizes the enacted version of H.R. 2158 as modified by line item veto.) (Note: The high degree of specificity of the items cancelled precluded their inclusion in the original law's summary. As a result, the original law's summary and the summary of the law after the item vetoes are identical. For more information on the specific items vetoed, see the text of the conference report for H.R. 2158, H. Rept. 105-297, and Presidential Cancellation Numbers 97-65 through 97-71.))
