Mandates disclosure to a credit card account holder of the fees and interest rates imposed upon credit advances through the use of third party checks. Proscribes over-the-limit fees in creditor-approved transactions, and two-cycle billing. Prescribes additional notice requirements governing introductory rates to identify the fixed and variable interest rate which will apply following the introductory period."
