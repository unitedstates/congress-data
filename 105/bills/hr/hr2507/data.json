Amends Federal law to instruct the FBI Director to: (1) periodically review standards and procedures in connection with enhanced surveillance equipment at depository institutions; (2) make technical recommendations regarding enhanced surveillance to the Federal banking agencies and the National Credit Union Administration Board; and (3) furnish certain congressional committees with copies of such recommendations.
