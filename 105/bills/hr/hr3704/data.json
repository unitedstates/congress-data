Directs the Secretary to study and report to the Congress on the availability of such information to consumers. Requires the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, to issue a cease and desist order to any air carrier or other party engaged in any practice or policy which constitutes a predatory, unfair, or deceptive practice or unfair method of competition which restricts the widespread, convenient, and efficient access by the public to unbiased comparative air transportation passenger service and fare information or the sale, booking, or distribution of air transportation passenger services or products."
