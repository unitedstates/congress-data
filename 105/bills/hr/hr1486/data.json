Title II: Consolidation of Certain International Affairs Agencies - Chapter 1: General Provisions - International Affairs Agency Consolidation Act of 1997 - Chapter 2: United States International Development Cooperation Agency - Abolishes the United States International Development Cooperation Agency, and transfers all functions of the Director of such agency to the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). (Sec. 221) Provides for: (1) the continuation of USAID as a Federal agency; and (2) the Administrator of USAID to be under the direction of the Secretary of State. Title III: Foreign Assistance Reform - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to revise requirements for the annual report to the Congress on foreign assistance programs. Replaces responsibility for such report from the Chairman of the Development Coordination Committee to the President. (Sec. 301) Directs the President, as part of the annual requests for foreign assistance program authorizations and appropriations, to submit to the Congress annual congressional presentation documents that provide, among other things, the amount, the rationale, and the direct U.S. national interest for the allocation of assistance provided under this Act and the Arms Export Control Act to each foreign country or international organization. Requires the President, as part of such documents, to estimate the year in which each country will no longer receive bilateral development assistance. (Sec. 302) Urges the President for FY 1998 and 1999 to allocate foreign assistance funds to private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives in a manner that reflects the increase in the funding of such entities since FY 1995. (Sec. 303) Replaces the Private Sector Revolving Fund with a program of assistance (including loans, guarantees, and training) to increase the availability of credit to micro- and small enterprises. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 304) Authorizes the Administrator of USAID to provide grant assistance for programs of credit and other assistance for microenterprises in developing countries. Directs the Administrator to establish a monitoring system establishing performance goals for such assistance. (Sec. 305) Authorizes the President to provide funds and support to private sector Enterprise Funds for countries eligible to receive development assistance on the same basis as such funds and support are provided to Enterprise Funds for Poland and Hungary under the Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989. (Sec. 306) Authorizes the President to use certain Development Credit Authority to promote: (1) micro- and small enterprise development; and (2) certain urban and environmental activities. Authorizes appropriations. Requires, to the maximum extent practicable, the use of U.S. technology, firms, and equipment with respect to such activities. (Sec. 307) Withholds from obligation an amount equivalent to 110 percent of the total unpaid fully adjudicated parking fines owed to the District of Columbia, Virginia, Maryland, New York, and New York City by the government of a foreign country in a fiscal year until the Secretary of State certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that such fines are fully paid. (Sec. 308) Withholds U.S. assistance to any foreign country providing economic, development, or security assistance for, or engaging in nonmarket based trade with, the Government of Cuba. Waives such requirements if the President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that the provision of such assistance is important to the national security of the United States. Title IV: Defense and Security Assistance - Chapter 1: Narcotics Control Assistance - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize appropriations for FY 1998 and 1999 for U.S. antinarcotics assistance to foreign countries. (Sec. 403) Directs the President for each major illicit drug producing, major drug-transit, or major money laundering country to do one or more of the following: (1) withhold U.S. bilateral assistance; or (2) instruct the U.S. Executive Director of each multilateral development bank to vote against any loan or other assistance to or for such country. Chapter 2: Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining, and Related Programs - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President to establish the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund to promote bilateral and multilateral nonproliferation and disarmament activities with specified goals.
