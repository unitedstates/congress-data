(Sec. 101) Directs the Secretary of Education to award competitive grants to States for the planning and implementation of statewide family literacy initiatives, including specified services. Requires a State, as a prerequisite to receiving a grant, to form a consortium of State-level programs under ESEA, the Head Start Act, the Adult Education Act, and all other related, State-funded programs. Requires such consortium to create a plan to use a portion of the State's resources to strengthen and expand family literacy services. (Sec. 102) Sets forth definitions of: (1) family literacy services; (2) reading; and (3) reliable, replicable research. (Sec. 103) Requires Even Start program elements to include a dedicated period of time for parents and their children to interact for the specific purpose of enhancing the childrens' development of a relationship of reciprocal learning and teaching. (Sec. 104) Increases from seven to 18 the maximum age for eligibility to participate in Even Start programs. (Sec. 105) Provides for technical assistance for the evaluation of subgrant recipient local programs. (Sec. 106) Requires States receiving such grants to develop indicators of program quality. (Sec. 107) Directs the Secretary to research, through grant or contract, successful family literacy services to improve the quality of existing programs and to develop models for new programs. Requires the National Institute for Literacy to disseminate such research results to States and Even Start subgrant recipients. Title II: Amendments to the Head Start Act - Amends the Head Start Act to reauthorize Head Start programs and to provide for grants and other assistance for family literacy services. (Sec. 201) Revises the definition of family literacy services. Extends through FY 2003 the authorization of appropriations for Head Start program activities. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make available certain amounts for such program activities, transition activities, impact studies, other research and evaluation activities, and family literacy services. Establishes a program of grants and other assistance for family literacy services under the Head Start Act. Directs the Secretary of HHS to make competitive grants for up to 100 Head Start agencies to initiate provision of family literacy services through collaborative partnerships with entities that provide: (1) adult education services; (2) Even Start programs under ESEA; or (3) other services deemed necessary for providing family literacy services. Authorizes the Secretary of HHS to provide: (1) training and technical assistance to Head Start agencies that already provide family literacy services; (2) financial assistance to designated mentor Head Start agencies that demonstrate effective implementation of family literacy services, in order to provide training and technical assistance to other agencies; and (3) grants or other assistance to facilitate training and technical assistance to programs for the development of collaboration agreements with other service providers."
