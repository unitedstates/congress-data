Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Act) to require a State, in submitting a disaster preparedness and prevention program plan prior to receiving assistance under such Act, to set forth a comprehensive and detailed State program for mitigating against emergencies and major disasters, including provisions for prioritizing mitigation measures. (Sec. 103) Authorizes the President to make grants for the costs of the development and application of floodplain mapping technologies that can be used by Federal, State, and local governments and that will likely result in substantial savings over current floodplain mapping methods. (Sec. 104) Authorizes the President to establish a program to provide financial assistance to States and local governments for undertaking predisaster hazard mitigation activities that are cost effective and substantially reduce the risk of future damage, hardship, or suffering from a major disaster. Provides, with respect to such assistance program, for: (1) minimum and maximum per-State allocation of funds; (2) criteria for granting such assistance and determining appropriate amounts; (3) State Governor recommendations of no less than five local governments to receive such assistance; (4) a requirement that at least ten percent of the amount provided in a fiscal year be furnished for activities in communities of 3,000 or fewer individuals that are economically disadvantaged; (5) a Federal cost-share limit (with a higher authorized Federal share for mitigation activities in small impoverished communities); (6) an authorization of appropriations for FY 1998 through 2000; and (7) a report from the President to the Congress evaluating implementation efforts and on a process for transferring to capable States greater responsibility for administering the program. (Sec. 105) Directs the President to establish an interagency task force to coordinate the implementation of the predisaster hazard mitigation program authorized under the Act. (Sec. 106) Increases from 15 to 20 percent the maximum contribution for hazard mitigation costs with respect to a major disaster declared after January 1, 1997. Title II: Streamlining and Cost Reduction - Directs the President to: (1) establish management cost rates for disaster preparedness and mitigation assistance grantees and subgrantees; and (2) review such rates at least every three years.
