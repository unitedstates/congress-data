    "text": "Gun Safety Act - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit the transfer or possession of a junk gun that has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. Defines a \"junk gun\" as any firearm that does not meet specified criteria for authorization by the Secretary of the Treasury for importation into the United States. Makes such provision inapplicable to: (1) the possession or transfer of any junk gun otherwise lawfully possessed under Federal law on the date of this Act's enactment; (2) any firearm or replica of a firearm that has been rendered permanently inoperative; (3) the transfer to, or possession by, the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State or a transfer to or possession by a law enforcement officer employed by such an entity for law enforcement purposes (whether on or off duty); or (4) the transfer or possession of a junk gun by a licensed manufacturer or licensed importer for the purposes of testing or experimentation authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury. Prohibits the manufacture or importation of a firearm that does not have as an integral part a device or devices that: (1) prevent a child under age seven from discharging it; (2) prevent a firearm that has a removable magazine from discharging when the magazine has been removed; and (3) in the case of a handgun other than a revolver, clearly indicate whether the magazine or chamber contains a round of ammunition. Makes an exception for the manufacture or importation of a firearm by or for the United States or a State. Sets penalties for violations."
