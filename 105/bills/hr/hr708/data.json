Requires that the study: (1) assess the significance of the ranching use and pastoral character of the land, including its significance to the purposes for which the Park was established; (2) identify any need and practicable means for preservation of the land that is necessary to protect that use and character; (3) recommend a variety of economically feasible and viable tools and techniques to retain the pastoral qualities of the land; and (4) estimate the costs of implementing preservation recommendations. Requires the Secretary to: (1) reinstate and extend for the duration of such study and until such recommendations are implemented certain expired grazing privileges in and adjacent to the Park; and (2) cancel the extension with respect to any portion of the land that is disposed of in a manner that would result in it no longer being used for ranching or other agricultural purposes."
