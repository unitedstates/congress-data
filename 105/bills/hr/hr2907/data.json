Prohibits any Department of Defense funds from being used for the acquisition of any such landmine or for any other antipersonnel or antitank landmine that is not self-destructive. Directs the Secretary to certify to the Congress whether such demilitarization compliance would adversely affect the U.S. national security interest. Terminates such demilitarization and prohibition upon a positive certification. Expresses the sense of the Congress that all other nations should take steps to eliminate nonself-destructive landmines from their military inventories."
