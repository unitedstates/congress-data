    "text": "Empowerment Zone Enhancement and Rural Enterprise Communities Act of 1998 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to authorize: (1) 33 additional rural enterprise communities (with an extended designation deadline); (2) a special designation exception for certain areas based upon emigration, underemployment, or economic adjustment; and (3) empowerment zone eligibility for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Provides for: (1) designation priority to be given to well performing enterprise communities (with discretionary set-asides for satisfactorily performing communities); and (2) additional specified grants and grant amounts for rural empowerment zones and rural enterprise communities. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to use certain community planning amounts under the Social Security Act to help communities apply for empowerment zone or enterprise community designation. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to repeal the increased expensing restriction for developable noncontiguous sites. Amends the Social Security Act to provide that: (1) the Secretaries of Agriculture and of Housing and Urban Development, rather than the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall assume certain environmental review responsibility for the urban and rural empowerment zone and enterprise community grants; and (2) the Secretaries may permit fund release for particular projects on the assumption of such responsibility by States, local governments, or Indian tribes. Amends the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 to authorize conveyance of Department of Agriculture excess property to support empowerment zones and enterprise communities."
