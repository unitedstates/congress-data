Prohibits cost sharing or other limitations higher than those applied to similar services. Regulates coverage frequency. Prohibits related enrollment or coverage discrimination, monetary incentives to women, and penalties against or incentives to providers. Allows State laws providing greater protection to women. Amends the Public Health Service Act to apply these requirements to health insurance issuers in the individual market."
