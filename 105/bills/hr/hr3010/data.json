(Sec. 4) Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should use all diplomatic means to press for an equitable, fair, and permanent resolution to the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh (Armenia and Azerbaijan) and other regional conflicts. (Sec. 5) Declares the sense of the Congress that the United States should, where appropriate, support the establishment of neutral, multinational peacekeeping forces to implement peace agreements reached between belligerents in the countries of the South Caucasus. Declares the sense of the Congress that the United States should: (1) assist the countries of the South Caucasus to develop laws and regulations that would facilitate the ability of those countries to join the World Trade Organization; (2) provide permanent nondiscriminatory trade treatment (most-favored-nation status) to such countries; and (3) consider the establishment of zero-to-zero tariffs between them and the United States. Declares the sense of the Congress that the U.S. representatives to the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development should encourage lending to the countries of the South Caucasus to assist the development of the physical infrastructure necessary for regional economic cooperation. Declares the sense of the Congress that the United States should encourage and assist the development of regional military cooperation among the countries of the South Caucasus through programs such as the Central Asian Battalion and the Partnership for Peace of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Declares the sense of the Congress that the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe-Radio Liberty should maintain high quality broadcasting for the maximum duration possible in the native languages of the countries of the South Caucasus. Prohibits, unless important to the U.S. national interest, assistance to such countries if the President determines and certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that they: (1) are engaged in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights; (2) have established any border closure or use of an economic blockade; (3) have knowingly transferred controlled missile or missile technology to another country, or any equipment or technology that would contribute to the ability of such country to manufacture weapons of mass destruction (including nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons); (4) have supported acts of international terrorism; (5) are prohibited from receiving such assistance by specified Acts; or (6) have initiated an act of aggression against another state in the region. (Sec. 6) Directs the President to report annually to appropriate congressional committees."
