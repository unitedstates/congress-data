    "text": "Mandates annual claim maintenance fees of $100 per claim per calendar year (except shale claims subject to claim maintenance fees under the Energy Policy Act of 1992). Reduces such fees by the amount of the claim maintenance fees paid under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. Allows the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the Minerals Management Service (MMS), to waive claim maintenance fees for claim holders that, with all related parties, held no more than ten claims on lands open to location. States that the claim interest of any co-owner who fails to contribute his portion of the claim maintenance fee shall become the property of the co-owners who have paid the required fee. Subjects the production of locatable minerals located under the general mining laws (including their concentrates and products) to a royalty payment of eight percent of the gross income. Prescribes guidelines for the duties of claim holders, operators, and transporters. Authorizes the Secretary to require by rule that transporters possess documentation showing the amount, origin, and intended destination of the locatable mineral, concentrate or product. Prescribes recordkeeping, reporting, and auditing requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with the Secretary of Agriculture to implement this Act. Provides for: (1) interest and substantial underreporting assessments in cases of tardy or delinquent mining claim royalty payments; and (2) several and joint liability for royalty payments on all locatable minerals, concentrates, or products derived therefrom which are lost or wasted due to negligence or noncompliance with regulations. Directs the Secretary to adjust dollar amounts every ten years for changes in the purchasing power of the dollar."
