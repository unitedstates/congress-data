    "text": "Balanced Budget Requirement Act of 1996 (sic) - Amends specified Federal law to require that each President's budget submission to Congress include a detailed plan to achieve a balanced Federal budget for that fiscal year and each of the following four fiscal years (beginning with the budget submission for FY 1998, which shall include a detailed plan to achieve a balanced budget by FY 2002, and then for any budget submission for any fiscal year after FY 2002). Suspends such requirement for any fiscal year covered by a joint resolution declaring war or a national economic or national security emergency. Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office to certify whether such balanced budget plan does achieve a balanced budget. Authorizes the President to submit a revised detailed plan if the original plan is not certified as achieving a balanced budget. Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (CBA) to provide that: (1) beginning with FY 1998, it shall not be in order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any concurrent resolution on the budget that does not achieve a balanced budget by FY 2002; and (2) beginning with FY 2002 it shall not be in order to consider any concurrent resolution on the budget that does not maintain a balanced budget for that fiscal year and for each of the following four fiscal years. Suspends such requirement when there is a joint resolution declaring war or a national economic or national security emergency. Amends CBA to make it in order, in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, to consider any amendment to a concurrent resolution on the budget for a fiscal year reflecting, without substantive change, the budget submitted by the President for that fiscal year and, if different, a separate amendment reflecting the detailed plan to achieve a balanced budget submitted by the President."
