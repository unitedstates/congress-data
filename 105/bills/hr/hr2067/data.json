Requires the redesign of U.S. currency to be cost-effective and have: (1) readily identifiable denominations; (2) no need for special devices other than everyday aids for identification of currency by the visually impaired; and (3) tactile features (including color and size features) to enable the blind and the visually impaired to use the currency."
