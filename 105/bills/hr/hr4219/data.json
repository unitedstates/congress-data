Repeals the current limitation on program residents to those in a hospital with respect to the hospital's most recent cost reporting period ending on or before December 31, 1996. Replaces such limitation with one based on the number of residents who were appointed by a hospital's approved medical residency training program for such reporting period. Waives the limitation for hospitals that sponsor only one allopathic or osteopathic residency program. Limits to programs established between January 1, 1995, and September 30, 1999, (currently, programs established on or after January 1, 1995) the mandate for special rules applying limitations on interns and residents in any kind of medical residence training program. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in promulgating such rules, to include in the special consideration for facilities meeting the needs of underserved rural areas any facility not located in an underserved rural area which has established a separately accredited rural training track."
