    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1998-03-19", 
    "text": "Pay for Your Stay Act - Amends the Federal criminal code to direct the Attorney General to establish by rule: (1) the requirement that Federal prisoners work at least 48 hours each week if able to do so and engage in educational study at least 12 hours each week; (2) that no television viewing will be provided to such prisoners, except educational programs; and (3) that a 25 percent assessment will be levied on prisoner wages, with five percent returned to the prosecuting agency, ten percent set aside for victim restitution, and ten percent placed in the fund created by this Act. Establishes in the U.S. Treasury the James Wilson, Jr. Fund. Requires the Attorney General to distribute money in the Fund equally between: (1) State and local programs whose primary purpose is to provide training and purchase equipment designed to protect peace officers; and (2) families of local, State, and Federal peace officers killed in the line of duty. Directs the Attorney General to establish a system whereby inmate labor may be utilized to mediate the damage caused by an impending natural disaster or to remediate the damage done by such a disaster. Requires the Attorney General, in implementing requirements of this Act, to: (1) maximize the employment of inmates regarding the operation and maintenance of Federal corrections institutions, and in certain work-based vocational education and skill training activities, and to augment governmental personnel and community volunteers in preparing for a natural disaster or in conducting remediation activities immediately after such a disaster; and (2) assure that inmate labor does not supplant post-disaster remediation activities that would otherwise be performed under contract by private sector firms employed by an affected individual or governmental entity. Provides that any expansion in the inmate production of products or services to be offered for sale resulting from such implementation: (1) may be sold only through Federal Prison Industries (FPI) to Federal agencies on a competitive basis; and (2) shall be approved for sale by the Board of Directors of FPI after determining that the proposed volume of sales is not expected to have an adverse impact on sales to the Government by a private sector contractor offering the same specific product or service. Amends the Federal judicial code to require a prisoner seeking to bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding without prepayment of fees or security (i.e., proceeding in forma pauperis) to submit a statement of all assets the prisoner possesses."
