Determines such credit upon a maximum annual contribution of $500 per account holder and an age-based percentage. Excludes account distributions from gross income if used to pay the holder's qualified higher education expenses, and provides for an additional tax and credit recapture (with exceptions) if used otherwise. Sets forth related reporting requirements."
