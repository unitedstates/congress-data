    "text": "Tax Dollars Accountability Act - Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to: (1) reserve from obligation and expenditure five percent of the discretionary appropriations for a fiscal year for an agency (or component thereof) that does not receive an unqualified opinion on its annual financial statements for the previous fiscal year as part of the agency audit; and (2) make available to such agency the amounts reserved upon the receipt of an unqualified opinion. Requires the Director and the head of an agency, for each audit that does not result in an unqualified or qualified opinion on the agency's financial statements, to jointly submit to the Appropriations Committees, the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, and the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs a statement that identifies the agency's officers and employees responsible for: (1) financial management; and (2) the preparation and production of the financial statements. Requires the President (in the case of an officer appointed by the President) or agency head (in the case of any other officer or employee) to remove from office or employment each officer or employee identified for two consecutive years in such a statement. Extends from 1997 to 1999 the deadline for the submission of the first of such annual financial statements. Requires the submission of such statements to the Congress (currently, they are submitted only to the Director)."
