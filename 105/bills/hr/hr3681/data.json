Requires the Administrator, at least once every five years, to: (1) review and adjust for inflation such size standard for an enterprise deemed a small business for purposes of competing for Federal contracting opportunities based solely on annual revenues; and (2) report to the Congress and the President on findings and conclusions reached upon such review."
