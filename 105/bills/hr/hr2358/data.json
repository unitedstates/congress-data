(Sec. 4) Authorizes appropriations for FY 1998 and 1999 for: (1) additional diplomatic personnel at U.S. posts in China and Nepal to monitor political repression in China; and (2) the National Endowment for Democracy to promote democracy, civil society, and the development of the rule of law in China. Directs the Secretary to use funds in the East Asia-Pacific Regional Democracy Fund to provide grants to nongovernmental organizations to promote the aforementioned goals. (Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary to report annually to specified congressional committees on human rights in China, including religious persecution, the development of democratic institutions, and the rule of law. Directs the Secretary to establish a Prisoner Information Registry for China which shall provide information on all political prisoners, prisoners of conscience, and prisoners of faith in China. (Sec. 7) Expresses the sense of the Congress that it, the President, and the Secretary should work with governments of other countries to establish a Commission on Security and Cooperation in Asia which would be modeled after the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
