    "text": "Federal Oil Royalty Protection Act of 1998 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to establish separate rules to govern the calculation of the value for Federal royalty purposes of crude oil produced by independent and integrated producers from any Federal onshore or Outer Continental Shelf lease. Prescribes requirements and optional features of such rules with respect to: (1) integrated producers; (2) independent producers' gross proceeds; or (3) independent producers' market-based methods. (Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary to establish a single set of rules to govern such calculations if it is determined not to establish separate rules. (Sec. 4) Declares all royalty rate reductions for stripper and heavy oil granted by the Secretary for oil produced from any Federal onshore lease cancelled as of the first day of the first production month following enactment of this Act. Requires a lessee to remit royalties at the rate established under its lease as of the first full production month following enactment of this Act. Retains existing royalty rate reductions for stripper and heavy oil applicable to independent producers' leases until September 1999 or (if earlier) cancellation by the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to grant royalty rate reductions under specified circumstances. (Sec. 5) Prohibits the rate charged to any Outer Continental Shelf lessee or lease operator for oil or gas transportation on any pipeline from the lease to an onshore sales or delivery point from exceeding actual oil pipeline transportation costs as determined by the Secretary, plus a reasonable rate of return not to exceed the prime rate. (Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary to: (1) promptly review and determine the extent to which each Mineral Leasing Act holder of a right-of-way or permit, and each pipeline operator, has complied with specified statutory requirements; and (2) revoke such right-of-way or permit for non-compliance with such Act. (Sec. 7) Amends the 1998 Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act to repeal the prohibition on the use of appropriations to issue a notice of final rulemaking before October 1, 1998, with respect to crude oil valuation for royalty purposes."
