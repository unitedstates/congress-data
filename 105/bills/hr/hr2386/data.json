Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President, upon the request of the Taiwan Government, and in accordance with such study results, should transfer to the Taiwan Government defense articles or services under the foreign military sales program of the Arms Export Control Act for the purpose of establishing and operating a local-area ballistic missile defense system to protect Taiwan and specified islands against limited ballistic missile attacks. Declares that it is in the U.S. national interest that Taiwan be included in any effort at ballistic missile defense cooperation, networking, or interoperability with friendly and allied nations in the Asia-Pacific region. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Clinton Administration should make clear to the People's Republic of China the firm commitment of the American people for security and democracy for the people of Taiwan, and that the United States fully expects the peaceful resolution of security issues on both sides of the Taiwan Strait."
