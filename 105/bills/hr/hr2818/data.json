    "text": "Amends Federal law to repeal the recreational fee demonstration program. Requires each person: (1) producing locatable minerals from any mining claim located under the general mining laws, or mineral concentrates derived from such a claim, to pay the United States a royalty of five percent of the net smelter return from such minerals or concentrates; and (2) responsible to make royalty payments to the Secretary of the Interior within 30 days after the end of the calendar month in which the minerals or concentrates are produced and first placed in marketable condition, consistent with prevailing practices in the industry. Sets forth reporting and audit requirements. Directs that all receipts from royalties collected under this Act be available to increase the quality of the visitor experience at public recreational sites, for backlogged repair and maintenance projects at such sites, and for interpretation, signage, habitat or facility enhancement, resource preservation, annual operation and maintenance of public recreation sites, and law enforcement relating to public use of such areas, to be allocated as follows: (1) 20 percent to the Forest Service; (2) 70 percent to the National Park Service; (3) three percent to the Fish and Wildlife Service; (4) six percent to the Bureau of Land Management; and (5) one percent to the Department of the Interior for administrative costs. Imposes a civil penalty of up to $10,000 upon any person holding mining claims located under the general mining laws who knowingly or willfully prepares, maintains, or submits false, inaccurate, or misleading information, or fails or refuses to submit information, required by this Act."
