    "text": "Medicare Contracting Flexibility Act of 1998 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act with respect to flexibility in contracting for Medicare claims processing. Allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Health Care Financing Administration, to contract for claims processing with carriers that are not insurance companies. Requires the Secretary, at least every five years, to permit each service provider, including a group of hospitals or a group of another class of providers under common ownership by or control of a particular entity, to choose a fiscal intermediary from among those the Secretary proposes. Revises and reduces the number of contract performance requirements the Secretary must develop for fiscal intermediaries. Permits the non-competitive term renewal of a contract with any fiscal intermediary that has met or exceeded performance requirements. Waives competitive requirements for fiscal intermediary contracts entered within into within a certain period after enactment of this Act. Requires year 2000 compliance by fiscal intermediaries and carriers."
