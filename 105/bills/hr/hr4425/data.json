    "text": "Personal Privacy Protection Act - Amends the Federal criminal code to provide that whoever, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce and for commercial purposes, persistently follows or chases a person in a manner that causes that person to have a reasonable fear of bodily injury, in order to capture by a visual or auditory recording instrument any type of visual image, sound recording, or other physical impression of that person, shall: (1) if death or serious bodily injury results, be fined, imprisoned, or both; and (2) be liable in a civil action for appropriate relief. Provides for civil liability for anyone who, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce and for commercial purposes, engages in a tortious invasion of the privacy of another person in order to capture by a visual or auditory recording instrument any type of visual image, sound recording, or other physical impression of that person. Specifies that: (1) it shall not be a defense to a prosecution or civil action that no image or recording was captured or sold; and (2) only a person physically present at the time of, and engaging or assisting another in engaging in, a violation is subject to criminal charge or civil liability under this Act. Makes this Act's prohibitions inapplicable to official law enforcement activities."
