Provides that nothing in this Act shall invalidate or otherwise affect determinations made before this Act's enactment with respect to any natural landscape feature. Prohibits the Mt. Shasta area in California from being designated by any U.S. agency or authority as a historic district, historic site, or national monument under the Act or the Antiquities Act. Ceases the force and effect of any inconsistent designation made before enactment of this Act."
