    "text": "Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 1997 - Amends Federal armed forces provisions to require that a member of the armed forces who submits an allegation of a retaliatory personnel action taken against such member due to the reporting of a wrongdoing by another member (whistleblowing) be assigned a judge advocate to represent such member during any proceedings or investigation in connection with such allegation. Requires such whistleblower provision to be posted in a prominent location in each military installation or vessel to which more than 100 military personnel are assigned. Allows a member to make such an allegation within 120 (currently 60) days after the member becomes aware of the personnel action that is the subject of the allegation."
