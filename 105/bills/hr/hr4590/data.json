    "text": "Education Flexibility Amendments of 1998 - Amends the Goals 2000: Educate America Act to authorize the Secretary of Education to allow all States to participate in the Education Flexibility Partnership Demonstration Act (Ed-Flex) program. Includes State and local programs for school technology resources under the Educational and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) among programs for which requirements may be waived under Ed-Flex. Revises State eligibility requirements for Ed-Flex. Requires States to: (1) have approved challenging content standards, challenging performance measures, and aligned assessments in place or have made substantial progress towards having an approved plan under ESEA title I; and (2) hold local educational agencies (LEAs) accountable for meeting the educational goals submitted in their local applications for waivers, and for taking corrective actions if they have not met such goals. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out the Ed-Flex program for FY 1999 through 2003. Sets forth accountability requirements. Requires the Secretary, in deciding whether to extend the authority of a State educational agency (SEA) to issue waivers, to review the SEA's progress to determine if it has: (1) established procedures for increasing the percentage of elementary school and secondary school teachers in the State who have demonstrated, by traditional or alternative routes, subject matter knowledge and pedagogical skill to provide effective instruction in appropriate content areas; and (2) decreased the percentage of elementary school and secondary school teachers teaching in high poverty elementary schools and secondary schools who do not demonstrate such knowledge and skills."
