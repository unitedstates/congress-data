Requires: (1) the Director of the National Institute of Justice to survey State and local witness protection and relocation programs to determine the extent, nature, and training needs of such programs and report the results to the Congress; and (2) the Attorney General, based on the survey results, to make available to State and local law enforcement agencies a training program to assist in developing and managing effective, safe witness protection and relocation programs. Makes any agency that fails to comply with the notification requirement ineligible to participate in the training program. Authorizes appropriations."
