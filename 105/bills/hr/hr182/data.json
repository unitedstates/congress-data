    "text": "Federal Living Wage Responsibility Act - Requires any employer under a Federal contract or subcontract exceeding $10,000 to pay each employee working on or hired in conjunction with such contract or subcontract the greater of: (1) $7.50 an hour; or (2) an hourly wage necessary for such employee to earn, while working 40 hours a week on a full-time basis, the amount of the Federal poverty level for a family of four. Exempts employers that are: (1) small business concerns; or (2) nonprofit, tax-exempt organizations, if the ratio of the total compensation of the chief executive officer to that of the full-time equivalent of their lowest-paid employee is not greater than 25 to 1. Makes ineligible for such required living wage level any employee participating in: (1) an apprenticeship program; or (2) any other training program, which is not longer than six months and is offered to an employee while employed in productive work, that provides training, technical and other related skills, and personal skills essential to full and adequate job performance. Prohibits employers from avoiding paying the required living wage by laying off or otherwise terminating an employee with the intention of replacing that employee with one not eligible for such wage because of participation in an apprenticeship or training program. Requires all Federal contracts and subcontracts to require such living wage payment. Requires Federal contract and subcontract suspension and a five-year ineligibility period for employers who violate such requirement. Makes such employers liable for unpaid wages and an equal amount of liquidated damages. Directs the Secretary of Labor to pay the employees who were not paid such living wage the amount recovered from their employers."
