    "text": "Judicial Mandate and Remedy Clarification Act - Amends the Federal judicial code to prohibit any district court from entering any order or approving any settlement that: (1) requires a State or political subdivision to impose, increase, levy, or assess a tax; or (2) has the effect of imposing, increasing, levying, or assessing any tax. Permits a district court to issue an order or approve a settlement that requires a State or political subdivision to implement a spending measure for the purpose of enforcing any Federal or State common law or statutory or constitutional right or law only if the court finds that specified conditions exist, including that: (1) there are no other means available to remedy the violation; (2) the spending measure is narrowly tailored to remedy the violation; and (3) plans submitted by State and local authorities will not effectively redress the violation. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) judicial review of the court's findings; (2) a right of certain aggrieved persons, corporations, or unincorporated associations to intervene in proceedings concerning implementation of a spending measure; and (3) termination of any such order or settlement after one year or earlier if the court determines that the violation of rights has been cured to the extent practicable."
