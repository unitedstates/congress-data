    "text": "Rex Brewer Social Security Disability Fairness and Equity Act of 1998 - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to waive the waiting period otherwise required for disability beneficiaries in the case of individuals with terminal illnesses with not more than six months to live. Amends SSA titles II and XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI): (1) in the case of the OASDI program, to provide for payments to State and local prisons for monthly reports on the identities of inmates whose OASDI benefits cease to become payable as a result of such reports; and (2) in the case of the SSI program, to provide that no amount shall be payable to such an institution with respect to such information if the Commissioner of Social Security has determined, before receiving substantiating information from the institution, that the prisoner is no longer eligible for SSI. Transfers from the OASDI trust funds any sums necessary to enable the Commissioner to make such payments. Eliminates the SSA title II requirement that confinement stem only from a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. Provides for a 50 percent reduction in institution payments under both SSA title II and XVI in cases involving a comparable payment under the other title with respect to the same prisoner. Exempts OASDI and SSI matches performed under this Act from computer matching requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974."
