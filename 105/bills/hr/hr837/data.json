    "text": "Fair Debt Collection Practices Amendments of 1997 - Amends the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act to require that the consumer notify the debt collector in writing of any dispute within 30 days of receiving a debt notice or the debt will automatically be considered valid. Allows the debt collector to: (1) demand payment of a debt, and attempt to collect it, within the 30 days after giving the consumer notice; and (2) obtain information concerning location, income, asset, or credit of the consumer from any person besides the consumer's lawyer if the lawyer refuses to provide such information. Declares that such Act provides no remedy, liability, or penalty for violations of State law. Excuses a debt collector from liability for violations of such Act resulting from the use of a form of written communication approved by any State or Federal agency. Requires a court, in determining whether a debt collector has failed to comply with such Act, to consider the effect of any act or omission of the debt collector upon a reasonable person."
