    "text": "Requires that a life or disability insurer, if the insurer requires an applicant for life or disability insurance to submit to a medical examination or test, ensure disclosure to the applicant of the test results. Prohibits the insurer from disclosing the results to any other person, except under a written authorization made by the applicant, pursuant to certain legal process, or to a public health authority when expressly required by law. Provides for civil actions for violations of this Act by any aggrieved person, allowing recovery of statutory, compensatory, and punitive damages and attorney's fees. Declares that, for provisions of Federal law commonly known as the McCarran-Ferguson Act prohibiting Federal insurance law from preempting State law unless the Federal law specifically relates to the business of insurance, this Act shall be considered to specifically relate to the business of insurance."
