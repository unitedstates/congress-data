(Such elements are currently designated for an allocation reduction from FY 1996 amounts under the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation System developed by the Secretary and submitted to the Congress in March 1997.) Provides an exception on a pro rata basis with respect to any general appropriations reductions. Directs the Secretary, effective with FY 2000, to ensure that each such Network is allocated an amount for medical care that is not less than 90 percent of the product of: (1) the number of veterans residing in the geographic area of that Network; and (2) the national medical services and administrative cost per veteran."
