Provides the same protection to a surviving spouse who was living with another person before such date and who subsequently ceases to live with such person. Limits the DIC rate payable to such individuals to 50 percent of the rate provided to other surviving spouses. Directs the Secretary to notify such individuals of their DIC eligibility."
