Amends part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) of title IV of the Social Security Act to establish a program of grants to States for school-based child care. Sets forth grant application and allotment requirements. Reserves a portion of program funds for Indian tribes. Requires recipient States to: (1) provide such grant funds to LEAs for specified uses; (2) ensure that such funds are expended in coordination with State- established programs under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990; and (3) use such funds to supplement and not supplant other Federal, State, and local funds provided for programs that serve the health and developmental needs of children. Makes appropriations for such grants for FY 1999 through 2002."
