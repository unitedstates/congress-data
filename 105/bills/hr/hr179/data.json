    "text": "Clean Sweep Act of 1997 - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) to require that the majority of a House of Representatives candidate's contributors (with respect to an election cycle) reside in the congressional district involved. Excepts contributions from a national, State, district, or local political party committee (including any subordinate committee thereof). (Sec. 3) Bans Federal election activities by political action committees. (Sec. 4) Limits contributions or loans of the personal funds of a House candidate (including funds of members of the candidate's immediate family) during a calendar year which in the aggregate exceed $50,000. (Sec. 5) Requires that amounts paid by the national, State, or local political party committee (including a subordinate committee thereof) for mixed political activities: (1) shall be subject to limitation and reporting requirements as if such payment were an expenditure; and (2) may be paid only from an account that is subject to the requirements of FECA. (Sec. 6) Sets forth provisions concerning eligibility and certification for reduced broadcast rates for House candidates who limit the total amount of expenditures made during an election cycle. Imposes a penalty upon a candidate who makes expenditures in excess of the limit. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to entitle certified candidates to receive free broadcast time from broadcasting stations within the candidate's State or an adjacent State, except where only one candidate qualifies to be on the ballot. Exempts certain licensees. (Sec. 7) Amends FECA to prohibit contributions by an individual who is not a citizen of the United States. (Sec. 8) Bans any contribution of U.S. or foreign currency to any candidate or political committee with respect to any Federal election campaign. (Sec. 9) Revises Federal law relating to mass mailings sent by House members. (Sec. 10) Directs the Committee on House Oversight to submit a report to the President and the Congress analyzing the effects of changes made by this Act on the first general elections for the House which are held after December 31, 1998."
