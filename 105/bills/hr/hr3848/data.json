    "text": "Foreign Sovereign Immunity Technical Corrections Act of 1998 - Amends the Federal judicial code to revise the exemption from foreign sovereign immunity when money damages are sought against a foreign state for personal injury or death caused by a specified kind of violent act engaged in or materially supported by an official, employee, or agent of such foreign state. Extends the exemption from foreign sovereign immunity to foreign states which are not designated state sponsors of terrorism, but which have no treaty of extradition with the United States at the time the act occurred, and no adequate and available remedies conforming with fundamental fairness and due process. Sets forth a statute of limitations for actions against such a state, declaring that no action may be brought for a cause of action that arose more than 20 years before the enactment of this Act."
