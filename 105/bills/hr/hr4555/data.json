    "text": "Endangered Species Criminal and Civil Penalties Liability Reform Act - Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to define \"take\" to mean to knowingly and intentionally perform any act with the knowledge that the act would constitute harassing, harming, pursuing, hunting, shooting, wounding, killing, trapping, capturing, or collecting an individual member of a species that was present at the time and location of the act, or to attempt to engage in such conduct. Prohibits a person from being liable for any criminal or civil penalty for a violation committed while conducting an otherwise lawful activity and not for the purpose of a prohibited taking, unless: (1) the Secretary of the Interior provides the person with notice of the violation; and (2) the person fails to terminate and correct the activity constituting the violation by not later than 30 days after the date of the notice. Requires each conservation plan developed to include provisions under which persons who have entered into, and are in compliance with, the conservation plan may not, without their consent, be required to undertake any additional mitigation measures for species covered by the plan if the measures would require payment or compliance with use, development, or management restrictions on any land, waters, or water related rights, in addition to payments or compliance, respectively, otherwise required under the terms of the plan. Requires such provisions, among other matters, to identify modifications to the plan or additional conservation measures, if any, that the Secretary may require under extraordinary circumstances. Makes it an affirmative defense, in any enforcement action or citizen suit in which it is alleged that a defendant acted or failed to act with respect to a member of an endangered or threatened species, that the defendant could not reasonably have known that the fish or wildlife or plant concerned is a member of an endangered or threatened species. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) enter into \"safe harbor\" agreements with non-Federal persons to benefit the conservation of endangered or threatened species by creating, restoring, or improving habitat or by maintaining currently unoccupied habitat; and (2) provide a grant of up to $10,000 to any individual private landowner to assist the landowner in carrying out such an agreement."
