Sets forth congressional procedures for termination of the embargo. Specifies plant nutrient materials among the agricultural commodities whose export the President may not prohibit or curtail if: (1) the export sales contract for such materials is entered into before he or she announces an action that would otherwise prohibit or curtail their export; and (2) the contract terms require delivery of the materials within 270 days after the date of the suspension of trade is imposed. Amends the Arms Export Control Act to exempt Department of Agriculture financial assistance for the purchase or other provision of food or other agricultural commodities from the prohibition against extensions of U.S. Government credit, credit guarantees, or other financial assistance to countries involved in the transfer or use of nuclear explosive devices."
