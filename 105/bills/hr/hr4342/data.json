(Sec. 1003) Amends the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to allow certain entries of television receivers, monitors, and picture tubes, and combination TV-VCRs with a diagonal measurement of up to 34.29cm (currently, 33.02 cm), or 13.5 inches, to be classified as 13 inches for purposes of tariff treatment under the Schedule. Directs the Customs Service, upon proper request, to liquidate or reliquidate certain entries made on or after January 1, 1995, and before 15 days after enactment of this Act, as if such amendment applied to such entries.
