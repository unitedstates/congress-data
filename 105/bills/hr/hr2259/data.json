Requires the lands transferred to the United States to be managed in accordance with the Alaska National Lands Conservation Act. Deems such transferred land interests to be of equal value. Directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Aleutians East Borough to jointly develop and agree to reasonable terms and conditions for the use of such right of way which will protect the Federal lands, interest in lands, and resources beneath and adjacent to the right-of-way without imposing undue costs on either party."
