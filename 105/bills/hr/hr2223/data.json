Permits such transfers to be made at a discount or no cost. Requires the Secretary to provide for a no-cost transfer to a local governmental entity for public school purposes if the Secretary determines that the charges for such lands would impose an undue hardship on such an entity. Declares that such transfers shall be conditioned on the requirement that the lands so transferred will be used solely for public school purposes. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, upon receipt of an application from a duly qualified local education agency that is seeking conveyance of land for use for a school, to: (1) notify the applicant of such receipt before the end of the ten-day period beginning on the date of receipt; and (2) before the end of the 90-day period beginning on such date, determine whether or not to convey such land and to notify the applicant of that determination, or report to the Congress and the applicant the reasons that determination has not been made."
