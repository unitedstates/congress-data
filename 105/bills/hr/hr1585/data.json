Requires the Service to pay 70 percent of the amounts attributable (additional revenues minus costs) to such differential to the National Institutes of Health and the remainder to the Department of Defense under arrangements as mutually agreed, provided payments are made at least twice a year. Requires the Postmaster General to include in each annual report to the Board of Governors information concerning the operation of this Act. Terminates the provisions of this Act at the end of the two-year period beginning on the date on which such postage stamps are first made available to the public.
