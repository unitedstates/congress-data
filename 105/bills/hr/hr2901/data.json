Directs the FCC to: (1) award licensees under such proceeding within 90 days after enactment of this Act; and (2) require such applicant to provide cellular radiotelephone service to subscribers in accordance with FCC rules. Prohibits the FCC, during the three-year period after an applicant license is granted, from authorizing the transfer or assignment of that license."
