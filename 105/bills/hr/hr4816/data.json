Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) develop a study of management alternatives which may provide more coordinated land management within the Lower Alamo watershed, allow for improved management of elk and other wildlife populations ranging between the Santa Fe National Forest and the Bandelier National Monument, and include a proposed boundary adjustment between such Forest and Monument to facilitate those objectives; and (3) submit the study to specified congressional committees. Makes the acquisition of the ranch subject to all outstanding valid existing mineral interests.

Sets forth reporting and funding requirements. (Sec. 205) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a program to complete appraisals and other legal requirements for the sale or exchange of land identified for disposal under approved land use plans maintained and in effect on this title's enactment date.
