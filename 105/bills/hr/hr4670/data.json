    "text": "Women and Children's Resources Act - Mandates annual grants to States for programs to provide: (1) information, education, and counseling on alternatives to abortion and on sexual abstinence, pregnancy testing and follow-up services, and prenatal and postpartum health; and (2) related services, items, and assistance. Makes eligible persons who are: (1) pregnant, the parent or guardian of an infant under 12 months old, or the partner of those individuals; and (2) under a specified income level. Prohibits the programs from performing or making referrals for abortions or providing or making referrals for information, education, or counseling that presents abortion as a pregnancy option. Requires States to carry out the programs through nonprofit private entities, but excludes entities with activities during the preceding five years that present abortion as an option. (Sec. 4) Allows a State to contract with religious organizations on the same basis as any other nongovernmental provider without impairing the religious character of the organization and without diminishing the religious freedom of beneficiaries. Requires that programs be implemented consistent with the establishment clause of the Constitution. Prohibits the Federal and State Governments from discriminating against an organization on the basis that the organization has a religious character. Prohibits a contracting religious organization from discriminating against an individual on the basis of religion, religious belief, or refusal to actively participate in a religious practice. Declares that these provisions do not preempt any provision of a State constitution or State statute restricting the expenditure of State funds in or by religious organizations. (Sec. 6) Sets forth a formula for the allotment of funds to the States. (Sec. 10) Authorizes appropriations."
