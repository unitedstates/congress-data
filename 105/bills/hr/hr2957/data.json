Authorizes any city, State, local government, agency, or instrumentality, or any person responsible for the operation of a heliport, to submit to the Administrator: (1) a study demonstrating that noise or safety conditions, or both, resulting from helicopter operations pose a risk to the public health and welfare of such a county or municipality; and (2) a plan to reduce the risk. Requires the Administrator to review such a plan and, upon determining that helicopter operations pose such a risk, to make any modifications necessary to conform with this Act. Specifies procedures for public comment and implementation of a plan developed in either manner."
