Sets forth the criteria under which an employer plan may meet such standards. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a tax of up to 25 percent of the amounts received by the carrier or under the plan for coverage if a carrier or an employer health benefit plan fails to comply with the standards relating to the nondiscriminatory treatment of neurobiological disorders under this Act."
