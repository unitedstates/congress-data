Requires such products to be constructed through the use of scrap or waste materials that constitute excess property and such services to be used only for the benefit of the recipient. Prohibits such products from being resold or such services from displacing or resulting in a reduction in hours, wages, or employment benefits of any employee of the recipient. Prohibits the provision of goods or services by a Federal penal or correctional facility if such provision would reduce the number of inmates employed at any Federal Prison Industries operations at that facility."
