    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1997-05-21", 
    "text": "Coeur d'Alene River Basin Environmental Restoration Act of 1997 - Establishes in the Treasury the Coeur d'Alene Trust Fund for transfer of funds to the Secretary of the Army for use by the State of Idaho for the Coeur d'Alene River Basin Commission (established by this Act) to develop an action plan to support and enhance natural recovery of the Coeur d'Alene River Basin. Requires submission to the Secretary of a completed action plan by the Governor of Idaho within two years after enactment of this Act. Establishes the Coeur d'Alene River Basin Commission. Limits liability, with exceptions, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Solid Waste Disposal Act for damages attributable to activities in the basin undertaken before enactment of this Act. Exempts: (1) the Governor, Commission, and State of Idaho from liability for any action taken in developing such action plan or for any environmental costs or response resulting from any release or threatened release of a hazardous substance due to mining activity in the Basin undertaken before the enactment of this Act; and (2) any current or former landowner within the Basin from environmental response or action costs or requirements with respect to a mining activity undertaken before the enactment of this Act if the person establishes that any such liability would arise solely on the basis of the transport of the hazardous substance by air, surface, or groundwater pathways from outside the boundaries of such person's property. Permits the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with the Governor and the Commission. Authorizes appropriations."
