Makes the above provisions inapplicable to NWRS units that are designated or specifically authorized to be designated by law. Excludes land located within the boundaries (or proposed boundaries) of a NWRS unit designated after the enactment of this Act from Federal land use restrictions based solely on a determination of the boundaries until an interest in the land has been acquired by the United States."
