Prohibits such recommendations from including changes relating to the payment of payroll taxes for financing the program. Sets forth procedures for expedited congressional consideration of recommendations. Title II: Controlling Outlays Under Medicare Program - Requires Congress, by April 15 of each year, to establish, in the concurrent resolution on the budget for the following fiscal year, a limit on total Medicare program outlays for the fiscal year involved. Provides for the enforcement of such limits through sequestration of outlays under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act)."
