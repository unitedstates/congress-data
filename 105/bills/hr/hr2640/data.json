Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide for periodic re-certification to ensure that the provision of such services complies with appropriate criteria under the Public Health Service Act; and (2) implement a demonstration project under Medicare part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) under which community mental health centers may offer expanded partial hospitalization services which are not currently covered as such under Medicare for purposes of providing for a full continuum of ambulatory behavioral health care services."
