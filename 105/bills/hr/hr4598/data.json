Declares this Act applicable only to land with respect to which the United States owns coal reserved to it in a patent issued under specified Federal law. States that this Act does not: (1) apply to any tribally-owned or State-owned interest in coal or land; or (2) limit the right of any person who entered into a contract or lease for federally-owned coal before, on or after the date of enactment of this Act to mine and remove such coal, and to release coalbed methane without liability to surface patent holders with rights to explore for, extract, sell, or produce coalbed methane."
