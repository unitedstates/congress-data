Requires a Member who becomes ineligible to participate in FERS to be treated in the same way as if separated from service. Makes provisions of this Act inapplicable with respect to: (1) any former Member of Congress who, as of the enactment of this Act, is entitled to a FERS annuity; or (2) any individual who, as of the enactment of this Act, is entitled to any annuity as a survivor of a former Member of Congress."
