    "text": "Trademark Law Treaty Implementation Act - Amends the Trademark Act of 1946 to revise trademark registration requirements. Requires owners of trademarks and persons with bona fide intentions to use trademarks to include verifications attesting to the accuracy of facts in registration applications. Prohibits the registration of any trademark until the applicant has met certain existing requirements with respect to: (1) amending an application for a bona fide intention to use a trademark to conform to requirements for using a trademark in commerce if the applicant has made use of the trademark; and (2) verifying statements that a trademark is used in commerce. Exempts trademarks subject to certain international conventions from such requirements. Provides that failures to file extension requests for filing statements of use shall result in abandonment of registration applications unless shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks that a delay was unintentional. Grants owners of registered trademarks a grace period to make certain affidavits in order to avoid early cancellations of registrations. Revises registration renewal requirements and extends the period in which a renewal may be filed to one year (currently, six months) before the end of each successive ten-year period for which the registration was issued or renewed. Extends the grace period for filing renewals for expired registrations from three to six months after the end of such ten-year period, with payment of a surcharge. Removes a requirement that an application for registration of a foreign trademark be accompanied by a certification or certified copy of the foreign registration. Requires the submission of such documents within such time period as the Commissioner prescribes. Adds: (1) functional trademarks to the list of trademarks which may be cancelled at any time; and (2) functionality to the list of defenses to infringement in cases involving incontestable registrations. Expands remedies for cases involving the willful dilution of famous trademarks to authorize the award of damages and the destruction of infringing articles for such violation."
