Proscribes contractual arrangements authorizing deeper completions or additional drilling. Requires contracts to require contractors to provide a Federal oil and gas bond to ensure complete and timely reclamation of the former lease tract in accordance with regulations of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Forest Service, unless the Secretary accepts in lieu thereof assurances from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Oil and Gas, that: (1) the contractor is in compliance with specified Ohio bonding requirements; (2) the United States is entitled to receive funding under Ohio law to properly plug and restore oil and gas sites and lease tracts; and (3) at least 20 percent of Ohio State severance tax revenues have been allocated to the State of Ohio Orphan Well Fund. Declares that, in entering into any contract under this Act, the Secretary shall reserve the right to require contractor compliance with BLM and Forest Service oil and gas lease bonding requirements whenever the Secretary finds that less than 20 percent of State severance tax revenues has been allocated to such Fund."
