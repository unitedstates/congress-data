Confers oversight responsibility over the Board upon the Secretary of Energy. Requires each electric power generation facility owner or operator, as a condition of transmitting power to any transmitting utility, to contribute funds determined by the Board to be necessary to generate revenues in each calendar year equal to one-half of the aggregate cost of implementing certain public purpose programs. Requires the Board to institute a rulemaking proceeding governing creation and administration of a Public Benefits Program. Authorizes any State to establish one or more public purpose programs and apply for matching funds under the Public Benefits Program. Emphasizes State discretion to elect participation in such Program. Expresses the sense of the Congress that such Program shall not replace or supersede any other existing programs that support or encourage conservation and energy efficiency, renewable energy, universal and affordable service, or research and development."
