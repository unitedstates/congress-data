Makes qualified aliens eligible for SSI benefits who: (1) became blind or disabled after U.S. admission; or (2) were under 18 years old at, and blind or disabled prior to, U.S. admission. Exempts such aliens from: (1) attribution of sponsor income and repayment requirements; and (2) the five-year ineligibility period for Federal means-tested public benefits. Makes permanent resident aliens who are at least 76 years old eligible for SSI benefits. Exempts such aliens from sponsor repayment requirements."
