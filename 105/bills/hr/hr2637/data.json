Anthony. Amends Federal law to mandate that the dollar coin shall: (1) be golden in color, have a distinctive edge, with tactile and visual features making it readily discernible; (2) be minted and fabricated in the United States; and (3) have similar metallic anticounterfeiting properties as U.S. clad coinage in circulation on the date of enactment of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to continue to mint and issue $1 coins bearing the likeness of Susan B. Anthony if the supply of such coins is depleted before production of the coins depicting the Statue of Liberty has begun."
