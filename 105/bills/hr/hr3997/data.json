Declares that, if such an individual has not designated such a provider as a primary care provider, the organization: (1) may not require authorization or referral by the individual's primary care provider, or otherwise, for coverage of routine gynecological care (such as preventive women's health examinations) and pregnancy-related services provided by a participating health care professional who specializes in obstetrics and gynecology to the extent such care is otherwise covered. Authorizes the organization to treat the ordering of other gynecological care by such a participating physician as the authorization of the primary care provider with respect to such care under the Medicare+Choice plan. Requires a Medicare+Choice organization to permit an enrollee undergoing a course of treatment from a health care provider when the contract between organization and provider is terminated to continue or be covered with respect to the course of treatment with the provider during a specified transitional period."
