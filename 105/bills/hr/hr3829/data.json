    "text": "Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 - Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 to authorize an employee or contractor of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) who intends to report to the Congress a complaint or information with respect to an urgent concern to report to the Inspector General (IG) of the CIA. Requires the IG to act on such complaint or information within 60 days and to forward such complaint to the CIA Director. Requires the Director to forward such information to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate within seven days after its receipt. Allows an employee to contact the intelligence committees directly concerning such complaint or information in limited circumstances. Requires IG notification of an employee within three days after taking any action on a complaint or information. Defines a matter of \"urgent concern\" for purposes of this Act as: (1) a serious or flagrant problem, abuse, violation of law or executive order, or deficiency relating to the administration or operation of an intelligence activity involving classified information; (2) a false statement to the Congress, or willful withholding from the Congress, on an issue of material fact relating to the administration or operation of an intelligence activity; or (3) an action constituting reprisal in response to an employee's reporting of an urgent concern. Amends the Inspector General Act of 1978 to authorize employees and contractors of the following agencies who intend to report to the Congress a complaint or information with respect to an urgent concern to report such to the IG of the Department of Defense: the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, and the National Security Agency. Authorizes employees and contractors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who intend to take such action to report to the IG of the Justice Department. Authorizes other Federal employees dealing with foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities who intend to take such action to report to their appropriate IG. Outlines procedures to follow the reporting of such complaint or information, and a definition of \"urgent concern,\" similar to those provided with respect to CIA employees, above."
