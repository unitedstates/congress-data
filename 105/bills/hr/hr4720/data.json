Excludes from the application of this Act any eligible organization that, for reasons of financial hardship, cannot convert a risk-sharing contract to a contract to offer a Medicare+Choice plan. Requires a Medicare+Choice organization offering a Medicare+Choice plan in an area affected by such a contract extension to accept, between November 1, 1998, and June 30, 1999, elections to enroll in such plan by individuals currently enrolled under the contract being extended. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the eligible organization whose contract is being extended to negotiate for a new contract which may enable the organization to convert its contract to a contract to offer a Medicare+Choice plan."
