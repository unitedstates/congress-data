Deems the values of the Federal Property and the Corporation's Property to be equal. States that nothing in this Act shall impact or alter the Corporation's rights, duties, and obligations regarding investigation, remediation, cleanup, and restoration under its September 10, 1995, Commitment Agreement with the State of Alaska or other applicable law. Requires the Corporation Property acquired by the United States to be managed as a part of the Admiralty Island National Monument and the Kootznoowoo Wilderness. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Forest Service, to negotiate with the owners of private property in the Chaik Bay on Admiralty Island, with the objective of acquiring such property. Allows the Secretary to enter into an option to purchase or an exchange agreement with such property owners to be effected either through existing administrative mechanisms provided by law and regulation, or by subsequent ratification by Act of Congress."
