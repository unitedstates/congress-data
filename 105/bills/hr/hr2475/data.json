Defines \"bonded child labor\" to mean work or service: (1) which is exacted from any person under 15 years of age, either in payment for the debts of a parent, relative, or guardian or drawn under false pretexts; and (2) to which such person is confined against his or her will. Authorizes the President to waive requirements prohibiting the importation of articles or merchandise produced or manufactured by convict labor, forced labor, indentured labor, or bonded child labor if it is determined and certified to the Congress that it is in the national interest. Authorizes appropriations."
