    "text": "Electric Utility Nitrogen Oxide Limitation Act of 1997 - Makes it unlawful for any fossil-fuel fired utility unit with a nameplate capacity of greater than 25 megawatts of electrical output to emit nitrogen oxides in excess of a maximum allowable emission standard of 0.35 pounds per million Btu. Cites circumstances under which the owner of several electric utility units within a single State may elect to use alternative contemporaneous annual emission limitations and receive operating permits accordingly. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to issue implementation and enforcement regulations. Sets a deadline after which no unit under this Act may operate without a permit subject to the Clean Air Act. Declares that the requirements of this Act shall be treated as an emission limitation under the Clean Air Act."
