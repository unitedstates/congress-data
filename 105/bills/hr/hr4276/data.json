Sets forth authorized uses of, and limitations on, such funds. Establishes a Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System Fund for the payment of expenses related to the scheduling and transportation of U.S. prisoners and illegal and criminal aliens in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service. Makes appropriations for initial capitalization of the Fund. (Sec. 102) Prohibits the use of funds appropriated by this title to: (1) pay for abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term, or in the case of rape; or (2) require any person to perform or facilitate an abortion. (Sec. 110) Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to remove the authority for beneficiaries of certain petitions for classification or applications for labor certifications to apply to the Attorney General for adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Repeals provisions which allow certain employment-based immigrants to adjust to permanent residence status. Establishes the Immigration Detention and Naturalization Activity Account in the Treasury. Provides for: (1) the deposit of certain application fees into the Account; and (2) refunds to any appropriation for expenses incurred by the Attorney General for the detention of aliens, construction relating to such detention, and activities relating to naturalization.

(Sec. 116) Repeals provisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 that provide for an automated entry and exit control system. Revises provisions requiring aliens to present border identification cards that match appropriate biometric characteristics in order to cross the border to phase in such requirement over a number of years, requiring all cards in circulation as of April 1, 1998, to match by October 1, 2003. (Current law applies such requirement to all cards presented three years after such Act's enactment date.) (Sec. 117) Directs the President, with the FY 2000 budget request, to present the specific dollar amounts budgeted, by appropriation account and line item, for counterterrorism and antiterrorism programs. Requires a narrative outline of the content of, and detail of the amounts budgeted for, each program for FY 1998 through 2000 and the succeeding five years of the Federal Counterterrorism Strategy. (Sec. 118) Amends the Controlled Substances Act to make unlawful certain knowing failures to provide records or reports, including those pertaining to listed chemicals and certain machines. (Current law provides that all failures to do so are unlawful.) Limits penalties for knowing violations regarding reports or recordkeeping to $500 if no unauthorized person obtains unlawful control of a controlled substance as a result of such a violation.

Authorizes revocation of licenses of dealers who fail to have such storage or devices available. (Sec. 122) Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize grants to non-Federal individuals or entities for firearm safety education. (Sec. 123) Amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to prohibit the disposition of a firearm or ammunition to, and the possession of a firearm or ammunition by, an alien who has been admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant visa. Requires the statement required from a firearms transferee to contain a statement that the transferee is not an alien who has been admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant visa. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) exceptions for aliens admitted to the United States for lawful hunting or sporting purposes and for certain official government representatives, officials, distinguished foreign visitors, and foreign law enforcement officers; and (2) waivers. (Sec. 124) Amends the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to require States, in order to receive violent offender incarceration or truth-in-sentencing incentive grants, to have programs of mental health screening and treatment for categories of convicted juvenile and other offenders during periods of incarceration and juvenile and criminal justice supervision. (Current law requires States to implement policies for the recognition of the rights and needs of crime victims in order to be eligible for such grants.) Authorizes grant funds to be applied to such programs.
