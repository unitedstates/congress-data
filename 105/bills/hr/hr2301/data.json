Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to: (1) require that a statement soliciting information of any fraud or abuse be included with every explanation of benefits received and notice of payment made under Medicare; and (2) double the amount of criminal and civil monetary penalties that are assessed for various Medicare violations."
