Sec. 642, the Federal Employees' Retirement System Open Enrollment Act of 1997, authorizes individuals employed by the Federal Government as of January 1, 1998, who are subject to the Civil Serviced Retirement System (CSRS), to elect to become subject to the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) during 1998.)

The following revised digest of H.R. 2378 reflects the Act as signed into law, minus the line-item-vetoed provision. For more information on the specific items vetoed, see the text of the conference report for H.R. 2378, H.Rept. 105-284, and Presidential Cancellation Number 97-56.)
