Allows a coastwise endorsement on the certificate of documentation for certain foreign qualified vessels and vessels of foreign registry (whose nation of registry and of the citizenship or nationality of each owner of record extends reciprocal privileges to U.S. vessels). Renames the requirements for Great Lakes licenses and registry as inland waterways endorsements requirements. Makes conforming amendments to the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 and other related Federal law with respect to transportation of merchandise or passengers, towing and salvaging operations, dredging operations, liability for injury or death of master or crew member, and requisition of coastwise trade vessels during national emergencies."
