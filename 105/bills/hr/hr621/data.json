Provides similar obligations and sanctions with respect to group health plan parity for treatment of mental illness. Title II: Medicare Mental Health Improvement - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to restructure the mental health benefit, including: (1) coverage under Medicare part A (Hospital Insurance) of inpatient hospital services furnished primarily for the diagnosis or treatment of mental illness or substance abuse for up to 60 days during a year, as well as coverage of intensive residential services furnished to an individual for up to 120 days during a year; (2) lower co-payments for certain outpatient mental health and substance abuse services; (3) waiver of co-payment for case management services furnished to a seriously mentally ill adult, a seriously emotionally disturbed child, or an adult or child with serious substance abuse disorder; (4) case management services for an unlimited duration for such individuals; (5) provision of items and services furnished under Medicare part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) for the treatment of mental illness or emotional disturbances according to standards established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services; (6) a new category of intensive community-based services covering, among other services, current partial hospitalization services as well as psychiatric rehabilitation services, in-home services, and day treatment for substance abuse for individuals of any age and for other mental health services for individuals under age 19; (7) mandatory authorization under State law or certification by an appropriate accreditation entity (approved by the State in consultation with the Secretary) for intensive community-based services programs (whether facility-based or freestanding); and (8) supervision of individualized treatment programs by non-physician mental health professionals to the extent permitted under State law."
