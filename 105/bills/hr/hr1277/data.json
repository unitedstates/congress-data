    "text": "Department of Energy Civilian Research and Development Act of 1997 - Authorizes FY 1998 and 1999 appropriations for Department of Energy (DOE): (1) energy supply research and development activities (including energy assets acquisition); (2) general science and research activities (including science assets acquisition); (3) fossil energy research and development activities; and (4) energy conservation research and development activities. Sets forth funding limitations by specifying programs for which the use of funds under this Act is prohibited (except to fulfill contractual obligations). Directs the Secretary of Energy to arrange with the National Academy of Sciences to report to the Congress on: (1) DOE activities concerning high energy and nuclear physics activities within specified budgetary parameters; (2) DOE basic energy sciences activities based upon certain budget options for the entire Basic Energy Sciences account and all related research and energy asset activities; and (3) construction and operation costs of the National Spallation Neutron Source at alternative sites, including the National Laboratories at Argonne, Brookhaven, Los Alamos, and Oak Ridge. Proscribes the use of funds for the Next Generation Internet (except for continuation of FY 1997 activities). Directs the Secretary to exclude from consideration for grant agreements any person who received grant funds from a Federal funding source for a project that was not subjected to a competitive, merit-based award procedure. Expresses the sense of the Congress that DOE should: (1) give high priority to correcting all two-digit date-related problems in its computer systems to ensure that those systems continue to operate effectively beyond the year 2000; (2) assess immediately the extent of the risk to DOE operations posed by such problems, and plan and budget for achieving Year 2000 compliance for its mission-critical systems; and (3) develop contingency plans for systems that DOE is unable to correct in time. Mandates that recipients of funds appropriated under this Act comply with the Buy American Act. Expresses the sense of the Congress that such recipients should purchase only American-made equipment and products with the financial assistance provided under this Act."
