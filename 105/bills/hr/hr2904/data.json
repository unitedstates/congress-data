Makes such exception also with respect to any other existing restrictions on trade with Cuba. Prohibits the President, with specified exceptions, from restricting the exportation to Cuba of medicines or medical supplies, instruments, or equipment, under the Export Administration Act of 1979 or the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Amends the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 to conform to this Act."
