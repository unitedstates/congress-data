    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Reauthorization of Government Programs Title II: Program Inventory Title III: Program Reexamination Title IV: Miscellaneous Sunset Act of 1997 - Title I: Reauthorization of Government Programs - Requires the reauthorization of each Government program, with exceptions, at least once during each sunset reauthorization cycle (the period of five Congresses beginning with the 106th Congress and with each sixth Congress following the 106th Congress) during the Congress in which the reauthorization date applicable to such program occurs. States that the first reauthorization date applicable to a Government program is the date specified in the table provided, and each subsequent reauthorization date applicable to a program is the date that a statute enacted by the Congress establishes. Sets forth procedures for congressional consideration of the authorization or provision of new budget authority. (Sec. 102) Exempts specified programs from such consideration. Title II: Program Inventory - Directs the Comptroller General and the Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in cooperation with the Director of the Congressional Research Service (CRS), to prepare an inventory of Federal programs (the program inventory) to advise and assist the Congress in carrying out the requirements of this Act. Requires the Comptroller General to submit the program inventory to the Senate and the House of Representatives. (Sec. 202) Requires the General Accounting Office (GAO), CRS, and CBO to permit the mutual exchange of available information in their possession which would aid in the compilation of the program inventory. (Sec. 203) Directs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the executive agencies to provide GAO with assistance requested by the Comptroller General in the compilation of the program inventory. (Sec. 204) Sets forth provisions for revising the program inventory. (Sec. 205) Requires the CBO Director and the Comptroller General to include in their reports to the Congress an assessment of the adequacy of the functional and subfunctional categories contained in the table provided for grouping programs of like missions or objectives. Title III: Program Reexamination - Establishes a Joint Committee on Sunset Review (Joint Committee) to review in each odd-numbered year the programs having reauthorization dates occurring on September 30 of the following even-numbered year, to determine (using specified critieria) if such programs should be terminated or reauthorized. Requires the Joint Committee, upon completion of its review of a program, to submit to the appropriate legislative committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate, a recommendation for the extension or termination of the program. (Sec. 302) Requires each executive branch department or agency responsible for the administration of a program subject to reexamination, to submit to OMB and to the Joint Committee a report of its findings, recommendations, and justifications with respect to the matters set forth in the Joint Committee's recommendation, and OMB to submit to the Joint Committee such comments as it deems appropriate. Title IV: Miscellaneous - Amends Federal law to permit an officer or employee of an agency to submit to the Congress or a congressional committee an appropriation request at the request of either a House or Senate committee or of the Joint Committee on Sunset Review after the day on which the President transmits the budget to the Congress for the fiscal year. (Sec. 404) Directs the head of an agency, when requested, to assist in the review or reexamination of a program, to provide to each House and Senate committee which has legislative jurisdiction over such program, or to the Joint Committee, such studies, information, analyses, reports, and assistance as the committee may request. (Sec. 405) Directs the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration and the House Committee on Rules to review the operation of the procedures established by this Act, and to submit a report not later than December 31, 2002, and each five years thereafter, setting forth their findings and recommendations."
