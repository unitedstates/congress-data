    "text": "Amends Federal transportation law to require foreign air carriers to transmit to the Secretary of Transportation and the Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board a plan for addressing the needs of families of passengers involved in aircraft accidents involving foreign air carriers and a significant loss of life. Requires such a plan to include: (1) publicizing a reliable, toll-free telephone number and staff to take calls from families of passengers involved in such an accident; (2) a process for notifying such families as soon as possible, and in person to the extent practicable, before providing any public notice of the passengers' names; (3) an assurance that each passenger's family will be consulted about the disposition of any remains and personal effects (including return to the family) within the foreign air carrier's control; (4) an assurance of retention by the foreign air carrier of unclaimed possessions for at least 18 months; and (5) an assurance of other specified services. Makes inclusion of such a plan in the application for a foreign air transportation permit, or request for exemption from the requirement of a permit, a condition for approval. Declares that a foreign air carrier shall not be liable for damages in any action brought in a Federal or State court arising out of the foreign air carrier's performance in preparing or providing a passenger list pursuant to such a plan, unless the liability was caused by any conduct of the carrier which was grossly negligent or which constituted intentional misconduct."
