Permits a political subdivision: (1) notwithstanding such limitation or prohibition, to permit incinerators or landfills located in the subdivision to receive such waste; and (2) in the absence of such a limitation or prohibition, to impose a limitation or prohibition on the receipt of such waste by incinerators or landfills in the subdivision. Exempts the following from this Act's authorities: (1) solid waste identified as a hazardous waste under the SWDA; (2) solid waste resulting from a response action under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act or a comparable State law or from a corrective action under the SWDA; (3) recyclable materials that have been separated from waste destined for disposal; (4) materials and products returned from a dispenser or distributor to the manufacturer for credit, evaluation, and possible reuse; (5) specified solid waste that is generated by an industrial facility and is transported to a facility affiliated with the generator for purposes of treatment, storage, or disposal; and (6) medical waste that is not mixed with other solid waste."
