    "text": "Amends the National School Lunch Act with respect to the summer food service program to revise program eligibility criteria for a private nonprofit institution to: (1) increase from five to 25 the number of sites it may operate; and (2) eliminate requirements that it limit to 2,500 the total number of children served per day at all its sites, use its own facilities to prepare meals or obtain meals from a public facility or school participating in the school lunch program, and meet a March 1 deadline for indication of interest. Revises program requirements for food service management companies to: (1) allow private nonprofit organizations to contract with such companies; (2) make discretionary certain components of State registration and review; and (3) eliminate certain recordkeeping duties of the Secretary of Agriculture with respect to such companies that have been seriously deficient in program participation. Extends through FY 2003 the authorization of appropriations for the summer food service program."
