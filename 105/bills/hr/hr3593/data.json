    "text": "Department of Energy Small Business and Industry Partnership Enhancement Act of 1998 - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to direct the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to make arrangements for the conduct of technology research and development activities within the mission of the Department of Energy (DOE). Revises NRC authority to conduct research and development activities and studies for others in its own contractor-operated facilities where private facilities are inadequate for the purposes. Prohibits the Secretary of Energy, when conducting such activities for others, from recovering more than the full cost of work incurred at DOE contractor-operated facilities. Declares that any costs incurred by DOE in connection with work performed by contractor-operated DOE facilities shall be funded from DOE departmental administration accounts. Prescribes guidelines for charges a DOE contractor-operated facility may assess for work performed for a non-DOE entity (external customer). Requires the Secretary and each contractor operating a DOE facility to develop jointly a system of measurements (metrics) to determine levels of specific areas of performance, which shall subsequently be specified in the contract for operation of a contractor-operated facility, and which shall be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the facility's partnership development. Instructs the Secretary to encourage partnerships and interactions with universities and private industry at each contractor-operated facility. Makes development and expansion of partnerships and interactions with universities and private industry a component in evaluating the annual performance of each contractor-operated facility. Requires each contractor operating a DOE facility to create a small business technology partnership program at each such facility. Requires the Secretary to evaluate program effectiveness annually with each contractor to ensure opportunities for small businesses to interact with and use the resources of each contractor-operated facility. Requires the use of program funds to cover a contractor-operated facility's costs of interactions with small businesses. Prohibits the use of such funds for direct monetary grants to small businesses."
