Authorizes separate appropriations for such period for grants to States for specified child care activities in geographic areas with child care supply shortages. Authorizes appropriations in a specified amount to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for FY 1997 through 2002 to award grants to States for providing child care services for families who have left the State program of assistance under part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) of title IV of the Social Security Act because of employment, families that are at risk of becoming dependent on such assistance program, and low-income working families. Requires States and the Secretary to report on access to child care by low-income working families."
