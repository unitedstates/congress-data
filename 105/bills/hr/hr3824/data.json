Declares that regulations issued under such Act by the National Institute of Standards and Technology on April 14, 1998 (including any other regulations issued by them), shall not take effect until after the later of June 1, 1999, or 120 days after the Secretary of Commerce reports to specified congressional committees on: (1) changes in fastener manufacturing processes that have occurred since enactment of the Act; (2) a comparison of the Act to other regulatory programs that regulate the various categories of fasteners, and an analysis of any duplication that exists among programs; and (3) any further revisions to the Act that may be warranted because of such reported changes."
