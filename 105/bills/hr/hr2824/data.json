Provides that the maximum percentage allowable for a year is the percentage by which benefits under title II (Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act are increased (if at all) effective December 1 of the preceding year pursuant to a cost-of-living or general benefit increase. Bars annual pay increases for Members of Congress for a calendar year if the Director of the Congressional Budget Office determines that there was a deficit in the U.S. Government budget for the last fiscal year ending before the start of such calendar year."
