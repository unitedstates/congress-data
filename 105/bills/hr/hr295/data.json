Provides for the tax-exempt treatment of any private activity bond issued by an Indian tribal government or subdivision as a qualified bond. Prescribes specific ownership restrictions and an employment test. Exempts from the exclusion any bond issued by such tribal government or subdivision unless it is federally guaranteed.
