Requires the official responsible for the invalidated program to determine on a case-by-case basis which individuals qualify, according to specified low-opportunity circumstances, and not as members of a group, to be individuals of special achievement who have overcome particularly high obstacles to achieve the qualifications relevant for the position or benefit being sought."
