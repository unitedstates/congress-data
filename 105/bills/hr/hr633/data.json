Replaces the current rate for both employee and agency contributions to the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability (FSRD) Fund applicable to special agents with the same rate applicable to Federal law enforcement officers. Subjects to the percentages required for law enforcement officers any special contribution a special agent may make for prior service as a special agent. Revises the computation of annuities for special agents to apply the formula for law enforcement officers under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). Allows any special agent who elected to transfer from the FSRD System to the Foreign Service Pension System to have the portion of his or her annuity attributable to service preceding such election (including service as a Federal law enforcement officer or as a member of the Capitol Police) also computed according to the formula for law enforcement officers under CSRS. Subjects special agents who make an election under this Act to mandatory retirement at age 57 or, if older, after 20 years of service. Allows current participants, certain retirees, and participants' survivors to make specified elections concerning the applicability of amendments made by this Act."
