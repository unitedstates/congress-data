Requires each such manufacturer to make specified annual reductions in child tobacco use and provides penalties based upon total consumer use for failure to meet such requirements (with reductions for near compliance). Sets forth performance standards for new manufacturers. Directs that specified amounts of fiscal year penalties shall go to a Tobacco Enforcement and Education Fund in the Treasury, with any excess to go to the Treasury. Sets forth judicial review provisions."
