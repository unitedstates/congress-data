Requires that, in addition to any reports required to be filed by a principal campaign committee in accordance with FECA requirements, any person who first makes independent expenditures with respect to an election in an aggregate amount or value in excess of $1,000 after the deadline for filing a pre-election report shall file a report containing the information described under FECA at the time the person makes independent expenditures in such aggregate amount or value. Defines the term \"independent expenditure\" for the purposes of the reports requirement. Redefines the requirement for every person (other than a political committee) to report any independent expenditure aggregating $1,000 or more during a specified period before any election to require that the report include the identification of each person who made a contribution to the person filing such report which was in excess of $200 and was made for the purpose of furthering an independent expenditure."
