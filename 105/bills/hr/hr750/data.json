Directs the Secretary of State to include in each annual report to the Congress on conditions in Hong Kong, among other things, assessments of: (1) Hong Kong's or China's cooperation in securing certain agreements with the United States; and (2) the autonomy of Hong Kong and its customs territory (including any unprecedented diversion of Chinese exports through Hong Kong in order to attain preferential treatment in U.S. markets). Authorizes extension of the International Organizations Immunities Act to the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices (Hong Kong's official economic and trade missions in the United States) in the same manner as such Act may be extended to a public international organization in which the United States participates pursuant to any treaty or Act of the Congress. Authorizes the President to apply to such Offices certain provisions of the Agreement on State and Local Taxation of Foreign Employees of Public International Organizations."
