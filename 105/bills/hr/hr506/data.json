    "text": "Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) to add a new title, Title V - Public Funding for House of Representatives Elections. Prohibits qualifying House candidates from accepting contributions that total more than $100 per individual per election cycle. Requires, with respect to each reporting period for an election, that at least 80 percent of the total contributions accepted by a qualifying House candidate shall be from the State in which the congressional district involved is located. Sets forth the uses of public funds by qualifying House candidates. Prohibits a qualifying House candidate from using public funds to pay himself or herself a salary or personal mortgages. Directs the Federal Election Commission to make disbursements of public funds upon submission of evidence that an eligible expense has been incurred, except for an expense incurred more than four months before the election involved. Limits the maximum amount of public funding a qualifying House candidate may receive to $750,000. Requires that the amount shall be increased at the beginning of each even-numbered year, based on the increase in the price index, except that the base period shall be in 1995. Requires that a qualifying House candidate shall participate in at least two televised debates, organized by a bipartisan or nonpartisan group, in the congressional district media market. Sets forth requirements for acceptance of advertising by radio and television stations. (Sec. 2) Prohibits a national committee of a political party, including the national congressional campaign committees of a political party, and any officers and agents of such party committees, from soliciting or receiving any contributions, donations, or transfers of funds, or spending any funds, not subject to certain limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements of this Act. Applies the prohibition to entities established, financed, maintained, or controlled by a national committee of a political party, subject to an exception. (Sec. 3) Requires that any amount expended or disbursed by a State, district, or local committee of a political party, during a calendar year in which a Federal election is held, for any activity which might affect the outcome of a Federal election, including but not limited to any voter registration and get-out-the-vote activity, generic campaign activity, and any communication that identifies a Federal candidate (regardless of whether a State or local candidate is also mentioned or identified) shall be made from funds subject to certain limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements of this Act. Requires that any amount spent by a national, State, district or local committee or entity of a political party to raise funds that are used, in whole or in part, to pay the costs of any specified activity shall be made from funds subject to limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements. Applies the requirement to any entity that is established, financed, maintained, or controlled by a State, district, or local committee of a political party or any agent or officer of such party committee. (Sec. 4) Prohibits a national, State, district or local committee of a political party from soliciting any funds for or to make any donations to any organization that is exempt from Federal taxation under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. (Sec. 5) Prohibits a candidate for Federal office, an individual holding Federal office, or any agent of such candidate or officeholder from soliciting or receiving any funds in connection with any Federal election unless such funds are subject to the limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements of this Act, with the exception of the solicitation or receipt of funds by an individual who is a candidate for a non-Federal office if such activity is permitted under State law for such individual's non-Federal campaign committee. (Sec. 6) Amends FECA to revise reporting requirements. (Sec. 7) Requires that if any person other than a political party makes (or obligates to make) disbursements for specified activities in excess of $2,000, such person shall file a specified statement. (Sec. 8) Revises provisions concerning contributions made through intermediaries or conduits."
