Grants immunity from suits to persons subjected to legal proceedings for relief of any kind under Federal or State antitrust laws on account of being involved in the planning, issuance, or payment of such annuities or remainder trusts. Presumes that annuities or trusts treated as charitable gift annuities or remainder trusts in filings with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or in written documents provided by or on behalf of the donee to the donor are charitable gift annuities or remainder trusts unless the IRS has made a final determination, for fraud or otherwise, that an annuity or trust did not qualify as such. Makes immunity from antitrust laws under this Act inapplicable with respect to enforcement of a State law pertaining to such annuities or trusts created after the State enacts a statute, no later than December 8, 1998, that provides that such immunity is inapplicable. Applies this Act retroactively to conduct occurring before, and administrative and judicial actions pending on, the enactment date. Requires the Attorney General to carry out a study and report to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees on this Act's effect on markets for noncharitable annuities and charitable gift annuities and remainder trusts."
