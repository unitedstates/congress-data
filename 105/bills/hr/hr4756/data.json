(Sec. 4) Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the President should aggressively promote Year 2000 date change awareness for information technology systems and sensitive infrastructure applications; (2) the President should authorize the Chair of the Year 2000 Conversion Council to take a leadership role in resolving Year 2000 (Y2K) issues of any critical Federal agency system that is in jeopardy of not meeting the January 1, 2000 deadline; (3) the Chair should work toward a national strategy to assure that the critical infrastructures and key sectors of the economy will be prepared for the Year 2000 date change; (4) the Chair is making a significant contribution to Y2K problem awareness by scheduling a National Y2K Action Week for October 19 through 23, 1998; (5) the Small Business Administration (SBA), the Department of Commerce, the Department of Agriculture, and other Federal agencies should undertake maximum efforts to assist American family businesses and farmers in assessing their exposure to the Y2K problem, undertaking necessary remedial steps, and formulating contingency plans; and (6) State and local governments, as well as private sector industry groups and companies, should participate in the effort to prepare the American economy for the year 2000. (Sec. 5) Provides for all Federal agency reports to OMB relating to the Y2K problem to be concurrently transmitted to the Congress, including all agency monthly submissions to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). (Sec. 6) Directs the Chair to develop guidelines of best practices and standards for remediation and validation with respect to the Y2K problem to provide better direction for government and private sector efforts. (Sec. 7) Requires the Chair to submit to the Congress any national assessment of the Y2K problem conducted through or in conjunction with the Council covering all critical national infrastructures and key sectors of the economy. (Sec. 8) Requires the head of each Federal agency to ensure that all systems and hardware administered by the agency are Year 2000 compliant to ensure that no significant disruption of the agency's operations or data exchange partners occurs. Requires quarterly progress implementation reports to the Congress. (Sec. 9) Directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology, in conjunction with the SBA, to develop a Year 2000 compliance outreach program to assist small and medium-sized businesses with respect to the Y2K problem. (Sec. 10) Directs the Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology to develop a Year 2000 consumer awareness program to assist the public in becoming aware of the implications of the Y2K problem."
