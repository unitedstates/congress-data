    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Improving Regulation of Drugs Title II: Improving Regulation of Devices Title III: Improving Regulation of Food Food and Drug Administration Regulatory Modernization Act of 1997 - Title I: Improving Regulation of Drugs - Amends Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) provisions regarding fees relating to drugs to revise and add various definitions. Makes the fee (currently, 50 percent of the fee) for human drug applications or supplements due on submission. Mandates a refund of 75 (currently, 50) percent if the application or supplement is refused for filing. Exempts from the fee: (1) an application for a drug for a rare condition (orphan drug) or a supplement proposing a new indication for a rare condition; and (2) supplements for indications for use in pediatric populations. Allows fee refund if an application or supplement is withdrawn. Modifies requirements regarding: (1) the annual prescription drug establishment fee; (2) the prescription drug product fee; (3) fee amounts; (4) fee adjustments; (5) fee waiver or reduction; (6) assessment of fees; and (7) crediting and availability of fees (including authorizing appropriations). Terminates, on specified dates, the effectiveness of the amendments made by this paragraph. (Sec. 102) Allows for additional deferred effective dates for the approval of certain new drug applications to allow for additional pediatric information developed by further studies. Mandates development, prioritization, publication, and annual updating of a list of approved drugs for which additional pediatric information may produce health benefits in the pediatric population. Prohibits granting a period of market exclusivity under these provisions after a specified date. (Sec. 103) Directs the Secretary to facilitate development and expedite review of new drugs intended for serious conditions and demonstrating the potential to address unmet medical needs for those conditions. Terms such products \"fast track products.\" Sets forth designation requirements and procedures. (Sec. 104) Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to authorize the shipment of investigational drugs for the diagnosis or treatment of a serious disease or condition in emergency situations. Authorizes any person, through a licensed physician, to request, and any manufacturer or distributor to provide to the physician, such a drug if specified requirements are met. Directs the Secretary, after submission of a protocol intended to provide widespread access, to permit expanded access under a treatment investigational new drug (IND) application if certain requirements are met. (Sec. 105) Amends the Public Health Service Act to mandate a program in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) regarding information on research relating to the treatment, detection, and prevention of serious conditions, including establishing, and disseminating information from, a data bank of information on clinical trials for related drugs and biologicals. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 106) Amends the FDCA to allow a manufacturer, in certain circumstances, to disseminate to health care practitioners, pharmacy benefit managers, health insurance insurers, group health plans, or government agencies certain information on the safety, effectiveness, or benefit of a use not described in the approved labeling of a drug if the manufacturer meets certain requirements. Allows the Secretary, on ordering a manufacturer to cease dissemination, to order the manufacturer to correct information that has been disseminated. Makes failure to comply with this section a prohibited act. Terminates the effectiveness of the amendments made by this section on a specified date. (Sec. 107) Mandates a study and report to specified congressional committees by the Comptroller General regarding the impact of, and the scientific issues raised by, section 106. (Sec. 108) Mandates: (1) performance standards for the prompt review of supplemental applications for approved drugs; (2) final guidances regarding the approval of such supplemental applications; (3) designation of an individual in each FDA center to encourage prompt review and work with sponsors to facilitate the development and submission of data to support such applications; and (4) programs and policies to foster collaboration between the FDA, the NIH, professional medical and scientific societies, and other persons regarding such applications. (Sec. 109) Prohibits considering health care economic information provided to a formulary committee or similar entity false or misleading if the information directly relates to an indication approved under specified provisions of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) for that drug and is based on competent and reliable scientific evidence. Declares that the requirements of specified PHSA provisions do not apply to information provided under this paragraph. (Sec. 110) Declares that, if the Secretary determines that data from one clinical investigation and confirmatory evidence (obtained before or after the investigation) are sufficient to establish effectiveness, the Secretary may consider that data and evidence to constitute substantial evidence. Amends the PHSA to mandate development of guidance on the inclusion of women and minorities in clinical trials. (Sec. 111) Amends the FDCA to regulate new drug manufacturing changes, including requiring manufacturer validation of the effects of the change and setting forth separate requirements for major and non-major changes. (Sec. 112) Allows a new drug clinical investigation to begin 30 days after specified materials have been submitted to the Secretary unless the Secretary prohibits conducting the investigation. (Sec. 113) Mandates guidance that describes when abbreviated study reports may be submitted in lieu of full reports with a new drug application and with a biologics license application. (Sec. 114) Modifies new drug requirements regarding: (1) application contents and review; and (2) the use of scientific advisory panels. (Sec. 116) Directs the Secretary, if there is a scientific controversy between the Secretary and a sponsor, applicant, or manufacturer and no specific FDCA provision or regulation provides a right of review, to establish by regulation a procedure under which that party may request a review of the controversy by a scientific advisory panel. (Sec. 117) Regulates the development, availability, and effect of guidance documents. (Sec. 118) Declares a compounded positron emission tomography drug adulterated if it does not conform to the compounding standards and the official monographs of the United States Pharmacopoeia (but sets expiration dates for this provision). Mandates procedures for the approval of, and good manufacturing practice requirements regarding, such drugs. Exempts, until specified dates, such drugs (if not adulterated) from new drug and abbreviated new drug approval requirements. Mandates termination of specified related notices and a related rule. (Sec. 119) Mandates regulations regarding the approval of radiopharmaceuticals designed for diagnosis and monitoring of diseases and conditions. (Sec. 120) Amends the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) to revise requirements regarding: (1) introducing biological products into interstate commerce, including related license approval and labeling requirements; and (2) inspection of biological product facilities. Modifies requirements regarding the certification of clinical laboratories. (Sec. 121) Amends the FDCA to allow a pilot or other small facility to be used to demonstrate drug or animal drug safety and effectiveness. (Sec. 122) Repeals provisions relating to the certification of drugs containing insulin or antibiotics. Allows insulin and antibiotic exports without regard to certain requirements. Declares that the antibiotic provision repeal does not apply to drugs that contain antibiotic drug ingredients that had approved or pending applications before enactment of this Act. (Sec. 123) Sets forth an FDA mission statement. Mandates an annual report to specified congressional committees regarding FDA performance, staffing, and resources and listing bilateral and multinational meetings held by the FDA to reduce regulatory burdens, harmonize regulation, and seek reciprocal arrangements. (Sec. 124) Mandates an information system to track applications and submissions to the FDA. (Sec. 125) Mandates training for FDA employees on FDCA regulations and policies. (Sec. 126) Mandates a demonstration program of grants for centers to conduct research regarding specified aspects of drugs. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 127) Directs the Secretary to meet with representatives of other countries to discuss regulatory requirement harmonization.
