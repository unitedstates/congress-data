    "text": "Higher Education for the Twenty-First Century Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to establish programs for postsecondary education opportunities for Hispanic students and other student populations underrepresented in postsecondary education. (Sec. 2) Amends HEA to provide for institutional aid to Hispanic-Serving Institutions. Defines Hispanic-serving institution as an eligible institution with an undergraduate full-time equivalent enrollment that is at least 25 percent Hispanic, and that provides assurance that at least 50 percent of its Hispanic students are low-income individuals. Directs the Secretary of Education to provide grants and related assistance to: (1) Hispanic-serving institutions to improve and expand their capacity to serve Hispanic students and other low-income individuals; and (2) Hispanic-serving institutions with graduate and professional programs to improve and expand graduate and professional opportunities for Hispanic students and other students underrepresented in graduate education. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary to make grants to American Indian tribal colleges and universities for specified authorized uses. (Sec. 4) Prescribes additional considerations for the making of grants and contracts under Federal TRIO programs (various programs of outreach to qualified individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds). (Sec. 5) Revises the HEA campus-based student assistance programs allocation formula with respect to allocation of additional appropriations. (Such formula applies to the programs of: (1) Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants; (2) College Work-Study; and (3) Federal Perkins, or direct, Loans.) (Sec. 6) Revises special student assistance programs for students whose families are engaged in migrant and seasonal farmwork. Directs the Secretary, in making grants for such programs, to consider the project's coordination with other local, State, and Federal programs that provide health and education services for migrant students. Directs the Secretary to: (1) develop and conduct a longitudinal study of the educational attainment of migrant students and the health and education needs of such students; and (2) collect data on migrant students in any case where data on students is collected on a racial or ethnic basis. Directs the Assistant Secretary for Educational Research and Improvement, through the National Center for Education Statistics, to collect certain data, including postsecondary education data, on migrant students. Authorizes appropriations for such special programs for migrant students. Authorizes the Secretary, when appropriations for the high school equivalency and college assistance migrant programs exceed specified levels, to make grants to otherwise eligible Hispanic-serving or historically Black institutions that have enrolled at least 30 first-year migrant students. (Sec. 7) Gives Hispanic-serving institutions a temporary exemption from certain default rate limitations on eligibility under the Federal guaranteed student loan program. (Sec. 8) Directs the Secretary to cancel specified portions of a borrower's Federal guaranteed and direct student loan liability in return for certain types of teaching and other public service by the borrower. (Sec. 9) Revises requirements for grants for College Work-Study programs to require a 100 percent Federal share of compensation for work-study students who tutor students eligible for and receiving services under the high school equivalency and college assistance migrant student programs. (Sec. 10) Revises and renames HEA title V as Programs for Teaching and Counseling Excellence (currently Educator Recruitment, Retention, and Development). Establishes a new Teacher Education and Professional Development program. Directs the Secretary to award grants to institutions of higher education and consortia of such institutions and local educational agencies, for one or more of the following uses: (1) technology training for elementary and secondary school teachers and counselors; (2) training of bilingual education teachers; (3) recruitment of minorities into the teaching and counseling professions; and (4) training of elementary and secondary school teachers in methodology to raise the academic achievement for all students. Gives an applicant priority if it is a consortium of an institution of higher education and a local educational agency. Authorizes appropriations. Establishes new Programs for Counseling Excellence (which revises certain requirements for Model Program Community Partnership and Counseling Grants). Directs the Secretary to award grants to develop model programs for counseling excellence. Adds in-service training for guidance counselors to the current uses of such grants for student counseling programs and community partnerships for tutoring and mentoring. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 11) Directs the Secretary to give priority in funding to graduate program grant applicants that provide programs enrolling students who are underrepresented in graduate and professional programs, and that recruit such students from historically Black, Hispanic-serving, and American Indian Tribal colleges and universities. (Sec. 12) Revises Postsecondary Improvement Programs to add to the authorized uses of Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education grants the development of innovative methods for ensuring the successful transfer of students from two-year to four-year institutions."
