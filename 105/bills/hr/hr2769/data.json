Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) provide to each licensed dealer and cause to have published in the Federal Register a list of chief law enforcement officers certified as cooperating; and (2) periodically publish in the Federal Register and provide to such dealers a list of officers previously certified whom the Secretary determines are no longer the head of a cooperating law enforcement agency. Authorizes a chief law enforcement officer, in the absence of an express provision of State law that prohibits a State or local law enforcement officer from conducting a background check on a handgun purchaser, to make a reasonable effort to ascertain, within five business days after receipt of a notice of the contents of a transferee's statement, whether receipt or possession of the handgun involved would violate the law."
