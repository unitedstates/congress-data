Makes such penalties payable to the administrator of the universal service support program for use only in providing such support for schools, libraries, and health care providers. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to direct the Federal Communications Commission to: (1) require telecommunications carriers to report regularly on each incident of which such carriers have knowledge or have received a complaint of a change in a subscriber's selection of a telephone exchange or toll service without the subscriber's authorization; and (2) make bona fide efforts to enter into agreements with State commissions concerning reciprocal reporting of such incidents."
