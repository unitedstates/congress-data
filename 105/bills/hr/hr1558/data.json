    "text": "Hansen's Disease Program Amendments of 1997 - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide for the relocation of the Gillis W. Long Hansen's Disease Center near Carville, Louisiana, and to transfer to Louisiana the real property and improvements constituting the Center. Provides transfer conditions, including the requirement that the property and improvements be used for the next 30-year period exclusively for promoting public health or education. Provides employee pay and retirement considerations for Federal employees of the Center who become State employees at the transferred property. Requires the Center's relocation site to be in the Baton Rouge area and to continue to use the same name. Provides care and treatment options of patients at the relocated Center. Amends the Public Health Service Act to prohibit the Secretary from providing long-term care at the relocated Center for patients suffering from Hansen's disease (a form of leprosy) or its complications. Directs the Center to conduct training in the diagnosis and management of the disease and to conduct and promote the coordination of research, investigations, demonstrations, and studies relating to the causes, diagnosis, treatment, control, and prevention of that disease as well as other mycobacterial diseases and complications related to such disease. Authorizes the Secretary to establish sites for the treatment of persons with Hansen's disease, requiring each site to provide for appropriate outpatient care and treatment."
