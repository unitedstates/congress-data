    "text": "Savings Provision Technical Amendment Act of 1998 - Amends the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 relating to information technology management to make certain savings provisions inapplicable to any decision of the General Services Board of Contract Appeals (whether or not such decision is subsequently vacated) that: (1) is issued in a proceeding involving a protest; (2) is issued after February 10, 1996, and before the effective date of such Act; and (3) declares that a delegation of procurement authority from the Administrator of General Services or another source should have been obtained, and that a contract is void for lack of such a delegation. Declares that, in the case of any decision of the Board covered by this Act, the Administrator: (1) shall take necessary actions to vacate the decision; and (2) may not decide any further protest with respect to the contract it declared void. Requires the contracting activity that awarded the contract that was declared void by such decision to: (1) deem the contract valid and in full effect; (2) adhere to the contract's terms; and (3) require performance of the contract to begin 15 days after enactment of this Act and continue for the number of years prescribed by the contract when awarded. States that the contract declared void by such decision shall not be subject to any other protest."
