Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to assess a civil penalty for each day of violation. Sets forth abandoned vessels' removal procedures, and liability guidelines for vessel removal contractors. Declares that this Act does not preempt State or local laws that either provide greater protection against abandonment, or better ensure such vessels' removal. Authorizes appropriations."
