Defines: (1) \"qualifying contribution\"; and (2) \"seed money contribution.\" Sets forth requirements applicable to clean money candidates regarding: (1) contributions and expenditures; and (2) use of personal funds. Directs the Federal Election Commission (Commission) to: (1) determine whether the candidate meets the eligibility requirements; and (2) certify whether or not the candidate is a clean money candidate. Establishes in the Treasury a House of Representatives Election Fund for the Commission to deposit unspent seed money contributions, qualifying contributions, penalty amounts, and amounts appropriated for clean money financing. Requires the Commission to assess a certain civil penalty against a clean money candidate when such candidate makes an expenditure from funds other than clean money funds. Authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary to carry out this title. (Sec. 103) Sets forth reporting requirements regarding certain expenditures of private money candidates. Title II: Independent Expenditures; Coordinated Political Party Expenditures - Sets forth requirements for reporting of certain independent expenditures. (Sec. 202) Redefines \"independent expenditure.\" (Sec. 203) Limits expenditures that may be made by political party committees in connection with the general election campaign of a House election in which one or more of the candidates is a clean money candidate. (Sec. 204) Requires a committee of a political party, before making coordinated expenditures (as defined in this Act) in excess of $5000 for a Federal election, to certify to the Commission that it has not and will not make any independent expenditures (as defined in this Act) in connection with such campaign. Prohibits a party committee that determines to make coordinated expenditures to, or receive any transfer of funds in the same election cycle from, any other party committee that determines to make independent expenditures in connection with the same campaign for Federal office. Title III: Voter Information - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to entitle clean money candidates to receive specified free broadcast time. (Sec. 302) Allows clean money candidates to receive certain broadcast media rates for use of a television broadcasting station. Prohibits preemption except under circumstances beyond a station's control. (Sec. 303) Amends FECA to revise requirements regarding the publication and distribution of statements and solicitations, including applying the requirements to political committees (currently applies to any person). Sets forth political advertising provisions for print and broadcast or cablecast communications. Sets forth reporting requirements for issue advertisements. (Sec. 304) Amends Federal law to prohibit franked mass mailings by a Member in his or her election year, unless such Member will not be a candidate for any Federal office, with an exception. Title IV: Soft Money of Political Party Committees - Amends FECA with respect to \"soft money\" to: (1) prohibit a national committee of a political party (including a national congressional campaign committee of a political party but not including a State, district, or local committee of a political party) from soliciting or receiving contributions or making expenditures not subject to such Act; (2) require a State, district, or local committee of a political party to make Federal election year expenditures (with exceptions) from funds subject to such Act; (3) prohibit a national, State, district, or local committee from soliciting or donating funds to a tax-exempt organization; and (4) prohibit an incumbent or candidate for Federal office or agent of a candidate or incumbent from soliciting or receiving funds not subject to such Act, or to solicit or receive funds for a non-Federal election in excess of certain limits or from prohibited sources (with exceptions for State or local candidates in compliance with State law). (Sec. 402) Establishes aggregate and separate individual contribution limits to State Party Grassroots Funds and all committees established by a State committee of a political party. Increases annual individual contribution limits. Sets forth State Party Grassroots Fund and reporting provisions. Eliminates the exception for building funds relating to the definition of the term \"contribution.\" Authorizes the filing of State reports by State committees. Requires the reporting of all disbursements made by authorized committees. Revises requirements for the reporting of the names and addresses of persons to whom certain expenditures are made to meet candidate or committee operating expenses, to require the reporting of the election to which the operating expenditure relates. Title V: Restructuring and Strengthening of the Federal Election Commission - Revises requirements for the composition and terms of Commissioners and replaces them with new requirements, including to require that Commissioners serve no more than one term of six years. Authorizes the Commission to: (1) conduct random post election audits to ensure voluntary FECA compliance; and (2) seek injunctions; (3) expedite Commission procedures for certain complaints; and (4) prescribe regulations for computer and facsimile reporting.
