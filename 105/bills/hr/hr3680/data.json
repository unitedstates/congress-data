    "text": "English Language Fluency Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to establish a program to help children and youth learn English under title VII, changing its from Bilingual Education, Language Enhancement, and Language Acquisition Programs to English Language Fluency and Foreign Language Acquisition Programs. Requires that parents be given: (1) notification of a child's identification as needing English language instruction; (2) the right to consent, or not, to the child's participation in such program; and (3) program information and notice of opportunities for regular meetings to formulate and get responses to their recommendations. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary of Education to reserve a specified portion of such appropriations for specified entities serving Native American or Alaska Native children and youth at elementary, secondary, and postsecondary school levels. Directs the Secretary to make English language acquisition formula grants to States for: (1) subgrants to eligible entities to provide assistance to children and youth who are English language learners, as well as immigrant children and youth; and (2) professional development and personnel certification, technical assistance to local educational agencies, planning, administration, and interagency coordination. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed as requiring a State or a local educational agency to establish or continue a program of native language instruction. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct, through the Office of Educational Research and Improvement, research to improve English language instruction for children and youth who are English language learners and immigrant children and youth. Limits such research- related activities to: (1) identification of successful models for teaching children English; and (2) distribution of research results to States for dissemination to schools with populations of students who are English language learners. Prohibits such research from focussing on any one method of instruction. (Sec. 2) Repeals authority for the Emergency Immigrant Education Program. (Sec. 3) Revises ESEA title VII administrative coordination and reporting requirements. Provides for commingling of different ESEA funds. Repeals certain provisions relating to release time, education technology, notification of State agencies, and continued eligibility of entities receiving funds. (Sec. 4) Declares that nothing under ESEA title VII shall be construed to negate or supersede the legal authority under State law of State agencies, State entities, or State public officials over programs that are under their jurisdiction."
