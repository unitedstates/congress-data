    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Technical Amendments Title I: Cost of Higher Education Review Title I: Technical Amendments - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to make certain technical corrections relating to graduation rates data disclosures. Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to extend from January 1, 1998, to January 1, 1999, the deadline for a final report by the Secretary of Education on a national assessment of programs assisted under ESEA title I, Helping Disadvantaged Children Meet High Standards. Directs the Secretary to deem Kansas and New Mexico as having timely submitted certain written notices of intent to consider specified impact aid payments under ESEA in providing State aid to local educational agencies (LEAs) for school year 1997-1998. Authorizes the Secretary to require these States to submit appropriate additional information, which shall be considered part of such notice. Provides that no eligible LEA shall receive less than 85 percent of the FY 1996 amount in a specified hold-harmless impact aid payment for each of FY 1997 through 2000. Revises requirements for the Secretary's use of data in providing additional assistance for heavily impacted LEAs, to specify that the student and revenue data used be expenditure data. Repeals the requirement that the Secretary use the most recent data available adjusted to the fiscal year in question. Amends ESEA with respect to Federal impact aid payments to prescribe priorities for payments (in excess of FY 1996 payments) to an LEA that: (1) received an impact payment in FY 1996; (2) serves a school district in which at least 60 percent of the real property is federally owned, including all or a portion of a U.S. military academy; and (3) whose per-pupil revenue from local sources for current expenditures is not less than the revenue for the preceding fiscal year. Title II: Cost of Higher Education Review - Cost of Higher Education Review Act of 1997 - Establishes a National Commission on the Cost of Higher Education to study and make recommendations to the President and the Congress regarding: (1) the increase in tuition compared with other commodities and services; (2) innovative methods of reducing or stabilizing tuition; (3) the impact on tuition of specified trends in college and university costs, student financial aid, and government mandates and fiscal policies; (4) mechanisms for a more timely and widespread distribution of data on tuition trends and other costs of operating colleges and universities; and (5) the adequacy of existing Federal and State financial aid programs in meeting the costs of attending colleges and universities. Authorizes appropriations."
