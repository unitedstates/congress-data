Directs the Comptroller General to report on the most efficient means of abolishing the DOC, and transferring or terminating its functions. Title II: Disposition of Particular Programs, Functions, and Agencies of Department of Commerce - Repeals the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 and transfers all financial obligations, liabilities, and related rights owned by DOC under such Act to the Department of the Treasury. Requires an audit by the Comptroller General of all DOC grants made under such Act in FY 1995. (Sec. 202) Transfers all export control functions of the DOC under the Export Administration Act of 1979 to the Secretary of State, the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Attorney General. Authorizes transfer of a limited number of specified DOC special agents to the Customs Service. Abolishes the Office of Foreign Availability and the Office of the Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration, and provides for the appointment of an Industries Board to advise the Secretary of State. (Sec. 203) Transfers specified national security functions: (1) granted by the Trade Expansion Act to the International Trade Commission (ITC); and (2) granted by the Defense Production Act to the Secretaries of Defense and of the Treasury.
