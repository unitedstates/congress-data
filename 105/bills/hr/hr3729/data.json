Urges State Governors, State legislators, and State prison administrators to prohibit unsupervised access to the Internet by State prisoners. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) conduct a survey to determine to what extent each State allows prisoners access to an interactive computer service and whether such access is supervised by a prison official; and (2) report to the Congress."
