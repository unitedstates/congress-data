Authorizes the President to waive such prohibition if the importing country has similar or more stringent labeling or advertising requirements. Sets forth penalties. Prohibits the use of funds to: (1) affect restrictions imposed by foreign countries with respect to the sale of tobacco products; or (2) promote the export of such products in such country. Requires any interagency committee established to assist the United States Trade Representative in performing certain functions to include Department of Health and Human Services representatives with respect to any case involving specified tobacco products. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should urge the United Nations to create a UN Conference to address the use of tobacco worldwide and to implement regulations to decrease its use."
