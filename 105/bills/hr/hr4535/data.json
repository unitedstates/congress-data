Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to (temporarily) provide cost-share assistance for crop and livestock producers performing certain drought alleviation projects. Makes such assistance available retroactively to eligible projects begun as of January 1, 1998. Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to authorize: (1) emergency loans based upon estimated losses; and (2) emergency loan interest deferral."
