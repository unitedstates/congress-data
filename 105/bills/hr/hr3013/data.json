    "text": "Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to make grants to: (1) provide child protective workers and child welfare workers access to criminal conviction information and protection orders based on a claim of domestic or child abuse; or (2) improve law enforcement access to certain judicial orders (including custody, visitation, and protection orders). Modifies grant application guidelines to reflect such use of the grants. Prescribes grant eligibility guidelines for closed circuit televising of testimony of children who are victims of abuse. Allows drug control and system improvement (Byrne) grants to be used to enforce child abuse and neglect laws and programs designed to prevent child abuse and neglect. Amends the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 to increase the set aside for child abuse victims."
