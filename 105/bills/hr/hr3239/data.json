Directs Medicare+Choice organizations to report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services certain financial information, including an audited financial statement of the organization for the most recently concluded fiscal year. Provides for disclosure of the availability of such information to Medicare beneficiaries and prospective Medicare beneficiaries as part of the broad dissemination of information to promote an active, informed selection of the coverage options available under the available Medicare+Choice plans. Applies the requirements of this Act to eligible organizations with risk-sharing contracts under Medicare in the same manner that they apply to Medicare+Choice organizations."
