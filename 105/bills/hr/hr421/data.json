Varies the permissible frequency of such covered tests on the basis of a woman's age and her risk of developing breast cancer. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to periodically review and revise permissible frequencies of such tests. Makes such coverage mandatory. Prohibits imposition of charges against beneficiaries for such services. Provides for a 100 percent Federal match for screening mammography services."
