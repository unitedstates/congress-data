Requires that if a political committee is required to file reports electronically during an election cycle, the committee shall file a report listing each contribution of $100 or more received by the committee not later than ten days after receipt and include the contributor's identification, the date of receipt and the contribution amount, and (in the case of a candidate's authorized committee) the candidate's name and the office sought by the candidate. Expands the types of contributions required to be reported by principal campaign committees subject to the mandatory electronic reporting requirements under this Act and changes the deadline for reporting such contributions by any authorized committee of a candidate."
