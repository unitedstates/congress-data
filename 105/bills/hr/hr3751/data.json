Lists examples of conditions which are covered by such term. (Sec. 3) Voids specified regulations and opinion letters of the Secretary of Labor under FMLA on the effective date of new final regulations. Directs the Secretary to revise such regulations and issue new proposed and final regulations by certain deadlines. (Sec. 4) Revises requirements for FMLA leave taken intermittently or on a reduced leave scheduleor. Requires certification by the health care provider of the medical necessity of such leave. Authorizes employers to require: (1) an employee to take intermittent leave in increments of up to one-half of a work day; and (2) employees who travel as part of their normal day-to-day work or duty assignments to take leave for the duration of that work or assignment if the employer cannot reasonably accommodate the employee's request to take leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule. (Sec. 5) Authorizes an employer who does not exercise the right to substitute other employer-provided leave for FMLA leave to require an employee to request such leave in a timely manner. (Sec. 6) Authorizes an employer to require the employee to choose between FMLA unpaid leave and employer-provided paid absence. (Sec. 7) Requires documentation by objective medical findings of the appropriate medical facts for purposes of certification of a request for leave under FMLA."
