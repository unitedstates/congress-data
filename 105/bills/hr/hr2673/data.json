    "text": "Trigger Lock Act of 1997 - Prohibits the transfer of a firearm in the United States, in or affecting commerce, unless a locking device is attached to, or is an integral part of, the firearm. Sets penalties for private transfers and transfers by federally licensed firearms dealers and manufacturers. Prohibits and sets penalties for: (1) the manufacture of a handgun in the United States, in or affecting commerce, unless a locking device that meets specified minimum quality standards is attached to, or is an integral part of, the firearm; (2) the transfer by any licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer of a handgun that is not accompanied by a specified printed message regarding firearm safety and storage; and (3) leaving a loaded firearm, or an unloaded firearm and ammunition, with a minor unless the possession by the minor is supervised by an adult who is not prohibited from possessing a firearm. Directs the National Institute of Justice and the Consumer Product Safety Commission to each study and report to the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury on the feasibility of developing minimum quality standards for locking devices. Requires: (1) the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a study on the results of this Act and report to the Attorney General and the Secretary; and (2) the Secretary to issue final regulations which prescribe minimum quality standards for locking devices. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1998 to the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services who shall coordinate their expenditures for public service announcements and counter advertisements to educate the public on proper firearm storage."
