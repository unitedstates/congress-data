    "text": "(On June 25, 1998, the Supreme Court ruled that the Line Item Veto Act (Public Law 104-130) is unconstitutional, thus restoring provisions that had been cancelled as summarized below.) (On August 11, 1997, the President line-item-vetoed Sec. 4722(c), which deemed to be permissible broad-based health care related taxes certain taxes, fees, or assessments collected by New York State from a health care provider before June 1, 1997, for which a specified waiver has been applied, or would be but for this provision. The provision would thus exempt such taxes, fees, or assessments from the requirement that provider-specific taxes be subtracted from the State share of Medicaid expenditures for purposes of Federal share calculation. The following revised digest of H.R. 2015 reflects the Act as signed into law, minus the line-item-vetoed provision. For more information on the specific items vetoed, see the text of the conference report for H.R. 2015, H.Rept. 105-217, and Presidential Cancellation Number 97-3.)

Title III: Communications and Spectrum Allocation Provisions - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 (the Act) to make competitive bidding authority with respect to licenses or construction permits involving uses of the electromagnetic spectrum (spectrum) inapplicable to such licenses and permits issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that are for: (1) certain public safety radio services; (2) initial licenses or permits assigned to existing terrestrial broadcast licensees for digital television (TV) service; or (3) noncommercial educational or public broadcast stations. Requires the FCC to provide for the design and conduct of spectrum competitive bidding using a contingent combinatorial bidding system that permits prospective bidders to bid on combinations of licenses in a single bid and to enter multiple alternative bids within a single bidding round. Directs the FCC to prescribe methods by which a reasonable reserve price will be required, or a minimum bid will be established, to obtain any license or permit assigned under competitive bidding, unless determined not to be in the public interest. Repeals a requirement that any funds appropriated to the FCC for FY 1994 through 1998 for assigning licenses using random selection procedures be retained in the FCC's salaries and expenses account.

Requires the FCC to notify the Secretary of Commerce if it is unable to provide for effective relocation of incumbent licensees to available bands of frequencies and has identified bands suitable for such relocation that are allocated for Federal use but could be reallocated pursuant to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act (NTIA). Amends NTIA to direct the Secretary to report to the President, the FCC, and the Congress on recommendations for reallocating frequencies allocated for Federal use other than by Government licensees under the Communications Act of 1934. Authorizes any entity which operates a Government station to accept payment for frequency relocation expenses. Provides a relocation process triggered by a petition under NTIA. Allows a Federal entity to reclaim a former frequency if it demonstrates that relocated facilities or spectrum are not comparable to its former facilities or spectrum. Requires the Secretary to recommend for reallocation for use other than by Government stations a band of frequencies that: (1) in the aggregate span at least 20 mhz; (2) are located below three gigahertz; and (3) meet other relocation criteria.

Sets deadlines for the assignment of such licenses and the commencement of competitive bidding. Provides for the licensing of unused frequencies for public safety services. (Sec. 3005) Authorizes the FCC to allocate spectrum to provide flexibility of use, as long as such use is consistent with international agreements and upon a finding that such use is in the public interest and would not deter investment or result in harmful interference among users. (Sec. 3006) Authorizes appropriations to the FCC for FY 2001 for universal service support programs. (Sec. 3007) Directs the FCC to conduct all competitive bidding required under this title so that proceeds from such bidding are deposited no later than the end of FY 2002. (Sec. 3008) Requires seven days' public notice before the granting by the FCC of an application for spectrum frequency assignment under the Act.

Chapter 5: Tax Treatment of Hospitals Participating in Provider- Sponsored Organizations - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide that an organization shall not fail to be treated as a tax-exempt charitable organization solely because a hospital which it owns and operates also participates in a provider-sponsored organization, whether or not the provider-sponsored organization is exempt from tax. Provides that any person with a material financial interest in such a provider-sponsored organization shall be treated as a private shareholder or individual with respect to the hospital. Subtitle B: Prevention Initiatives - Outlines various specified new preventive health measures covered under Medicare, namely coverage for: (1) an annual screening mammography for women over age 39 and triennial screening pap smear and screening pelvic exam for any woman (annually for a woman with cervical or vaginal cancer or other abnormality, or who is at high risk of developing such a cancer), while providing for a waiver of deductible; (2) annual prostate cancer screening tests; (3) colorectal cancer screening tests, subject to prescribed frequency and payment limits; (4) diabetes outpatient self-management training services, including blood-testing strips (with a ten percent payment reduction after 1997) and glucose monitors as durable medical equipment (DME) for individuals with diabetes; and (5) bone mass measurements for qualified individuals.

Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress: (1) a detailed analysis of telemedicine and telehealth (T&T) services; and (2) an examination of the possibility of making similar payments for professional consultation via telecommunications systems to Medicare beneficiaries who do not reside in a rural health professional shortage area, are homebound or nursing homebound, and for whom being transferred for health care services imposes a serious hardship. (Sec. 4207) Directs the Secretary to conduct a demonstration project to use eligible health care provider telemedicine networks to apply high-capacity computing and advanced networks to improve primary care and prevent health care complications to Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes mellitus who reside in medically underserved rural or inner-city areas.

(Sec. 4304) Provides for the imposition of civil monetary penalties for: (1) any person who arranges or contracts with an individual or entity that the person knows or should know is excluded from participation in a Federal health care program; and (2) kickbacks. Chapter 2: Improvements in Protecting Program Integrity - Amends SSA title XVIII to require the Secretary, in the annual notice of Medicare benefits, to urge beneficiaries to check the notice and any itemized statement for accuracy and report any errors or questionable charges by calling a certain toll-free number.
