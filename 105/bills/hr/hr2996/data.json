States that such a combination is not conditioned upon the completion of any other acquisition transaction, in exchange for securities (or a combination or alternative offer of securities and cash), if the securities issued in the combination to the limited partners in the combining partnership or partnerships represent ten percent or less of a class of securities that is, or will be upon notice of issuance, listed on the New York Stock Exchange or American Stock Exchange or the National Market System of the Nasdaq Stock Market (or any successor to such entities) and are part of a class of securities so listed for a year or more."
