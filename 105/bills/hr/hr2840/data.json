Provides for each accounting statement submitted to: (1) cover, at a minimum, the costs and corresponding benefits for the five fiscal years preceding October 1 of the year in which the report is submitted; and (2) also contain a projection of the costs and corresponding benefits for the next ten fiscal years. Directs the President to propose the first accounting statement no later than one year after the enactment of this Act. Provides for such statement to cover, at a minimum, each of the preceding fiscal years beginning with FY 1997. Requires the President, acting through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in each year following the year in which the President submits an accounting statement and after notice and opportunity for comment, to submit to the Congress a report associated with the accounting statement containing: (1) analyses of impacts; (2) an analysis of jurisdictional overlaps, duplications, and potential inconsistencies among Federal regulatory programs; and (3) recommendations for reform. Requires the Director to: (1) provide guidance to agencies to standardize measures of costs and benefits in accounting statements and the format of the accounting statements; and (2) review submissions from agencies to assure consistency with the guidance. Directs the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, after each accounting statement and associated report is submitted to the Congress, to make recommendations to the President for improving accounting statements and associated reports."
