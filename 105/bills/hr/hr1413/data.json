Directs the University to use amounts received under the grant to conduct a study to assess biological markers, exposure to carcinogens, and other potential risk factors contributing to the incidence of breast cancer in New Jersey. Requires the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services to be the co-investigator with the University for any population based epidemiologic studies that attempt to explore associations between environmental and other risk factors and breast cancer. Mandates an annual report. Authorizes appropriations."
