    "text": "Bank Regulation Adjustment Act - Amends the Truth in Lending Act to establish a criminal penalty for specified activities pertaining to fraudulent use of credit cards, including obtaining a credit card by fraudulent means. Amends Federal monetary law to mandate annual inflation adjustments with respect to specified transactions for which a domestic financial institution is required to file currency transaction reports. Permits filers of infrequent currency transaction reports to file on a quarterly basis. Amends the Federal Reserve Act to repeal: (1) the \"due on demand\" requirement for \"insider loans\" to executive bank officers; (2) reporting requirements pertaining to such loans; and (3) the authority of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to assess examination fees against State depository institutions. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to restrict to Federal depository institutions the assessment of examination fees by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. States that the effective date for banking regulations shall be at the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date the regulation is published in final form in the Federal Register (unless Federal law specifically prescribes otherwise). Amends the Federal Credit Union Act to expand Federal credit union membership from groups having a common bond to groups having common bonds. Declares that any regulation prescribed by the National Credit Union Administration which requires a vote by the membership to approve or disapprove a proposal to transfer credit union deposits to an insured depository institution shall allow the credit union to provide notice of such vote up to 90 days before the date of the vote. Excludes from the gross income of a depository institution, for Federal tax purposes, the fees and income it receives which are attributable to the first $350 million of its total assets."
