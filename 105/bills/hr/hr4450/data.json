    "text": "Children's Act for Responsible Employment - CARE Act - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLRA) to revise child labor prohibitions. (Sec. 2) Repeals certain exemptions from child labor prohibitions for agricultural employment. Applies the same age restrictions to agricultural employment as to other forms of employment. Limits exemptions to agricultural labor outside of school hours, if the individual is employed by his or her parent or legal guardian, on a farm owned or operated by such parent or legal guardian. Raises from 16 to 18 years old the minimum age for engaging in hazardous agricultural employment. (Sec. 3) Prohibits employment of individuals under age 16 in youth peddling. Excludes from the definition of youth peddling volunteer selling of goods or services on behalf of not-for-profit organizations. (Sec. 4) Increases civil and criminal penalties for child labor violations. (Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary of Labor to determine the circumstances under which goods tainted by oppressive child labor may be allowed to be shipped or delivered for shipment in interstate commerce. (Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary to establish closer working relationships with non-governmental organizations and with State and local government agencies with responsibility for administering and enforcing labor and safety and health laws. Requires State and local government agencies to submit information regarding injuries and deaths of employees to the Secretary, upon request, for specified use in enforcement and other uses under FLRA. Authorizes the Secretary to reimburse such agencies for such services. (Sec. 7) Directs the Secretaries of Labor and of Agriculture to enter into a memorandum or understanding to coordinate the development and enforcement of standards to minimize child labor."
