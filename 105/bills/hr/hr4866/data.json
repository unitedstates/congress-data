Directs the FAA Administrator to develop and publish a plan to investigate and test southbound departure procedures from Newark International Airport runway 22 that will result in a minimum 25 percent decrease in aircraft noise on the ground in northwestern Staten Island. Confers standing in U.S. district court upon any Staten Island resident to compel the FAA Administrator to comply with this Act."
