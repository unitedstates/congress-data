Adds as a purpose of the Albuquerque project to reclaim and use nonpotable surface water in the Albuquerque metropolitan area.

(Sec. 7) Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts with the Solano County Water Agency, or any of its member unit contractors for water from the Solano Project, California, pursuant to the Act of February 21, 1911 (subject to a limitation on the portion of the Project that may be used) for: (1) the impounding, storage, and carriage of nonproject water for domestic, municipal, industrial, and other beneficial purposes, using any facilities associated with the Project; and (2) the exchange of water among Project contractors for such purposes, using facilities associated with the Project. (Sec. 8) Amends the Act of December 29, 1950, authorizing construction, operation, and maintenance of the Canadian River reclamation project, Texas, to direct the Secretary to allow use of the project distribution system for transport of water from the Canadian River Conjunctive Use Groundwater Project to municipalities that are receiving water from the project, subject to specified environmental and engineering reviews.
