Sets forth State eligibility requirements for placement of students. Requires States to use methods of distributing IDEA funds that ensure compliance with such requirements. Allows a public agency to reduce or deny reimbursement to parents of a child placed in a private school without the public agency's consent or referral if: (1) the parents (with specified exceptions) did not notify the agency of the intended placement, with a written statement of their concerns, at least ten days before the child's removal from public school; (2) the parents did not make the child available for a local educational agency (LEA) initial assessment and evaluation before the child's removal from public school and enrollment in private school; or (3) it is so ruled at the judge's discretion.

Includes the following categories of behavior, at school or a school function, among those for which school personnel may order removal of a child with a disability from the classroom, and placement in an alternative educational setting, for an additional 45 days over the regular ten-day limit for such a removal: (1) carrying any weapons (current law only covers firearms); (2) having, using, soliciting sale of, or selling medications or illegal drugs; and (3) causing serious physical or emotional injury as a result of physical or verbal assault. Authorizes a hearing officer to order such a change of placement for up to 45 days if there is substantial evidence that maintenance of the current placement is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or to others. Requires an IEP Team to review whether the child's inappropriate action was a manifestation of the disability, including review of the technical soundness of the behavior management plan. Allows change of placement, with the parents' agreement, if the behavior is a result of the disability. Provides for an immediate appeal to the hearing officer if the parents disagree with the determination or the changed educational placement. Allows application to children with disabilities of the same relevant disciplinary procedures applicable to children without disabilities, if the behavior is determined to be not a manifestation of the disability. Allows a due process hearing if the parents disagree with such application of discipline.
