    "text": "Internet Tax Freedom Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 (the Act) to prohibit the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or any State commission from having regulatory authority or jurisdiction with respect to charges paid by subscribers for Internet access or online services (IAOs). Preserves FCC authority and the State commission's authority to: (1) implement the Telecommunications Act of 1996 or the amendments made by such Act; and (2) regulate common carriers that offer IAOs in conjunction with the provision of any telephone toll, telephone exchange, or exchange access services as such terms are defined in title I of the Act. (Sec. 3) Exempts IAOs providers from Federal regulatory fees. Requires the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to determine whether any direct or indirect Federal regulatory fees, other than the fees identified under the Act, are imposed on IAOs providers, and if so, make recommendations to the Congress regarding whether such fees should be modified or eliminated. (Sec. 4) Requires the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with appropriate congressional committees, to examine: (1) barriers imposed in foreign markets on U.S. providers of property, goods, services, or information engaged in electronic commerce and on U.S. providers of telecommunications services; (2) how the imposition of such barriers will affect U.S. consumers, the competitiveness of U.S. citizens providing property, goods, service, or information in foreign markets, and the growth and maturing of the Internet; and (3) what measures the Government should pursue to foster, promote, and develop electronic commerce in the United States and in foreign markets. Directs: (1) the Secretary to report to the President on the results of the examination; and (2) the President to review the report and submit to appropriate congressional committees such policy recommendations as the President deems necessary or expedient. (Sec. 5) Provides for the expedited congressional consideration of legislative recommendations. (Sec. 6) Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should seek bilateral and multilateral agreements through various international organizations to require that the provision of IAOs be free from undue and discriminatory regulation by foreign governments and that electronic commercial transactions between United States and foreign providers of property, goods, services, and information be free from undue and discriminatory regulation, international tariffs, and discriminatory taxation."
