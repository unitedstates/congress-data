Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary of Education to make grants to eligible entities to carry on between ten and 20 such demonstration projects. Requires that not more than two grants of $5 million or less be made in any fiscal year, with one such grant to be given to the District of Columbia if its application meets the requirements of this Act.
