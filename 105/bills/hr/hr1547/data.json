Directs the Director to take the necessary steps to: (1) educate local law enforcement officials on the extent of the immunity from criminal prosecution provided to diplomats and their families; and (2) encourage such officials to investigate and prosecute such individuals who commit a serious criminal offense to the extent consistent with their immunity. Prohibits any Department of State officer or employee from interfering with the investigation or prosecution by a State or local government of a diplomat, or a family member of a diplomat, or any other alien not immune from criminal prosecution."
