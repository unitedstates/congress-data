Limits: (1) annual project acreage; (2) funding sources; (3) project duration; and (4) report expenditures. Authorizes appropriations. Sets forth status and final reporting provisions. Directs the Alternative Agricultural Research and Commercialization Corporation (established under the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990) to evaluate the advisability of making commercialization assistance loans for at least two demonstration projects to convert wood waste or low-quality wood byproducts into higher value products."
