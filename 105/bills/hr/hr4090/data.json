Establishes a permanent Medal of Valor Review Board to select candidates as recipients of the Medal from among those applications received by the National Medal Office (established by this Act). Authorizes appropriations. Establishes within the Department of Justice a National Medal Office to staff the Review Board and to establish criteria and procedures for the submission of recommendations of nominees for the Medal. Repeals provisions of the Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 establishing the President's Award for Outstanding Public Safety Service and the Secretary of Commerce's Award for Distinguished Public Safety Service. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) consult with the Institute of Heraldry within the Department of Defense regarding the design and artistry of the Medal of Valor; and (2) consider suggestions received by the Department of Justice regarding the design of the medal, including those made by persons not employed by the Department."
