Allows such conveyances only after the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has made specified certifications to the Secretary with respect to the appropriate environmental cleanup of such area. Directs the State of Washington to enter into a joint agreement with Benton, Franklin, and Grant Counties to establish the Hanford Reach Protection and Management Commission, which shall develop and implement a plan to manage the lands conveyed by the Secretary in order to protect and enhance plant, fish and wildlife, and cultural resources, as well as recreational access to, and other uses of, Hanford Reach (a 51-mile stretch of land along the Columbia River containing fish, wildlife, and other resources). Requires Adams, Grant, and Franklin Counties to submit to the Secretary: (1) a risk analysis of debris slides in the White Bluffs Wasteway; and (2) a comprehensive land use plan of the Wahluke Slope."
