Directs the Secretary of Commerce, with respect to each decennial and mid-decade census, to report to the appropriate congressional committees on: (1) how it is proposed that the actual enumeration be carried out; (2) what types of surveys or statistical methods are proposed to be used in connection with such enumeration; and (3) how such surveys or methods would help achieve a more accurate census. Requires collection: (1) as part of the decennial census of population or population and housing characteristics data that is used for purposes of determining benefits to State, county, or local units of government; and (2) contemporaneously with the collection of data for purposes of the apportionment of Representatives in Congress among the several States. Authorizes collection of such data through sampling."
