Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Bank and the Clearinghouse on Corporate Responsibility that is being developed by the Department of Commerce should work together to ensure that businesses are made aware of, and have access to, resources and organizations that can assist them in developing and monitoring global codes of corporate conduct."
