    "text": "Freedom to Travel Act of 1997 - Prohibits the President from restricting U.S. citizens or legal residents from traveling abroad, except to countries with which the United States is at war, where armed hostilities are in progress, or where there is imminent danger to the public health or physical safety of U.S. travelers. Revises the areas which the President is expressly denied authority to regulate or prohibit under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Adds to such areas specifically excluded from presidential regulatory authority: (1) normal banking transactions incident to specified travel activities, including the issuance, clearing, processing, or payment of checks, drafts, travelers checks, credit or debit card instruments, or similar instruments; and (2) financial or other transactions, or travel, incident to activities of scholars, educational or academic activities, exchanges, cultural activities, and public exhibitions or performances by the nationals of one country in another country, with specified exceptions. Amends the Trading With the Enemy Act to add similar provisions restricting presidential authority to regulate or prohibit transactions incident to travel by U.S. citizens or residents. Declares that this Act applies notwithstanding certain economic sanctions against Cuba under the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996."
