Requires transfer of such property to the General Services Administration (GSA). Requires Fairfax County to submit to the Administrator of General Services (GSA Administrator) a reuse plan that aims to maximize use of the land for open space, park land, or recreation, while outlining permissible or required uses, potential development densities, and any time limits on such development factors of the property. Requires the Department of the Interior to notify GSA of any property it requests to be transferred to it for a land exchange by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service within Virginia. Requires GSA to transfer such property to the Department at no cost. Prescribes conditions on the transfer of Lorton property east of Ox Road (Route 123). Requires the transfer at no cost to the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority or the Fairfax County Park Authority of any property identified in the Fairfax County reuse plan for park purposes. Requires the GSA Administrator to report to specified congressional committees on related plans and costs. Authorizes appropriations."
