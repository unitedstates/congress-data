    "text": "Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997 - Prohibits the use of appropriated funds to provide or pay for any health care item or service or health benefit coverage for the purpose of causing, or assisting to cause, the death of any individual. Sets forth a nonexclusive list of programs, facilities, and personnel to which the prohibition applies, including under Social Security Act titles V (Maternal and Child Health Services), XVIII (Medicare), XIX (Medicaid), and XX (Block Grants to States for Social Services), the Public Health Service Act, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, and provisions of Federal law relating to Federal employees, the military health care system, veterans medical care, Peace Corps volunteers, and Federal prisoners. Prohibits the use of appropriated funds for: (1) causing or assisting in suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing; (2) compelling any person or entity to provide or fund any item, benefit, program, or service for such purpose; or (3) asserting or advocating a legal right to cause or assist such actions. Sets forth a nonexclusive list of programs to which the prohibition applies, including under specified provisions of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, the Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act of 1986, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Legal Services Corporation Act. Prohibits the use of appropriated funds for any item or service for the purpose of causing or assisting in the suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing of any individual. Declares that, for this Act, references to appropriated funds include funds appropriated to the District of Columbia under specified provisions of the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act. Declares that this Act supersedes other Federal laws except to the extent such laws specifically supersede this Act. Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize grants and contracts (emphasizing palliative medicine) for: (1) research and projects to reduce the rate of suicide among persons with disabilities or terminal or chronic illness; and (2) demonstration projects to reduce restrictions on access to hospice programs or fund home health care services, community living arrangements, and attendant care services."
