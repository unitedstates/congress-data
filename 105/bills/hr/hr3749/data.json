    "text": "Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit a telecommunications carrier or a reseller of telecommunications services from submitting or executing a change in a subscriber's selection of a provider of telephone exchange service or toll service, except in accordance with this Act and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) verification procedures. Requires a carrier or reseller, in verifying a subscriber's selection of a telephone exchange or toll service provider, to require the subscriber to: (1) acknowledge the type of service to be changed by the selection; (2) affirm the intent to select the service provider; (3) affirm that the consumer is the subscriber or is authorized to make such selection for that telephone number; (4) acknowledge that such selection will result in a change of service provider; and (5) provide any other such information the FCC considers appropriate for the subscriber's protection. Requires FCC selection verification procedures to: (1) preclude the use of negative option marketing; (2) provide for verification of a change of provider in oral, written, or electronic form; and (3) require the retention of such verification in a manner and form and for such time as the FCC considers appropriate. Makes the above provisions inapplicable to providers of commercial mobile service. Requires a carrier or reseller selected by a subscriber to notify the subscriber in writing not more than 15 days after the change is processed by the carrier or reseller: (1) of the subscriber's new carrier; and (2) that the subscriber may request information regarding the date of the change and the individual authorizing the change. Requires the FCC to: (1) prescribe a period not to exceed 120 days after receipt of notice of a complaint of an unauthorized change for the carrier or reseller to resolve such complaint; and (2) provide a simplified process for resolving such complaints. Authorizes the FCC, in resolving a complaint, to award damages of: (1) the greater amount of $500 or actual damages; or (2) three times such amount. Provides penalties for violations of this Act and authorizes the FCC to collect fines and damages. Treats an initiation of service as a change in a subscriber's selection for purposes of this Act. Authorizes a State, when it has reason to believe that a carrier or reseller has or is engaged in a practice of changing service providers without subscriber authority, to bring an action on behalf of its residents to enjoin such changes and to recover damages. Gives Federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over such actions. Requires FCC notification of, and authorizes FCC intervention in, any such action. Requires the FCC to report to the Congress on unauthorized changes in subscribers' providers. (Sec. 2) Directs the FCC to issue a report on the telemarketing practices used by carriers or resellers to solicit changes by subscribers in their service providers. Authorizes the FCC to initiate a rulemaking to prohibit particular practices it determines are being used with the intention to mislead, deceive, or confuse subscribers."
