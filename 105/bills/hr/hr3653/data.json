Prohibits the performance of honor guard functions by a member of the Reserve from being considered a period of drill or training otherwise required. Repeals a Federal limitation on the availability of funds for National Guard honor guard functions. Requires the Secretary of Defense to submit to the Congress the directives prescribed by the Secretaries of the military departments to carry out this section."
