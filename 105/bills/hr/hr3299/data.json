    "text": "Family Genetic Privacy and Protection Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to prohibit a group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group coverage, from discriminating in eligibility based on a request for, or receipt of, genetic information or a genetic test. Prohibits such entities from: (1) using genetic information to discriminate in issuance, renewal, premium rates, or benefits; or (2) disclosing or being compelled, by subpoena or any other means, subject to exception, to disclose genetic information about an individual unless authorized by the individual. Amends the Public Health Service Act to apply these prohibitions to coverage in the individual market. Amends Federal law relating to veterans' benefits to mandate standards, consistent with the prohibitions in this Act, regarding genetic information use and disclosure in connection with medical care provided under those provisions. Makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to attempt to acquire, acquire, or use genetic information, or to require a genetic test, of an employee or applicant to discriminate or restrict any right or benefit. Regulates employer disclosure of and access to genetic information. Provides for enforcement through the powers, remedies, and procedures in specified provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Establishes the National Bipartisan Commission on the Use of Genetic Information to make recommendations with respect to the development and implementation of standards: (1) to provide increased protection for the collection, storage, and use of identifiable DNA samples and genetic information obtained from those samples; and (2) for the acquisition and retention of genetic information in all settings, but in particular clinical settings, including appropriate exceptions. Requires the Commission to report to the President and the Congress on its recommendations, findings, and conclusions. Terminates the Commission 30 days after submission of such report."
