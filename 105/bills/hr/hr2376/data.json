    "text": "National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act Amendments of 1998 - Amends the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act to increase the number of members of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation's Board of Directors. Provides for four directors experienced in ocean and coastal resources conservation and adds the Under Secretary for Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere as a nonvoting member. Expands Foundation powers to include the right to: (1) invest and deposit Federal funds; and (2) provide Federal funds to enter into agreements with private landowners for fish, wildlife, and natural resource restoration and enhancement on public and private lands. Revises certain limitations on the use of Federal funds by the Foundation to acquire interests in, convey, or grant such funds to another for, real property to allow such activities if the Foundation notifies the Federal agency that administers the program under which the funds were provided of the proposed activity and the agency fails to object within a certain time period. Removes a limitation on the condemnation of Foundation lands by State or local entities. Prohibits the use of Foundation grants for litigation expenses, activities to influence legislation pending before the Congress, or for activities related to the introduction of wolves or grizzly bears in Idaho, Montana, Utah, or Wyoming. Extends the authorization of appropriations for the Foundation through FY 1999. Repeals a provision that states that amounts authorized under the Act are in addition to any provided for the Foundation under other Federal laws."
