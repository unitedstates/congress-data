Requires the President to identify and select an appropriate remedy that minimizes exposures by comparing alternative remedies and balancing specified factors (effectiveness, reliability, cost, risks) with respect to each remedy. Authorizes the President to defer the selection of a remedial action if he determines that: (1) the hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant can be contained in a manner sufficient to protect human health and the environment; and (2) an innovative technology is expected to be available in the near future that will provide a more cost-effective remedy. Directs the President to determine the appropriate remedy for \"hot spots\" (areas within a facility that contain hazardous substances in high concentrations, that are highly mobile, and that cannot be contained or areas that would present a significant risk to human health or the environment).

Provides for: (1) withdrawal of authorities for improper use or activities (with a requirement of written notice to such State at least 90 days prior to such withdrawal); (2) the enforcement of interagency agreements and remedy selection; (3) procedures to be undertaken upon failure to concur in a remedy selection; and (4) authority transfer limitations. Subtitle B: Superfund and Other Environmental Law Reforms Applicable to Department of Defense or Department of Energy - Makes certain CERCLA standards relating to the attainment of a relevant and appropriate environmental standard inapplicable to a remedial action undertaken at a DOD facility if the facility is not listed on the CERCLA national priorities list. (Sec. 312) Authorizes the Secretary of Defense or Energy, with respect to any site or facility under his or her jurisdiction, to terminate the long-term operation and maintenance of a completed remedial or corrective action in any case in which such Secretary determines, with the concurrence of the Administrator or appropriate State or local authorities, that the release or threatened release of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants at such site or facility is no longer a threat to human health and the environment. (Sec. 313) Prohibits the Secretary of Energy from entering into or agreeing to a major modification of an environmental compliance agreement until after such Secretary submits to the Congress specified cost and budget information.

Title IV: Miscellaneous Additional Defense Reforms - Authorizes the Secretary of the Navy, after FY 1998, to enter into contracts for the long-term lease or charter of newly built surface vessels, or for the provision of a service through use by a contractor of such vessels, for: (1) the Navy combat logistics force; (2) the Navy strategic sealift program; or (3) other auxiliary support vessels for DOD. Requires such contracts to be authorized by law. Outlines provisions concerning: (1) funds for contract payments; (2) contract terms (including an option to buy leased or chartered vessels); (3) the required crewing of such vessels by private sector commercial mariners; and (4) contract termination liability. (Sec. 402) Directs the Secretary, in at least one U.S. metropolitan area containing multiple military installations, to provide for the installation of fiber-optics based telecommunications technology to link as many of the installations in such area as practicable in a privately dedicated telecommunications network.
