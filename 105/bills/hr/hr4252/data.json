Amends BBA '97 with regard to the establishment of a prospective payment system (PPS) for such services to provide that if the Secretary of Health and Human Services does not establish such PPS for specified applicable cost reporting periods, the Secretary shall, for such periods, apply applicable limits under Medicare's reasonable cost requirements as they would otherwise be in effect. Repeals the current requirement that, during such a period, existing limits be reduced by 15 percent."
