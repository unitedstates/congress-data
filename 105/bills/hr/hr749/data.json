    "text": "Amends the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act to allow the intentional removal or excavation of Native American human remains from Federal or tribal lands for purpose of study if consent is obtained from lineal descendants or each appropriate Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization. Requires a Federal agency or instrumentality that receives notice of a discovery of Native American cultural items on lands it manages to notify each appropriate Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization. Requires the committee established to monitor and review the inventory and identification process and repatriation activities to compile an inventory of, and develop a process for, the disposition of funerary objects. Requires that amounts collected as penalties under the Act be used to supplement enforcement appropriations. Authorizes: (1) a reward for furnishing information leading to a civil penalty; and (2) reduction of a penalty amount if the violator agrees to pay certain restitution to the aggrieved parties."
