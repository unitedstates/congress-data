Requires: (1) the political committee to include certain information along with the transferred contribution or donation, such as a request that the FEC return the contribution or donation to the person making it; and (2) the FEC to notify the Attorney General and the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service of the receipt of such contribution or donation. Allows amounts in the special account to be applied toward the payment of any applicable fines or penalties."
