Requires permits for paper and pulp mills which use chlorine or chlorinated oxidizing agents to require compliance with the zero discharge requirement. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to: (1) evaluate alternatives to the use of organochlorines in pulp and paper manufacturing and to publish a report on the transfer to chlorine-free technology in the pulp and paper industry as a model for pollution prevention; (2) provide technical information and support to assist permit applicants in the use of such alternatives; (3) study and report to the Congress on nonpoint sources and industrial discharges of organochlorine compounds and their byproducts and metabolites into navigable waters; and (4) convene an advisory panel to assist in developing recommendations for achieving a zero discharge policy for organochlorine pollution sources."
