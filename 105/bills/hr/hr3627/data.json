Defines a \"brownfield site\" as a parcel of land that contains or contained abandoned or under-used commercial or industrial facilities, the expansion or redevelopment of which is complicated by the presence or potential presence of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. Requires States to submit information to the Administrator on brownfield sites. Directs the Administrator to compile a National Brownfields Registry. (Sec. 112) Requires the Administrator to establish a program to award grants to be used by local governments to capitalize revolving loan funds for the cleanup of brownfield sites and associated properties, rivers, and streams. Authorizes local governments to provide such loans to finance cleanups by such governments or by owners or prospective purchasers of brownfield sites. Gives priority to grant applications that: (1) propose the creation of jobs or job training programs or use existing programs; or (2) involve projects for brownfields located within any empowerment zone or enterprise community. Requires grant recipients to report to the Administrator on the extent of local citizen involvement in funded projects. (Sec. 113) Authorizes appropriations from the Hazardous Substance Superfund (Superfund) for such grants for FY 1999 through 2003. Makes certain facilities ineligible for the grant program, including facilities that are the subject of response actions under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and Federal facilities. Authorizes the President to make exceptions for certain excluded facilities and allow grants on a facility-by-facility basis. (Sec. 116) Amends CERCLA to replace existing conditions on siting with one that prohibits the President from providing any remedial actions unless the State in which the hazardous substance release occurs prohibits the issuance of new permits for hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities located within 5,000 feet of any school, currently used or potentially available body of water, drinking water source, residential dwelling, or hospital. (Sec. 119) Authorizes appropriations for grant programs and for assistance to States for voluntary response programs for FY 1999 through 2001. (Sec. 120) Authorizes the Administrator to award grants and cooperative agreements to States, Indian tribes, municipalities, and other entities for training, technology transfer, and information dissemination programs to strengthen environmental response activities. (Sec. 121) Requires the Administrator to provide financial assistance for brownfields workforce training programs in communities that contain brownfield sites. (Sec. 123) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to require Superfund to be available for natural resource damage assessment, restoration, rehabilitation, and replacement activities carried out under CERCLA. Title II: Department of Housing and Urban Development Brownfield Grants - Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to direct the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to make grants, in connection with the authority to guarantee obligations to finance certain community development activities, to eligible public entities for projects for the cleanup and economic redevelopment of brownfield sites. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1999 through 2001."
