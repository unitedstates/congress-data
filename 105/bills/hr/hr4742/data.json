Requires the Secretary to modify such requirements to ensure that written notice of a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease is provided on ticket stock and any accompanying itinerary. Directs the Secretary to conduct a rulemaking proceeding to require: (1) a ticket agent for air transportation to disclose verbally to a prospective air ticket buyer the commissions paid to the ticket agent by all air carriers serving the markets of interest to the prospective consumer; (2) each air carrier to keep records and publish statistics concerning the possibility of redeeming frequent flyer benefits offered by the air carrier for air transportation between any of its city-pair markets; and (3) each air carrier to publish on the Internet, and update every 24 hours, the available fares for air transportation it offers on each flight scheduled for departure."
