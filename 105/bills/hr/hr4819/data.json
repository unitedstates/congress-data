    "text": "Passenger Services Enhancement Act - Amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to continue, indefinitely, the use of customs user fees (to the extent funds remain available after making certain reimbursements) for salaries for up to 50 full- time equivalent inspectional positions to provide preclearance customs services. Decreases from $6.50 to $5 the customs user fee charged to each passenger that arrives aboard a commercial vessel or commercial aircraft from a place outside the U.S. customs (except $1.75 shall be charged to each passenger aboard a commercial vessel that arrives from Canada, Mexico, a U.S. territory or possession, or an adjacent island). Earmarks a specified amount of certain customs user fees to the Customs Service for automated commercial systems. Directs the Commissioner of Customs to establish an advisory committee, consisting of representatives from the airline, cruise ship, and other transportation industries, to advise the Commissioner on issues related to the performance of the inspectional services of the Customs Service. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to authorize the Secretary, for a specified period, to prescribe an alternative mid-point interest accounting methodology, which may be employed by the importer, based upon aggregate data in lieu of accounting for such interest from each deposit data provided."
