Directs the Comptroller General of the United States to study the effects of such credit, including the types of recipient organizations and the services they provide to the poor. Title II: Budget Offset - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce the earned income credit for individuals without children. Title III: Bankruptcy Protections for Charitable Donations - Amends Federal bankruptcy law to exclude certain charitable contribution transfers from being deemed fraudulent transfers. Title IV: Tort Reforms Relating to Charitable Contributions - Exempts a business entity, under specified circumstances and with exceptions, from civil liability for injury or death resulting from: (1) the use by a nonprofit organization of donated equipment, facilities, or loan of aircraft or motor vehicles; and (2) business facility tours. Authorizes a State to make such non-liability provisions inapplicable in an action in which all parties are its citizens."
