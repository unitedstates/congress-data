    "text": "Bangladeshi Adjustment Act - Requires the Attorney General to adjust to lawful permanent resident alien the status of any national of Bangladesh who has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period between January 1, 1987, and the date an application for adjustment is filed, if the alien: (1) applies for such adjustment before July 1, 2000; and (2) is otherwise admissible to the United States for permanent residence. States that, in the determination of such admissibility, certain grounds for inadmissibility in the Immigration and Nationality Act shall not apply. Allows an alien present in the United States to apply for such status adjustment even though he or she has been ordered excluded, deported, removed, or ordered to depart voluntarily from the United States. Requires the Attorney General to cancel the order if the application is granted; but if the application is denied by a final administrative decision, the order shall be effective and enforceable to the same extent as if the application had not been made. Authorizes the Attorney General to: (1) allow an alien who has applied for adjustment of status to engage in employment in the United States during the pendency of such application; and (2) provide the alien with an \"employment authorized\" endorsement or other appropriate document. Requires the Attorney General to authorize such employment if such application is pending for a period exceeding 180 days, and has not been denied. Provides for the adjustment of status for spouses and children of such aliens. Outlines the availability of administrative review for applicants for adjustment of status as well as the preclusion of judicial review for final Attorney General determinations as to the adjustability of alien status."
