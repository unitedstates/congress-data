Declares that a specified amount of bilateral economic assistance should be made available for Bolivia. (Sec. 401) Prohibits the use of funds appropriated for the U.S. quota in the IMF until the Secretary of the Treasury reports to the appropriate congressional committees that it is IMF policy that arrangements in excess of $500 million involving the use of resources available to the IMF shall include provisions committing the borrowing country to: (1) comply with the terms of international trade agreements of which the country is a signatory; (2) eliminate the policy of Government-directed lending by financial institutions; and (3) guarantee nondiscriminatory treatment in debt resolution proceedings between domestic and foreign creditors and debtors and other concerned persons. (Sec. 402) Requires the Secretary to report to the appropriate congressional committees on: (1) the implementation of IMF-led financial stabilization programs in countries in connection with which the United States has made a commitment to provide or has provided financing from the exchange stabilization fund; and (2) impending disbursements to such countries.

International Monetary Fund Reform and Authorization Act of 1998 - Amends the Bretton Woods Agreement Act to authorize the U.S. Governor of the IMF to consent, subject to appropriations, to a specified increase in the U.S. IMF quota of Special Drawing Rights.

(Sec. 406) Sets forth conforming amendments for Federal participation in new arrangements to borrow. (Sec. 407) Amends the International Financial Institutions Act (the Act) to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Director of the IMF to promote specified policies, including: (1) structuring programs and assistance so as to promote policies and actions that will contribute to exchange rate stability and avoid competitive devaluations; (2) promoting market-oriented reform, trade liberalization, economic growth, democratic governance, and social stability through certain measures; (3) strengthening financial systems in developing countries and encouraging the adoption of sound banking principles and practices; (4) facilitating the development and implementation of internationally acceptable domestic bankruptcy laws in developing countries; (5) promoting policies that aim at appropriate burden-sharing by the private sector so that investors and creditors bear more fully the consequences of their decisions; (6) fostering structural reforms, including procurement reform, that reduce opportunities for corruption, bribery, and drug-related money laundering; (7) designing IMF programs and assistance so that governments channel public funds away from unproductive purposes, including large showcase projects and excessive military spending, and toward investment in human and physical capital; (8) structuring IMF programs and assistance so that improvement of labor standards is incorporated as an integral goal in the policy dialogue with recipient countries; (9) discouraging practices which may promote ethnic or social strife in a recipient country; (10) promoting IMF recognition that macroeconomic developments and policies can affect and be affected by environmental conditions and policies; (11) facilitating greater IMF transparency and accountability; and (12) promoting structural reforms which facilitate credit to small businesses, including microenterprise lending, especially in the world's poorest, heavily indebted countries.
