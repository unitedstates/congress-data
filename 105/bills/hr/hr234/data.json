Allows employees covered by such Act to take up to four hours during any 30-day period, and up to 24 hours during any 12-month period, of parental involvement leave to participate in or attend their children's educational and extracurricular activities. Amends Federal civil service law to apply the same parental involvement leave allowance to Federal employees. Provides that leave under such Act may be taken to meet: (1) routine family medical needs, including transportation of children for medical and dental appointments for annual checkups and vaccinations; and (2) the routine medical care needs of elderly relatives of the eligible employee, including visits to nursing homes and group homes."
