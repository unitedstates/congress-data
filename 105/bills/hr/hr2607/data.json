    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Fiscal Year 1998 Appropriations Title II: Clarification of Eligibility For Relief From Removal and Deportation For Certain Aliens Makes appropriations for the District of Columbia for FY 1998. Title I: Fiscal Year 1998 Appropriations - District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 1998 - Appropriates Federal funds for: (1) payment for management reform; (2) the contribution to the operation of the District government; (3) payment to the District's Corrections Trustee; (4) payment to the District's Corrections Trustee for Correctional Facilities; and (5) payment to the District's criminal justice system. Appropriates specified sums out of the District's general fund (and other funds, in some cases) for the current fiscal year for: (1) governmental direction and support; (2) economic development and regulation; (3) public safety and justice; (4) the public education system; (5) human support services; (6) public works; (7) financing and other uses; (8) enterprise funds and other uses; (9) the Water and Sewer Authority and the Washington Aqueduct; (10) the Lottery and Charitable Games Control Board; (11) the Starplex Fund; (12) the District of Columbia (D.C.) General Hospital; (13) the D.C. Retirement Board; (14) the Correctional Industries Fund; (15) the Washington Convention Center Enterprise Fund; (16) the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority (Authority); (17) capital outlay; and (18) deficit reduction and revitalization. Sets forth authorized uses of, and limitations on, such funds. Bars the use of revenues from Federal sources to support the operations of the D.C. Statehood and Statehood Compact Commissions. Requires the District to identify the sources of funding for Admission to Statehood from its own locally-generated revenues. (Sec. 110) Prohibits funds appropriated in this Act from being available to pay the salary of any District government employee whose name, title, grade, salary, work experience, and salary history are not available for inspection by specified congressional committees and subcommittees and the District Council. (Sec. 114) Bars the D.C. Mayor from borrowing any funds for capital projects without prior approval of the Council. (Sec. 124) Applies any sequestration orders under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to each account appropriating Federal funds in this Act rather than to the aggregate total of such accounts. Requires the Mayor, in the event such an order is issued after amounts appropriated to the District have been paid, to pay sequestered amounts to the Secretary of the Treasury. (Sec. 127) Bars the use of Federal funds provided in this Act to provide for salaries or other expenses associated with the offices of U.S. Senator or Representative under the District of Columbia Statehood Constitutional Convention Initiatives of 1979. (Sec. 130) Amends the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973 to require the Authority (currently, the Mayor) to submit certain annual reports and plans on performance accountability of the District government to specified congressional committees and the Comptroller General. Requires the Chief Financial Officer (currently, the Mayor) to submit annual plans and reports regarding financial accountability as well as quarterly financial reports. Changes the deadline for the initial plans and reports.
