    "text": "Commends: (1) the Government of Guatemala and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) for carrying out the first phase of implementation of the peace accords signed by the parties on December 29, 1996; (2) such Government and President Alvaro Arzu for the steps taken to tackle corruption and to strengthen civilian control over the armed forces and for putting in place the joint action commissions that will play a critical role in the implementation of the peace accords; (3) the United Nations for its work in facilitating the peace agreement and verifying the accords; and (4) the Group of Friends (Colombia, Mexico, Norway, Spain, the United States, and Venezuela) for their support of the peace process in Guatemala. Notes the need for the greatest possible democratic participation in implementing the accords. Calls on such Government, the URNG, and the United Nations Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA) to promote dialogue and consensus-building with the political parties, private sector, and civil society groups. Notes the continued involvement of military intelligence in operational police matters revealed in the Mincho case. Calls on the Government of Guatemala, with the cooperation of the URNG and MINUGUA, to conduct a full investigation into such case and to ensure strict compliance with the provisions of the peace accords regarding the role of intelligence structures. Calls on such Government to: (1) provide financial, logistical, and other support to the Clarification Commission to carry out its work and to act upon the Commission's findings; (2) continue strengthening the climate of respect for human rights and interpreting the Law of National Reconciliation in such a manner that those who committed human rights violations during the armed conflict do not escape justice; (3) continue to facilitate the return of Guatemalan refugees currently living in Mexico pursuant to the October 8, 1992, agreement between such Government and the Guatemalan refugee groups; and (4) take prompt measures to increase its revenues in order to implement the socioeconomic commitments of the peace accords and to resolve the land disputes that have raised tensions in the countryside. Calls on the Clinton Administration to: (1) monitor closely the peace process in Guatemala, to support full implementation of the peace accords, and to provide adequate funds for reconstruction and development, with particular emphasis on strengthening the justice system, building a new civilian police force, alleviating extreme poverty, and ensuring the full integration of indigenous people and women into the political and economic system; (2) ensure that any U.S. assistance to the Guatemalan military be limited exclusively to aid that carries out the objectives of the peace accords of increasing civilian control over the military, limiting the role of the Guatemalan armed forces to defense of sovereignty and national security and fostering greater respect for human rights; and (3) support the work of the Commission by declassifying documents that may shed light on human rights violations committed during the Guatemalan conflict and making those documents available to the Commission and to the public."
