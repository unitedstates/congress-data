Declares such IA program should be funded at a level that allows its funds to be made available on the currently-required, forward-funded basis. Declares that the Secretary of Education, upon completion of the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for each fiscal year, should distribute such IA program payments to eligible LEAs within 45 days after the enactment of each such Act, if other congressional action has not caused a delay and State education agencies have supplied all the necessary information to the Department of Education for such distribution of payments."
