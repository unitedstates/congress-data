Declares that the Congress looks forward to working with the new Albanian Government as it works to build democratic institutions and promote political reconciliation in Albania. Urges the new Government and President of Albania to: (1) embrace pluralism and to foster cooperation and reconciliation among the political forces in Albania; (2) foster trust with its citizenry to achieve stability in the region; (3) take steps toward further developing a market-based economy; (4) pursue investigations, in cooperation with appropriate international financial institutions, into the pyramid investment schemes that cost hundreds of thousands of Albanians their savings; and (5) ensure freedom of the press and media access for all interested parties. Calls for the United States to assist the new Albanian Government in its efforts to build strong democratic institutions, bring about economic reform, promote the rule of law, and reconstitute a professional Albanian military and police."
