Encourages: (1) AFRC members to negotiate a hand-over of power back to the democratically elected Government; and (2) all of the country's citizens to work together to bring about a peaceful solution to the current conflict. Reaffirms U.S. support of the government led by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. Commends the Organization of African Unity for calling on all African countries and the international community to refrain from recognizing the new regime or lending support to the AFRC."
