Urges: (1) the guerrilla leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN) to end the violence, sever their relationship with narcotics traffickers, negotiate a peace accord with the Colombian Government, and take their agenda into the political arena for debate; (2) the FARC and ELN leadership to release the U.S. missionaries being held hostage in Colombia or account for their whereabouts; (3) the Colombian Government to end the guerrilla conflict and take greater action against paramilitary units that commit gross human rights violations; (4) the international community, particularly the Organization of American States, to play a more proactive role in resolving the conflict; and (5) the administration to reevaluate U.S. policies toward Colombia and consider that government's request for U.S. assistance in resolving the conflict."
