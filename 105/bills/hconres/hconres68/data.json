Commends the President for hosting the \"Friends of Lebanon\" conference on December 16, 1996, and urges the President to take further steps to assist Lebanon's reconstruction. Calls for: (1) the withdrawal of all non-Lebanese forces from Lebanon; (2) the President to consider resolving the presence of non-Lebanese forces in Lebanon without relying exclusively upon a comprehensive peace in the region; (3) the security of Lebanon from interference from its neighbors; (4) the President to negotiate directly with officials of the Government of Lebanon on issues pertaining to Lebanon; (5) Lebanon to assert more independence to assure the international community that it has the political will and military capability to guarantee security along its borders for itself and its neighbors and disarm all militias; (6) Lebanon to respect freedom of the press, human rights, judicial due process, political freedom, the right of association, and freedom of assembly; and (7) the President to use such guidelines in formulating U.S. policy toward Lebanon. Commends the Lebanese Government for its determination to hold municipal elections for the first time since 1963."
