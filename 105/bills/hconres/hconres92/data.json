Expresses the intent of Congress: (1) to maintain, through appropriate mutually agreed political and economic measures, the long-term military alliance and strategic partnership defined by the Compact as a primary element of bilateral relations in the future; and (2) through its oversight responsibilities and the exercise of its constitutional authority regarding negotiation and approval of bilateral agreements with respect to the Compact's provisions which expire in 2001, to exercise vigilance in preserving the strategic U.S. interests in ensuring that the friendship between the Islands and the United States is sustained as mutually agreed pursuant to their respective constitutional processes."
