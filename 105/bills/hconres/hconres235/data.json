    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Congress that the violent repression carried out by the Serbian police and paramilitary forces against the ethnic Albanian population of Kosova should be condemned by the United States and the international community. Commends efforts of the international contact group (the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and Italy) in support of a resolution of the conflict in Kosova. Opposes termination of international or U.S. sanctions against the Government of Serbia and Montenegro, unless such termination serves to support a peaceful resolution to the repression in Kosova. Urges the United States to: (1) consult with its allies and other members of the United Nations on reimposing sanctions against Serbia-Montenegro that were terminated following the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement in 1995 if Serbian authorities continue to use unlawful violence against the Albanian people of Kosova; (2) acknowledge recent developments in Montenegro that indicate that the new leadership of that Republic is seeking a peaceful resolution to the repression in Kosova; (3) recognize positive actions by the Montenegro Government regarding repression in Kosova through exclusion from sanctions that may be applied to the Serbian Government; and (4) undertake determined measures and provisions designed to promote human rights and democratic government throughout Serbia and Montenegro. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the elections in Kosova scheduled for March 22, 1998, and now postponed, should be allowed to proceed unimpeded by Belgrade whenever they take place; (2) all parties should refrain from acts that could lead to heightened tensions in Kosova; (3) international and nongovernmental organizations that provide medical assistance should be permitted immediate and unrestricted access to Kosova and all of its citizens; (4) international investigators of serious breaches of international humanitarian law should be granted immediate and unimpeded access to all parts of Kosova and to its citizens; (5) the agreement on education in Kosova should be implemented immediately; (6) the elected leaders of Kosova should begin a dialog without preconditions with the authorities in Belgrade to resolve the present situation and to provide for the exercise of the legitimate civil and political rights of all the people of Kosova; (7) the authorities of Serbia-Montenegro should cooperate fully with efforts and initiatives of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to address the problems of Kosova; (8) staff of the United States Information office in Pristina, Kosova, should be augmented; and (9) the United Nations Security Council should consider the question of restoration of the human and political rights of the people of Kosova and actions to halt Belgrade's violent repression of the region's population."
