Urges countries which have not already done so to return such properties to their rightful owners or, when actual return is not possible, to pay prompt, just and effective compensation. Calls for the return of such properties to religious communities. Calls on Croatia, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and any other nation whose laws or regulations limit restitution or compensation for such properties to persons who reside in, or are citizens of, the country from which restitution or compensation is sought, to remove such restrictions. Urges former totalitarian countries to implement laws that provide for restitution of, or compensation for, wrongfully expropriated property."
