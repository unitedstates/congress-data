Urges the guerilla leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the National Liberation Army to end the violence and sever their relationship with narcotics traffickers, to negotiate a peace accord with the Colombian Government, and to take their agenda into the political arena for debate. Calls upon the international community, particularly the Organization of American States, to continue to play a more proactive role in trying to resolve the conflict. Urges the Administration to reevaluate U.S. policies toward Colombia and to encourage a peaceful resolution of the conflict."
