Includes among articles of impeachment: (1) usurping the power of impeachment that vests exclusively in the House of Representatives and impeding the exercise of such power by the House; (2) unconstitutionally undermining the office of President and impeding the President's ability to discharge his duties; (3) unconstitutionally arrogating unto himself powers assigned to the Federal courts, undermining the institution of the grand jury, and undermining the office of independent counsel and other offices charged with investigating and prosecuting crimes against the United States; (4) embarrassing the United States before the international community and undermining the ability of the three branches to discharge duties assigned under the Constitution; and (5) violating the oath he took to support and defend the Constitution."
