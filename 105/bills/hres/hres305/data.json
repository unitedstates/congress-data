Makes it in order at any time before November 10, 1997, for the Speaker to entertain motions that the House suspend the rules, provided that the object of any such motion is announced from the House floor at least one hour before its consideration. Provides that, during the remainder of the first session of the 105th Congress, a resolution noticed as a question of the privileges of the House between November 4, 1997, and the adoption of this resolution shall have precedence of all other questions except motions to adjourn only at a time designated by the Speaker.
