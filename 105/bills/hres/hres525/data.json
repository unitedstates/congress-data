Provides for certain portions of such transmitted material to be printed as a House document. Deems the balance of such material to have been received in executive session and requires its release from such status on September 28, 1998, except as otherwise determined by the Committee. Requires the released material to immediately be printed as a House document. Deems additional material compiled by the Committee during the review as received in executive session unless it is received in an open session of the Committee. Restricts access to executive-session material of the Committee relating to the review to members of the Committee, and to such employees of the Committee that are designated by the chairman after consultation with the ranking minority member. Requires each meeting, hearing, or deposition of the Committee relating to the review to be conducted in executive session unless otherwise determined by an affirmative vote of the Committee, a majority being present. Limits attendance at such session to members of the Committee and to such employees of the Committee that are designated by the chairman after consultation with the ranking minority member."
