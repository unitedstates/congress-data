Calls on the Government of Algeria to: (1) take all necessary and legal steps to stop and prevent violence; (2) cooperate with the international community to ensure transparency in the investigation and combating of terrorist activity; and (3) engage in dialogue with all elements of Algerian society who have renounced violence in order to further democracy and promote national reconciliation. Urges the U.S. Government to continue to work closely with the Algerian Government to bring about the development and implementation of political and economic reforms as well as the full restoration of law and order in Algeria. Encourages: (1) the European Union and the Algerian Government to further their cooperation against terrorism; and (2) the Algerian Government to accept the appointment of a Special Rapporteur by the United Nations or another qualified independent organization to conduct an inquiry into human rights violations in Algeria."
