Commends the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) for its work in establishing peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Encourages the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), other institutions, and non-governmental organizations to promote further rebuilding of democratic institutions and civic society in Bosnia and Herzegovina and neighboring countries. Opposes admission to international organizations and fora of, and the receipt of certain loans and financial or technical assistance from international financial institutions by, the parties to the Agreement until such states have complied with their obligations under the Agreement and United Nations Security Council Resolutions to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal. Urges: (1) the United States and the international community to oppose secession by any entity from the unified state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to actively support the work of the parties to establish democratic institutions and the rule of law in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to increase support for the efforts of the Tribunal, and to support the request of the Tribunal President for the High Representative to impose sanction on those who have not complied with their obligations to cooperate fully with the Tribunal; (2) the signatories to the Agreement and those nations and organizations participating in its implementation to ensure full implementation of the arms control and confidence-building agreements reached as part of the Agreement; (3) IFOR, the NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR), the International Police Task Force, and other designated missions to make it an urgent priority to detain and bring to justice persons indicted by the Tribunal; (4) IFOR and SFOR to take an active role in ensuring respect by the parties to the Agreement for freedom of movement throughout the country; and (5) the United States, OSCE, and the international community to press the Serbian Government to recognize the results of recent elections, facilitate installation of duly elected opposition candidates, undertake a dialogue with democratic forces working for reform, and act immediately to improve respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
