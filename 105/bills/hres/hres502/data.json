Urges: (1) the guerrilla leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN) to end the violence, sever their relationship with narcotics traffickers, and negotiate a peace accord with the new Government of Colombia; (2) the incoming Pastrana government to take greater action against paramilitary units that commit gross human rights violations; (3) the leadership of FARC and ELN to release all hostages currently being held or to account for their whereabouts; (4) the international community to play a more proactive role in trying to resolve the internal conflict; and (5) the Administration to reevaluate U.S. policies toward Colombia and review the need for U.S. assistance."
