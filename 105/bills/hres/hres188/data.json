Urges the executive branch to enforce such Act with respect to the acquisition by Iran of such missiles. Recommends that the Secretary of State not issue any visa to, and the Attorney General not admit to the United States, any national of the People's Republic of China who has been materially involved in the proliferation of advanced conventional weapons, nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or technology, or other sensitive or dual-use technologies, in contravention of U.S. interests. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the President should demand that the Government of Russia take concrete actions to stop governmental and nongovernmental entities in the Russian Federation from providing missile technology and technical advice to Iran in violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime; (2) if the Russian response is inadequate, the United States should impose sanctions on the responsible Russian entities in accordance with a specified executive order on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and reassess cooperative activities with Russia; (3) the threshold for the waiver of the prohibition on the release of foreign assistance to Russia should be raised; and (4) the European allies of the United States should be encouraged to take steps to stop such proliferation."
