Urges: (1) the United States Information Agency to expand its economic, political, and human rights programming in Africa to support indigenous efforts aimed at promoting democratization, human rights, economic development, and good governance; and (2) the Agency for International Development to adopt a comprehensive strategy for the promotion of free and independent African media, especially radio. Urges the U.S. Government to: (1) encourage local and foreign investment in independent local radio operations in Africa; (2) make freedom of speech and the safety of journalists a priority in discussions with African governments on democracy and human rights; (3) use all reasonable means to help safeguard the operation of independent radio stations and the legitimate activities of journalists in African countries; and (4) support and assist the development of mechanisms and institutions for the protection of independent journalists and to discourage the use of draconian laws and government policies inhibiting freedom of speech in Africa."
