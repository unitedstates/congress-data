Calls on the Gabonese Government to: (1) take further measures to help ensure a credible election and the independence and impartiality of the election commission; (2) further welcome IFES, the National Democratic Institute, the International Republican Institute, or other appropriate international nongovernmental organizations to aid the organization and oversight of the December 1998 Presidential election in Gabon in an effort to ensure that these elections are free and fair; and (3) take all necessary and lawful steps toward conducting free and fair elections. Calls on: (1) the international community to join the United States in offering assistance toward conducting free and fair elections in Gabon; (2) the U.S. Government to continue to provide support directly and through appropriate nongovernmental organizations toward that end; and (3) the U.S. Government and the international community to continue to encourage the Gabonese Government to ensure a lasting and committed transition to democracy."
