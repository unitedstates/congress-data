    "text": "Protection of Children from Methamphetamine Act of 2005 - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to provide for a 20-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for the manufacture of methamphetamine on premises in which an individual under age 18 resides. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study to determine: (1) the extent to which food, water, air, soil, equipment, or other matter becomes contaminated with methamphetamine or other harmful substances as a result of proximity to the methamphetamine manufacturing process; and (2) whether any adverse health conditions result from children's exposure to such process or to contaminated matter. Directs the Secretary to make grants to eligible States (i.e., those which had more than 200 methamphetamine lab seizures in 2004) to carry out programs to provide a comprehensive response to the health and mental health problems of children that are associated with living in a home in which methamphetamine is unlawfully manufactured, administered, or distributed. Requires the Secretary to ensure that the procedures and services of programs carried out with such grants include: (1) coordination among law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, child protective services, and health professionals; (2) removal of children from toxic or drug-endangering environments; and (3) medical and dental health evaluation and services, drug and toxic chemical exposure screening, and mental health evaluation and services."
