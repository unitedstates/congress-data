Directs the Secretary to publish assistance eligibility and priority criteria. Limits the federal cost share of the project to 50%. Sets the nonfederal cost share for project operation and maintenance at 100%. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with institutions of higher education, nonprofit research institutions, or organizations with water or power delivery authority to fund research to conserve water, increase water use efficiency, or enhance water management."
