    "text": "Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act - Designates specified areas in Mendocino and Six Rivers National Forests and in Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, and Napa Counties in the State of California as wilderness areas and as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Requires that such lands be administered by the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture, whoever has current administrative jurisdiction. Withdraws such federal lands designated as wilderness by this Act from all forms of: (1) entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; (2) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws, and (3) disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing or mineral materials. Releases from further wilderness study those portions of: (1) the King Range Wilderness Study Area, Chemise Mountain Instant Study Area, Red Mountain Wilderness Study Area, and Cedar Roughs Wilderness Study Area not designated as wilderness; and (2) the Rocky Creek/Cache Creek Wilderness Study Area in Lake County, California, not designated as wilderness. Designates certain public land in the State administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) generally known as the South Fork Eel River Wilderness Area and Elkhorn Ridge Potential Wilderness as a potential wilderness area. Requires that the Secretary of the Interior manage such lands as wilderness and carry out ecological restoration activities. Designates specified segments of the Black Butte River in the State as a wild and scenic river. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to submit a fire management plan and a report on the cultural and historic resources of Black Butte River. Includes land identified as the King Range National Conservation Area Additions in the King Range Wilderness Area. Establishes the Cow Mountain Recreation Area in Lake and Mendocino Counties, California. Allows the Secretary of the Interior to acquire lands or interests in lands in the Recreation Area from willing persons only. Requires lands or interests in lands within or adjacent to the boundaries of the Recreation Area that are acquired by BLM, and title or possession of which is vested in the United States, to be managed by such Secretary as part of the Recreation Area. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, in order to continue traditional commercial surf fishing, to permit the right of entry for authorized vehicle access onto the wave slope area at that area known as Gold Bluffs Beach, Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, and that part of the beach north and south Redwood Creek in Redwood National and State Parks."
