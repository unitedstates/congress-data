    "as": "Reported to House amended", 
    "date": "2005-06-23", 
    "text": "Authorizes the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to establish a Science and Technology Scholarship Program to award scholarships to students at institutions of higher education to recruit and prepare them for careers in the National Weather Service and in NOAA marine research, atmospheric research, and satellite programs. Sets forth provisions governing such Program. Requires individuals to be selected to receive scholarships under this Act through a competitive process primarily based on academic merit, with consideration given to financial need and to the goal of promoting the participation of of certain individuals identified under the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act, including those from historically black colleges and universities and institutions serving a large proportion of minorities or other underrepresented populations. Requires the Administrator to enter into contractual agreements with selected individuals under which such individuals, in exchange for receiving a scholarship, agree to serve as full-time employees of NOAA, for a 24-month period of obligated service for each academic year for which a scholarship is provided in positions needed by NOAA in marine research, atmospheric research, and satellite programs. Instructs the Administrator to make publicly available a list of academic programs and fields of study for which scholarships may be utilized in marine research, atmospheric research, and satellite programs and to update such list as necessary. Prohibits: (1) an individual from receiving a scholarship for more than four academic years, unless the Administrator grants a waiver; and (2) the amount of a scholarship from exceeding the cost of attendance. Permits a scholarship to be used for tuition, fees, and other authorized uses as established by the Administrator by regulation. Allows the Administrator to enter into a contractual agreement with an institution of higher education under which the amounts provided for a scholarship for tuition, fees, and other authorized expenses are paid directly to the institution with respect to which the scholarship is provided. Sets forth penalties for specified breaches of scholarship agreements."
