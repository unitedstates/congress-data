    "text": "Domestic Violence Screening, Treatment, and Prevention Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), to award grants for the development of interdisciplinary training and education programs that provide health professions students with an understanding of, and clinical skills pertinent to, domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, and dating violence. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to award grants to strengthen the response of state, tribal, territorial, or local health care systems to such violence. Amends title V (Maternal and Child Health Services) of the Social Security Act to give preference in awarding maternal and child health services grant funds to applicants that provide training for service providers in how to identify and treat the health effects of such violence. Requires states to set aside a reasonable portion of such funds to provide for such violence services. Directs the Secretary to allot additional funds to enable states to provide for identification and treatment of such violence. Allows the Secretary to awards grants to federally qualified health centers to improve the identification and treatment of such violence. Amends the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 to require the Secretary, acting through the Directors of CDC and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), to fund research on effective interventions in the health care setting that: (1) prevent domestic violence, dating violence, and sexual assault across the lifespan; (2) prevent the health effects of such violence; and (3) improve the safety and health of individuals who are currently being victimized."
