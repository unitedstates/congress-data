Outlines conditions under which Department facilities shall be deemed geographically inaccessible. Authorizes the Secretary to waive the requirement of geographic inaccessibility, on a case-by-case basis, if the costs to the Department of providing such care significantly outweigh the benefits of localized health care for the veteran."
