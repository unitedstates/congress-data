    "text": "Reducing Crime and Terrorism at America's Seaports Act of 2005 - Amends the federal criminal code to prohibit: (1) entry by false pretenses to a secure area of a seaport; (2) knowingly failing to obey an order to heave to by an authorized federal law enforcement officer; (3) forcibly interfering with an authorized law enforcement action or providing materially false information during a boarding; and (4) willfully disabling a passenger vehicle. Sets penalties for: (1) knowingly and intentionally placing in U.S. navigable waters a device or dangerous substance likely to destroy or damage a vessel or its cargo or likely to interfere with safe navigation or maritime commerce; (2) intentionally damaging or altering any aid to maritime navigation which endangers the safe navigation of a ship; and (3) transporting aboard any vessel explosive, biological, chemical, or radioactive or nuclear material to be used to commit terrorism. Sets penalties for: (1) knowingly transporting a terrorist aboard any vessel; (2) willfully causing destruction of, disabling, or interfering with the operation of a vessel or maritime facility; and (3) imparting or conveying false information concerning an attempt made to commit criminal acts related to shipping. Expands the scope of a prohibition against theft of interstate or foreign shipments.

Increases penalties for stowaways on vessels or aircraft. Prohibits bribery affecting port security."
