Treats all distributions of the money or property of an electing S corporation as a distribution in part or full payment in exchange for the stock of such corporation. Requires transferee partnerships to maintain the continuity of the S corporation's business for five years after the conversion to partnership form or pay a recapture tax in the year in which failure to maintain such continuity first occurs."
