    "text": "Utah Test and Training Range Protection Act - States that nothing in this Act or the Wilderness Act shall: (1) preclude low-level overflights and operations of military aircraft, missiles, or unmanned aerial vehicles over the Utah Test and Training Range, including the Dugway Proving Ground; (2) preclude the designation of new or expansion of existing units of special use airspace or the use or establishment of military training routes over such area; (3) prevent any required maintenance of existing communications, instrumentation, or electronic tracking systems in the area or the addition of communications, instrumentation, or equipment necessary for effective testing and training upon specified determinations by the Secretary of the Interior; or (4) preclude the continuation of a current memorandum of understanding between the Departments of the Interior and Air Force with respect to emergency access and response within the area. Directs the Secretary to develop, maintain, and revise land use plans for Federal lands located in the area, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense. Limits the issuance of rights-of-way in the area. Designates certain Federal lands in Tooele County, Utah, as the Cedar Mountain Wilderness Area. Withdraws such lands from all forms of entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws, including mining and mineral and geothermal leasing. Releases the Browns Springs Cherrystem area from its status as a wilderness study area. Directs the Secretary to place certain Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land in trust for the Skull Valley Band of Goshutes for the purposes of economic development of such tribe."
