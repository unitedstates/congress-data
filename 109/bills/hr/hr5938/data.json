Requires the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to: (1) make grants to local educational agencies to reduce childhood obesity by adopting wellness policies and anti-obesity initiatives; (2) arrange for the evaluation of a wide variety of existing programs designed to prevent obesity in children and adolescents in order to identify factors contributing to program effectiveness; and (3) make grants on a competitive basis to state governments, local governments, and consortia of local governments to reduce childhood obesity through establishing or expanding healthy living and wellness coordinating councils and supporting regional workshops."
