    "text": "Medicaid State Long-Term Care Partnership Program Act of 2005 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) with respect to the requirement that a state seek adjustment or recovery of any medical assistance correctly paid on behalf of an individual under the state plan in the case of an individual who has received (or is entitled to receive) benefits under a long-term care insurance policy in connection with which assets or resources are disregarded in specified manner. Converts to a discretionary option the current requirement that the state seek adjustment or recovery from an individual's estate on account of medical assistance paid on the individual's behalf for nursing facility and other long-term care services. Exempts from application of such authority the case of an individual who received medical assistance under a state plan of a state which has a state plan amendment that provides for a qualified state long-term care insurance partnership. Defines \"qualified state long-term care insurance partnership\" to mean a state plan amendment under title XIX that provides for the disregard of any assets or resources in an amount equal to the insurance benefit payments that are made under a long-term care insurance policy, regardless of whether the policy was issued before the effective date of such plan amendment, if specified requirements are met. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promote the education of consumers regarding qualified state long-term care insurance partnerships."
