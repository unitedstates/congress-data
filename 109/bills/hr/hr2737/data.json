Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of OCPH, to carry out public health activities for individuals who are employees in federal, state, or local penal or correctional institutions or who are incarcerated in such institutions. Includes among such activities disease prevention, health promotion, service delivery, research, and health professions education activities. Authorizes the Secretary to make matching grants to states to provide for correctional populations screenings, immunizations, and treatment for hepatitis A, B, and C.
