Amends the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to require (by January 1, 2008) that all U.S. citizens and aliens carry and produce a passport when traveling into the United States (except as provided by this Act). Directs the Secretary of State to endeavor to persuade all countries to issue machine-readable passports which comply with document identifying standards established by the International Civil Aviation Organization."
