Prescribes a formula for determining the annual surplus of the Trust Funds. Prohibits disinvestment of Social Security Trust Fund amounts from public debt obligations, any refraining from making such investments, or any delay in making normal deposits in such Trust Funds for public debt limit-related purposes. Authorizes the sale of Social Security Trust Fund public debt obligations, despite the public debt limit, for the payment of cash benefits and administrative expenses."
