    "text": "Copyright Modernization Act of 2006 - Section 115 Reform Act of 2006 - Sets forth provisions governing compulsory licenses for digital phonorecord deliveries and hybrid offerings that cover the making and distribution of general and incidental digital phonorecord deliveries in the form of full downloads, limited downloads, interactive streams, and any other form constituting a digital phonorecord delivery or hybrid offering. Requires the Register of Copyrights to designate a General Designated Agent to grant and administer licenses and collect and distribute royalties payable for the use of musical works licensed under this Act. Orphan Works Act of 2006 - Limits the remedies available in a copyright infringement action if the infringer proves that: (1) the infringer performed and documented a reasonably diligent search in good faith to identify and locate the copyright owner before using the work, but was unable to locate the owner; and (2) the infringing use of the work provided attribution to the author and owner of the copyright, if known. Copyright Protection Resources Authorization Act of 2006 -Provides that a certificate of registration of a copyright satisfies the registration requirements even when it contains inaccurate information, unless: (1) the information was included on the application with knowledge that it was inaccurate; and (2) the inaccurate information, if known, would have caused the Register of Copyrights to refuse registration. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) create an operational unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to assist in the investigation and coordination of intellectual property crimes; and (2) create a task force to develop and implement a plan to investigate and prosecute international organized crime syndicates involved in theft of intellectual property."
