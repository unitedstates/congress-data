Defines \"windfall profit\" as the excess of taxpayer adjusted taxable income over the reasonably inflated average profit for the taxable year (average of taxpayer adjusted taxable income for 2000-2004, plus 10 percent of such average). Allows a tax deduction for the payment of any such windfall profit tax. Appropriates equal amounts of the windfall profit tax generated by this Act to carry out the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 and to increase funding for Department of Veterans Affairs medical services."
