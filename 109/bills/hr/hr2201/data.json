Amends the Truth in Lending Act to require credit card disclosures under an open end consumer credit plan to include an explanation of: (1) credit scores and the negative effects that low credit scores can have on the consumer; (2) how being over a credit limit hurts the consumer; and (3) how long it would take paying off a credit balance by just making the minimum payments required, and the effect that negative amortization may have in extending such time."
