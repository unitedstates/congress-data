Requires such coins to feature an image of: (1) the Declaration of Independence; (2) the Constitution of the United States; and (3) the Bill of Rights. Declares that: (1) only one U.S. Mint facility may be used to strike any particular combination of denomination and quality of such coins; and (2) the coins may be issued only during calendar 2010. Prescribes guidelines for coin sales and a coin surcharge."
