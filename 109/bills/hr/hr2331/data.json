Provides for standards for information control designations related to the classification of national security information, if needed. Revokes specified executive orders limiting access to presidential records. Requires publishing the names of Presidential interagency advisory committee members. Requires public disclosure of non-governmental committee contacts. Permits the Archivist to charge an agency a specified fee to cover costs required for activities of the Public Interest Declassification Board, if funds appropriated for the Board are insufficient. Restricts the availability of a record under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) pertaining to the vulnerability of and threats to critical infrastructure that is furnished voluntarily to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Amends the FOIA concerning additional matters to be included in agency reports to the Attorney General. Prohibits aggregating public information requests with information on individuals in reports. Amends the FOIA to permit assessing the United States reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case seeking information under any other Federal law in which the complainant has substantially prevailed."
