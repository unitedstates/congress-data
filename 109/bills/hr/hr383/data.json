Requires the general plan to include proposals for a comprehensive interpretive program of the Route. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the NPS Director, to administer a program for interpretation of the Route. Authorizes the Secretary to provide other federal, state, tribal, and local nonprofit or private entities with technical assistance in developing interpretive devices and materials with respect to sites linked by segments of the Route administered by such entities. Instructs the Secretary to ensure that the Route is marked with appropriate signs and other markers to guide the public. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to require any private property owner to allow public access (including federal, state, or local government access) to such private property, or to modify any provision of federal, state, or local law with regard to public access to or use of private lands. Authorizes appropriations."
