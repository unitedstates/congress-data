    "text": "Senior Independence Act of 2006 - (Sec. 2) Reauthorizes the Older Americans Act of 1965. Revises the definition of \"information and assistance service\" to include such a service for older individuals at risk for institutional placement. Defines the term \"elder justice\" to mean effort to prevent, detect, treat, intervene in, and respond to elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation and to protect elders with diminished capacity while maximizing their autonomy. (Sec. 3) Authorizes the Assistant Secretary for Aging to designate within the Administration on Aging responsibility for elder abuse prevention and services. Assigns to the Assistant Secretary the duty of developing objectives, priorities, policy, and a plan for: (1) carrying out elder justice programs; (2) collecting and disseminating data relating to the abuse, neglect, and exploitation of older individuals (abuse); (3) disseminating information concerning best practices regarding, and providing training on, activities related to such abuse; (4) researching such abuse; (5) providing technical assistance to states and other entities; (6) assisting states and other entities in developing strategic plans to better coordinate elder justice activities, research, and training; and (7) promoting collaborative efforts and diminishing duplicative efforts in elder justice programs in all levels of government. Authorizes the Assistant Secretary to designate an officer to be responsible for the administration of mental health services authorized under this Act. Establishes the duty of the Assistant Secretary to develop objectives, priorities, and a long-term plan for supporting state and local efforts involving education, prevention, detection, and treatment of mental disorders, including age-related dementia, depression, and Alzheimer's disease and related neurological disorders. (Sec. 4) Adds as functions of the Administration on Aging: (1) providing assistance in the establishment and implementation of assistive technology services programs for older individuals; (2) coordinating activities with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and other federal entities to implement and build awareness of programs for older individuals; (3) providing technical assistance to service providers in informing older individuals with greatest economic need of the eligibility requirements for supplemental security income benefits, medical assistance, and benefits under the Food Stamp Act of 1977; (4) providing technical assistance and support for efforts to inform and enroll older individuals in programs for which they are eligible; (5) designing and implementing procedures for collecting information about services needed by older individuals, including services that would permit such individuals to receive long-term care in home and community-based settings; and (6) providing information and technical assistance to states, area agencies on aging, and service providers to support the effort to make available evidence-based disease prevention and health promotion services.
