    "text": "Henry J. Hyde United Nations Reform Act of 2005 - States that it is incumbent upon the United Nations to enact significant reform measures in order to restore the public trust and confidence necessary to achieve the laudable goals set forth in its Charter. Title I: Mission and Budget of the United Nations - (Sec. 101) States that it shall be U.S. policy to use its influence at the United Nations to pursue an efficient and accountable U.N. regular assessed budget, and shift funding mechanisms for the following U.N. programs from the regular assessed budget to voluntarily funded programs: (1) economic and social affairs; (2) least-developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing countries; (3) U.N. support for the New Partnership for Africa's Development; (4) trade and development; (5) International Trade Center UNCTAD/WTO; (6) environment; (7) human settlements; (8) crime prevention and criminal justice; (9) international drug control; (10) economic and social development in Africa; (11) economic and social development in Asia and the Pacific; (12) economic development in Europe; (13) economic and social development in Latin America and the Caribbean; (14) economic and social development in Western Asia; (15) regular program of technical cooperation; (16) development account; (17) protection of and assistance to refugees; and (18) Palestine refugees. States that it shall be U.S. policy to: (1) redirect U.S. contributions to the United Nations to achieve such policy objectives; and (2) redirect a portion of Public Information and General Assembly funds to pursue budget efficiency and accountability goals. States that it shall be US policy to use its influence at the United Nations to: (1) ensure that future U.N. biennial budgets reflect such policies; (2) enforce zero nominal growth in all assessed dues to the regular budget of the United Nations and its agencies and programs; (3) enforce the 5.6 rule at the United Nations, requiring the Secretariat to identify low-priority activities in the budget proposal; (4) ensure the United Nations is annually publishing a list of all subsidiary bodies and their functions, budgets, and staff; and (5) ensure that the difference between the scale of assessments for the five permanent Security Council members is not greater than five times that of any other permanent member of the Security Council, and if a permanent member with veto power is not in compliance with such requirement, the US Permanent Representative to the United Nations should use U.S. influence to deny veto power to such member. Amends the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 to direct the US Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use U.S. influence to implement such policies, including the withholding of U.S. consensus for the biennial budget until the budget reflects such policies. Maintains the 22% limit on annual U.S. contributions to the U.N. regular assessed budget. States that if one or more of such programs have not been redirected to voluntary funded programs by 2008, the amount of funds assessed to the United States for such programs shall be redirected, subject to congressional notification, as follows: (1) not more than 40% of the funds shall be redirected to internal oversight programs, human rights programs, humanitarian assistance programs, and 16 of the 18 programs (the two excluded programs are refugee assistance and Palestine refugees); and (2) the remaining amounts to voluntarily funded U.N. specialized agencies, funds, or programs. Authorizes the Secretary, subject to congressional notification, to make voluntary contributions to such 16 programs, not to exceed ten percent of the 40% total. Directs the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations to make efforts to reduce budgets (10% from the 2004-2005 budget for 2007, and 20% from the 2004-2005 budget for the 2008-2009 and subsequent biennial periods) for the Public Information and the General Assembly Affairs and Conference programs. Requires: (1) 20% US assessment redirection if the 2007 reduction is not achieved; and (2) certification that the reductions have been achieved for 2008-2009 and subsequent periods. Prohibits the Secretary from making a contribution to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in an amount greater than the highest contribution to UNRWA made by an Arab country, but may not exceed 22% of UNRWA's total budget. (Defines an Arab country for such purpose as Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Dijibouti, Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, and Yemen.) (Sec. 102) States that it shall be U.S. policy to pursue weighted voting with respect to all budgetary and financial matters in the Administrative and Budgetary Committee and in the General Assembly in accordance with the level of a member's financial contribution to the U.N. regular assessed budget. (Sec. 103) Sets forth U.N. budget certification requirements respecting: (1) budget maintenance not in excess of of the level agreed to by the General Assembly unless increases are agreed to by consensus and do not exceed 10%; (2) identification of expenditures by functional category; (3) requiring program managers to follow performance-based budgeting and program evaluation; and (4) requiring that all new programs approved by the General Assembly have a sunset date.

(Sec. 105) Directs the President to direct the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use U.S. influence to work toward General Assembly adoption of: (1) a definition of terrorism that includes any action intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do, or abstain from doing, any act; and (2) a comprehensive convention on terrorism that includes such definition.

States that: (1) if at least 32 of the reforms have been implemented all reforms shall be considered to have been implemented for the year of certification; and (2) if the remaining reforms have not been implemented by the next year the 50% withholding provision shall apply. Specifies 15 reforms required to be among such 32 reforms, including: (1) 20% reductions for Public Information and General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services budgets; (2) annual budget level maintenance; (3) new program sunset provisions; (4) an Independent Oversight Board; (5) a United Nations Office of Ethics; (6) U.N. human rights body ineligibility for a member country failing to uphold the values of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, or under Security Council sanction or investigation for human rights abuses; (7) barring any U.N. human rights body from having a standing agenda item that relates only to one country or region; (8) Economic and Social Council secret voting abolishment; and (9) Commission on Human Rights membership."
