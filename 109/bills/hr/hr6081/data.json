Establishes the Federal Engineering Accountability Commission to determine the Corps' failure or negligence after such a disaster and to report to the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of Homeland Security. Permits such an action for injury, loss of property, personal injury, or death to proceed only if a claimant can demonstrate that: (1) the Corps admitted that it failed or was negligent; or (2) the Commission determines that the Corps failed or was negligent."
