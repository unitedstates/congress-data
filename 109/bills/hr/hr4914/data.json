    "text": "Veterans' Choice of Representation Act - Amends federal law concerning a veteran's representation by an agent or attorney to allow the payment of attorney fees from the date the claimant files a Notice of Disagreement in the case. (Currently, such fees may not be paid before the Board of Veterans' Appeals first makes a final decision in the case.) Repeals the requirement that, in order to be paid, an attorney must be retained within a one-year period after the case has begun. Authorizes: (1) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to review an attorney's fee agreement and order a reduction if the Secretary finds that the fee is excessive or unreasonable; and (2) judicial review of such findings. Requires (currently, authorizes) the Secretary to direct the payment of attorney fees out of any past-due benefits awarded to a veteran in a proceeding."
