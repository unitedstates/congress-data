Declares that there is no more capable soldier than the citizen-soldiers of the Guard. Reaffirms the critical role of the Guard in defending the United States, carrying out combat missions, responding to domestic emergencies and disasters, and securing the homeland. Recognizes the importance of the Guard in ensuring a connection between the military and local communities. Opposes any attempt to reduce the role of the Guard within the Total Force concept of the Armed Forces. Directs the President to begin the redeployment of U.S. Armed Forces from Iraq, starting with the orderly redeployment of Guard units."
