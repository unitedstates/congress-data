Prohibits: (1) providing or using such grants in a manner that reduces the financial responsibility of any nongovernmental party that is responsible or potentially responsible for contamination on any real property; and (2) the provision of assistance pursuant to this section from in any way relieving any party of liability with respect to such contamination, including liability for removal and remediation costs. Authorizes FY2006-FY2010 appropriations. Defines \"brownfield site\" for purposes of this section. Makes brownfields-related environmental cleanup and economic development activities eligible for community development block grant (CDBG) assistance. Authorizes CDBG use to administer renewal communities."
