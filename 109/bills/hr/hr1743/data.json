    "text": "Directs the President to ensure publication in the Federal Register of all U.S. and foreign entities that have invested more than $20 million in Iran's energy sector between August 5, 1996, and the date of such publication. Requires such list to include an itemization of individual investments of each such entity. Expresses the sense of Congress that, upon such publication, managers of federal pension plans or thrift savings plans, managers of pension plans maintained in the private sector by plan sponsors in the United States, and managers of mutual funds sold or distributed in the United States should immediately initiate efforts to divest all investments of such plans or funds in any entity included on the list. Expresses the sense of Congress that, upon such publication, there should be no future investment in any entity included on the list by managers of U.S. Government pension plans or thrift savings plans, managers of pension plans maintained in the private sector by plan sponsors in the United States, and managers of mutual funds sold or distributed in the United States. Requires disclosure to investors that their funds are invested in an entity included on such list. Requires the Office of Global Security Risks to issue a report listing the U.S. and foreign entities identified in accordance with the relevant Federal Register, including a determination of whether or not: (1) their operations in Iran constitute a risk to the United States; and (2) the entity faces U.S. litigation, sanctions, or similar circumstances that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on the financial condition or operations of the entity."
