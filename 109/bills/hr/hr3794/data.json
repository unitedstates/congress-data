Provides: (1) that for the first six months after enactment of this Act the Secretary may not dispose of such properties except to an eligible family; (2) that for the 18 months following such six month period the Secretary shall make such properties that are not under a disposition agreement available to eligible families; (3) for five-year rent free occupancy, with an option to purchase; and (4) program outreach activities. Directs the Secretary to establish selection criteria for a property for which more than one family has submitted a request, with preference for families having incomes not exceeding the median income for the area in which the family's primary residence was located."
