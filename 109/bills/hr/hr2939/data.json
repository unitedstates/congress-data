Establishes national standards to require any federal agency or federally funded activities that affect U.S. ocean waters or ocean resources to be conducted in a manner that protects and maintains healthy marine ecosystems and, where appropriate, restores degraded marine ecosystems. Reestablishes in the Department of Commerce (what already exists under Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), administered by the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere (Administrator). Directs the President to submit to Congress recommendations on, and a plan and proposed schedule for, the transfer of oceanic or atmospheric programs, functions, services, and associated resources to NOAA from other federal agencies. Establishes: (1) a National Oceans Advisor; (2) a Committee on Ocean Policy; and (3) the Council of Advisors on Oceans Policy. Designates certain ocean regions for ecosystem-based management. Establishes a Regional Ocean Partnership for each designated ocean region. Requires each Partnership to prepare a Regional Ocean Strategic Plan for each ocean region. Establishes a Committee on Ocean Science, Education, and Operations (OSEO Committee). Directs the Chair of the Committee on Ocean Policy to develop a National Strategy for Ocean and Coastal Science. Establishes: (1) a Subcommittee on Ocean Education within the OSEO Committee; (2) an interagency ocean and coastal education program; (3) a National Marine Scholarship Program; and (4) a NOAA Office of Education. Establishes: (1) an Office of Ocean Exploration within the Ocean and Atmospheric Research and Data Services Office; and (2) a Subcommittee on Ocean Exploration within the OSEO Committee. Establishes in the Treasury the Ocean and Great Lakes Conservation Trust Fund."
