Requires the Council to establish an interagency program office (Oceanus) responsible for program planning and coordination of the system. Requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to be the lead Federal agency for system implementation and operation. Makes regional associations responsible for the development and operation of regional coastal and ocean observing systems to meet the information needs of user groups in the region while adhering to national standards. Deems certified regional systems to be part of NOAA when carrying out this Act, and employees of such systems acting within the scope of their employment to be Federal Government employees, for purposes of civil liability under specified laws. Directs the Council to establish programs for research, development, and education for the system. Authorizes departments and agencies represented on the Council to participate in interagency financing and to share funds appropriated to any Council member."
