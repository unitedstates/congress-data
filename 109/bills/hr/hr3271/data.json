    "text": "Trade Agreement Enforcement Act - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to create in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) the position of Deputy U.S. Trade Representative for Trade Enforcement to ensure compliance with trade agreements relating to U.S. manufactured goods and services. Grants the Deputy authority to investigate and recommend prosecuting cases before the World Trade Organization (WTO) and under trade agreements to which the United States is a party. Requires the Deputy to: (1) identify foreign government barriers to U.S. goods and services that are at odds with current trade agreements; and (2) perform such other functions as the USTR may direct. Authorizes appropriations without fiscal year limitations for the Deputy to hire 100 additional trade enforcement investigators to be assigned to foreign nations to aid the Deputy in investigating such potential cases. Requires the Deputy to report annually to specified congressional committees on non-tariff trade barriers affecting market access for U.S. companies to markets in: (1) the European Union; (2) the People's Republic of China; (3) Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua; (4) India; (5) Brazil; and (6) Mexico. Focuses such report on manufacturing in goods, intellectual property piracy, sanitary standards, and telecommunications access."
