Requires the code of conduct, to the maximum extent practicable, to be consistent with the following six core principles of the United Nations (UN) Inter-Agency Standing Committee Task Force on Protection From Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in Humanitarian Crises: (1) sexual exploitation and abuse by humanitarian workers constitute acts of gross misconduct and are therefore grounds for termination of employment; (2) sexual activity with children (persons under the age of 18) is prohibited regardless of the local age of majority or consent; (3) exchange of money, employment, goods, or services for sex, including sexual favors or other forms of humiliating or exploitative behavior, is prohibited; (4) sexual relationships between humanitarian workers and beneficiaries are strongly discouraged; (5) where a humanitarian worker develops concerns or suspicions regarding sexual abuse or exploitation by a fellow worker he or she must report such concerns via established agency reporting mechanisms; and (6) humanitarian agencies are obliged to maintain an environment which prevents sexual exploitation and abuse and promotes the implementation of their code of conduct."
