    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "2006-03-30", 
    "text": "Universal Service Reform Act of 2006 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 concerning procedures for the review of universal service requirements to require the Federal-State Joint Board on universal service to complete recommendations for changes to such requirements within 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act. Includes high-speed broadband services within universal service. Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to assess contributions to universal service support mechanisms from communications service providers, allowing a limit on the contributions of providers whose customers typically make a low volume of monthly calls. Provides: (1) support contribution limits; and (2) support to non-rural carriers providing service in rural, insular, and high-cost areas. Outlines network traffic identification accountability standards, rulemaking, and enforcement requirements. Requires the FCC, within 180 days after the enactment of this Act, to prescribe regulations that require a provider, upon a bona fide request, to provide communications services necessary for the provision of health care services in a state to any health care provider that serves persons who live in rural areas of that state. Outlines eligibility requirements for communications service providers to receive universal service support, including (with a possible three-year waiver) that the provider meets basic requirements for the deployment and provision of high-speed broadband service. Makes current limitations on universal service support and individual support caps imposed upon carriers inapplicable after the date of enactment of this Act. Requires all residential and business lines served by an eligible telecommunications carrier to be eligible for federal universal service support."
