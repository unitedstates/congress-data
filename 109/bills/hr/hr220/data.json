Prohibits the Social Security Administration from divulging the Social Security account number of an individual to any Federal, State, or local government agency or instrumentality, or to any other individual. Amends the Privacy Act of 1974 to prohibit any Federal, State, or local government agency or instrumentality from requesting an individual to disclose his Social Security account number on either a mandatory or a voluntary basis. Prohibits any two Federal agencies or instrumentalities from implementing the same identifying number with respect to any individual (except as authorized by the Social Security Act). Prohibits any Federal agency from: (1) establishing or mandating a uniform standard for identification of an individual that is required to be used by any other Federal or State agency, or by a private person, for any purpose other than that of conducting the authorized activities of the standard-establishing or -mandating Federal agency; or (2) conditioning receipt of any Federal grant, contract, or other Federal funding on the adoption, by a State or local government, or by a State agency, of such a uniform standard."
