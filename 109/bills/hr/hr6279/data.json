Requires the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor to make specified revisions to the procedures and methodologies related to its collection and disaggregation of data relating to mass layoffs, relocations, and employment. Requires the Bureaus to study and report jointly to Congress on whether linking or coordinating their independent data relating to mass layoffs and import and export services transactions would improve the quality of information available about outsourcing and off-shoring of private sector business operations and services."
