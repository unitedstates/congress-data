Prohibits: (1) the Secretary, in accepting such services of individuals as volunteers, from permitting the use of such volunteers in law enforcement work, in regulatory and enforcement work, in policy-making processes, or to displace any employee; and (2) volunteer services authorized by this Act from being conducted on private property unless the officer or employee charged with supervising the volunteer obtains appropriate consent to enter the property from the property owner. Authorizes the Secretary to accept the services of individuals in hazardous duty only upon a determination by the Secretary that such individuals are skilled in performing hazardous activities. Directs the Secretary to ensure that an appropriate US officer or employee provides adequate and appropriate supervision of each volunteer whose services the Secretary accepts. Authorizes the Secretary to provide for services and costs incidental to the utilization of volunteers. Provides that a volunteer shall neither be deemed a federal employee nor subject to federal employment law, including those provisions relating to hours of work, rates of compensation, leave, unemployment compensation, and federal employee benefits. Subjects volunteers to criminal law provisions concerning bribery, graft, and conflicts of interest, except under certain conditions."
