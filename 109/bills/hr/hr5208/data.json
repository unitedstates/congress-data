Amends the Clean Air Act to: (1) increase the applicable volume of renewable fuel for calendar years 2008-2012 that must be part of gasoline in the United States (except in noncontiguous states or territories); and (2) increase the number of gallons of renewable fuel in the calculation used to determine the required volume of renewable fuel in gasoline for calendar years 2013 and thereafter."
