Requires the Secretary to consult with the Invasive Species Advisory Committee on: (1) the projects proposed for such grants; and (2) regarding the development of a database concerning control projects carried out with such grants. Authorizes the Secretary to provide financial assistance to enable an immediate response to outbreaks of harmful nonnative species that threaten or may negatively impact refuge resources that are at a stage at which rapid eradication or control is possible, and to ensure eradication or immediate control of such species. Directs the Secretary to establish a Cooperative Volunteer Invasives Monitoring and Control Program to document and combat invasive species in national wildlife refuges."
