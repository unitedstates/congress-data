    "text": "Comprehensive Medical Malpractice Reform Act of 2005 - Limits the non-economic damages that an individual may recover from a health care provider for an injury or death as the result of health care malpractice to $250,000 as adjusted for inflation from 1975. Requires a medical malpractice action to be dismissed unless the signer of complaint certifies its validity. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) develop voluntary performance standards applicable to state medical boards; and (2) establish an interstate patient reporting and physician tracking database. Directs the Attorney General to make grants to states and health care entities to carry out mediation programs to resolve health care malpractice allegations without litigation. Amends the Public Health Service Act to provide for the voluntary disclosure of patient safety information to patient safety organizations. Makes such information privileged. Directs the Secretary to establish a database to receive relevant non-identifiable patient safety information. Limits the liability of a health care provider that provides information to a state medical board regarding the competence or professional conduct of a physician."
