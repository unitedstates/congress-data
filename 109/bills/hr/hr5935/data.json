Requires a specified adjustment to the reduction of Medicare resident positions for rural and small urban hospitals, where that reduction was based on a cost report subsequently settled, whether as a result of an appeal or otherwise, if the reference resident level under such settled cost report is higher than the resident level used for the reduction."
