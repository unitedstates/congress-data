    "text": "Prescription Drug Abuse Elimination Act of 2006 -Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require Internet pharmacies to meet specified criteria, including: (1) providing individuals who access the pharmacy with certain information; (2) obtaining verification of a valid prescription in some circumstances; and (3) providing contact information of the individual dispensing prescription drugs on the site to each state that licenses or authorizes the person to dispense drugs. Prohibits the sale of a prescription drug, or the ownership or operation of an illegal Internet pharmacy, in violation of the requirements of this Act. Allows district courts to order Internet providers to remove access or links to sites that violate this Act. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate chain-of-custody requirements to track prescription drugs from the manufacturer through each importer, distributor, and retailer. Deems a drug misbranded if such requirements are not met. Amends the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act to restrict the importation of a schedule II, III, or IV drug by a U.S. resident without a valid prescription to once during any 30-day period. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, to: (1) convene a working group to study and report on pharmaceutical counterfeiting; and (2) study the best methods to ensure that controlled substances are not diverted for unlawful use. Requires the Secretary to conduct research and report on issues related to prescription drug abuse. Requires the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to maintain a comprehensive, national database on deaths occurring as a result of substance abuse."
