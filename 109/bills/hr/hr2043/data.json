Prohibits the temporary increase from: (1) increasing or decreasing the permanent membership of the House; (2) affecting the basis of reappointment established by Federal law; or (3) being taken into account in determining the number of electors with respect to the 2008 Presidential election. Amends the District of Columbia Delegate Act to eliminate the office of District of Columbia Delegate. Amends the District of Columbia Statehood Constitutional Convention Initiative of 1979 to eliminate the office of Statehood Representative."
