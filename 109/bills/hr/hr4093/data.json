Amends the Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 to extend for five years a specified temporary judgeship relating to the northern district of Ohio. Amends the federal judicial code and the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands to establish a federal judicial district in the Virgin Islands, and revise requirements relating to the jurisdiction of courts there. Title II: Bankruptcy Judgeships - Enhanced Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2005 - Authorizes and requires: (1) additional permanent and temporary bankruptcy judgeships in specified states; and (2) the conversion of certain existing temporary bankruptcy judgeships into permanent bankruptcy judgeships. Expresses the sense of the Congress that bankruptcy judges in the eastern district of California should conduct bankruptcy proceedings on a daily basis in Bakersfield, California. Title III: Ninth Circuit Reorganization- Judicial Administration and Improvements Act of 2005 - Amends the federal judicial code to divide the ninth judicial circuit into the new ninth judicial circuit (to be composed of California, Guam, Hawaii, and the Northern Mariana Islands) and the twelfth circuit (to be composed of Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington.) Sets the number of circuit judges for the ninth circuit at 19, and the number for the twelfth circuit at 14. Specifies the locations where the new circuits shall hold regular sessions. Prescribes requirements for the disposition of cases pending in the former ninth circuit prior to the effective date of this Act. Authorizes the temporary assignment of circuit and district court judges of the former ninth circuit among the new circuits. Allows the senior circuit judge of the former ninth circuit to elect assignment to the new ninth or to the twelfth circuit. Declares that the former ninth circuit shall cease to exist for administrative purposes two years after the enactment of this Act. Title IV: Authorization of Appropriations - Authorizes appropriations for FY2006-FY2009 to carry out this Act."
