    "text": "USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 - Title I: USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act - (Sec. 102) Repeals the sunset date for (thus making permanent) the surveillance provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act, with the following exceptions. Provides for a four-year extension (through December 31, 2009) of provisions: (1) granting roving surveillance authority under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) where the Court finds that the actions of the target may thwart the identification of a specified person; and (2) authorizing the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to apply for a court order requiring production of tangible things (including books, records, papers, and documents) for foreign intelligence and international terrorism investigations. (Sec. 103) Amends the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to: (1) extend for four years (through December 31, 2009) provisions revising the definition of an \"agent of a foreign power\" to include any non-U.S. person who engages in international terrorism or preparatory activities (thus permitting issuance of FISA orders targeting such persons without a showing that they are members or agents of a terrorist group or a foreign power [\"lone wolf\" provision]); and (2) repeal the sunset date for provisions setting forth additions to the offense of providing material support to terrorists. (Sec. 105) Amends FISA to apply provisions governing the duration of an order for electronic surveillance or a physical search to surveillance targeted against a foreign power who is not a U.S. person. Limits to one year an order (or extension) for the use of pen registers and trap and trace devices where the applicant has certified that the information likely to be obtained is foreign intelligence information not concerning a U.S. person. (Sec. 106) Amends the FISA provisions governing orders for the production of tangible things to authorize the Director of the FBI to delegate to the Deputy Director or the Executive Assistant Director for National Security the authority to make an application for such an order involving library circulation records, library patron lists, book sales records, book customer lists, firearms sales records, tax return records, educational records, or medical records containing information that would identify a person. Requires an application for such an order to: (1) include a statement of facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the tangible things sought are relevant to an authorized investigation; (2) include an enumeration of minimization procedures adopted by the Attorney General that are applicable to the retention and dissemination by the FBI of any tangible things produced; and (3) describe the tangible things to be produced with sufficient particularity to permit them to be fairly identified. Sets forth provisions concerning review by a panel of three judges of petitions filed by recipients challenging an order's legality. Requires the Attorney General to report to specified congressional committees annually on requests and order applications for the production of tangible things and semiannually on orders for the production of library circulation records, library patron lists, book sales records, book customer lists, firearms sales records, tax return records, educational records, and medical records that would identify a person. (Sec. 106A) Directs the Inspector General of the Department of Justice (DOJ) to perform and report to Congress on a comprehensive audit of the effectiveness and use of the investigative authority provided to the FBI under FISA. (Sec. 107) Requires the Attorney General to submit to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees an annual report containing accounts from which DOJ has received voluntary disclosures of customer communications or records in emergencies involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury. (Sec. 108) Requires applications for roving wiretaps to include specific facts. Requires an order approving electronic surveillance where the nature and location are unknown to direct the applicant to provide notice to the court, within 10 days after the surveillance begins, of: (1) the nature and location of each new facility or place at which the electronic surveillance is directed; (2) the facts and circumstances relied upon to justify the belief that such facility is or was being used by the target of the surveillance; (3) any proposed minimization procedures that may be necessitated by a change in the facility; and (4) the total number of electronic surveillances conducted under the authority of the order. Directs the Attorney General to inform the House and Senate Judiciary Committees semiannually concerning electronic surveillance under FISA, including regarding: (1) electronic surveillance orders where the nature and location of each targeted facility are unknown; (2) criminal cases in which information acquired has been authorized for use at trial; and (3) emergency employments of electronic surveillance. (Sec. 109) Requires the Attorney General to inform such Committees regarding: (1) emergency physical searches authorized; and (2) pen registers and trap and trace devices authorized on an emergency basis. Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to report to the Judiciary Committees semiannually on internal affairs operations at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, including regarding investigations conducted. (Sec. 110) Amends the federal criminal code to rewrite provisions prohibiting acts of destruction and violence against trains, railroad equipment and structures, and the mass transportation system to: (1) correspond with current prohibitions against acts of violence against the mass transportation system; (2) apply such provisions to acts committed knowingly (currently, willfully); (3) cover such acts against passenger vessels; and (4) add as an aggravated offense the commission of such prohibited act under circumstances in which the railroad on-track equipment, passenger vessel, or mass transportation vehicle was carrying high-level radioactive waste, spent nuclear fuel, or specified hazardous material. Prohibits surveilling, photographing, videotaping, diagramming, or otherwise collecting information with the intent to plan specified terrorist acts against mass transportation systems. Provides for the death penalty where the offense results in the death of any person. (Sec. 111) Provides for the civil forfeiture of any property traceable to proceeds obtained from, or used to facilitate, trafficking in nuclear, chemical, biological, or radiological weapons technology or material. (Sec. 112) Includes as a predicate offense to a \"federal crime of terrorism\" a crime related to: (1) military-type training from a foreign terrorist organization; or (2) narco-terrorism. (Sec. 113) Expands the circumstances under which the interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications is authorized to cover offenses related to: (1) biological weapons; (2) violence at international airports; (3) animal enterprise terrorism; (4) nuclear and weapons of mass destruction threats; (5) explosive materials; (6) possession of weapons in federal facilities; (7) U.S. officers and employees; (8) protection of foreign officials; (9) terrorist attacks against mass transportation; (10) torture; (11) arson within special maritime and territorial jurisdiction; (12) conspiracy to harm persons or property overseas; (13) structuring financial transactions to evade reporting requirements; (14) aircraft piracy; (15) assault on a flight crew with a dangerous weapon; (16) explosive or incendiary devices, or endangerment of human life, by means of weapons on aircraft; (17) aggravated identity theft; and (18) certain antitrust criminal violations. (Sec. 114) Authorizes the delay of notice of the execution of a search warrant for a reasonable period not to exceed 30 days after execution or until a later date if the facts justify a longer delay. Requires the issuing or denying judge to report to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts regarding warrants authorizing delayed notice or denials of warrants and requires the Director of the Administrative Office to report annually to Congress. (Sec. 115) Authorizes the recipient of a request for records in connection with an authorized investigation concerning terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA), or the National Security Act of 1947 (NSA) (a national security letter) to petition the U.S. district court for the district in which that person or entity does business or resides for an order modifying or setting aside the request. Permits the court to modify or set aside the request if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive. Sets forth procedures for petitions for an order modifying or setting aside a nondisclosure requirement imposed in connection with such a request. Authorizes the court to modify or set aside the requirement if it finds that there is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger U.S. national security, interfere with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation, interfere with diplomatic relations, or endanger the life or physical safety of any person. Treats a certification made by the Attorney General, the Director of the FBI, or the head of a federal department that disclosure may endanger national security or interfere with diplomatic relations as conclusive unless the court finds it was made in bad faith. Authorizes the Attorney General to invoke the aid of a U.S. court to compel compliance with a request for information. (Sec. 116) Prohibits disclosure of such a request if the Director of the FBI certifies that otherwise there may result a danger to U.S. national security, interference with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation, interference with diplomatic relations, or danger to the life or physical safety of any person. Requires a person, at the request of the Director of the FBI, to identify the person to whom a disclosure was or will be made. (Sec. 117) Sets penalties for knowing violations of nondisclosure provisions under the federal criminal code, FCRA, RFPA, or NSA.
