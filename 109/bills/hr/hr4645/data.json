Permits Medicare beneficiaries enrolled under prescription drug plans suspended under this Act to enroll under other plans during the period of suspension. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on each anti-fraud and abuse provision (including related intermediate sanctions) applicable to an MA-PD plan or a Medicare prescription drug plan, and assess its effectiveness and the overall compliance of such plans."
