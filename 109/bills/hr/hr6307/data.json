Requires the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on how federal benefits provided to beneficiaries in each state under certain programs would be distributed if: (1) the cost of living in each state, as determined under the methodology, were a factor in the determination of such benefits; and (2) the methodology were applied so that federal benefits vary only to the extent that such determination would result in an increase of benefits to beneficiaries in a state. Specifies such benefit programs as all those providing vouchers, coupons, cash grants, or cash reimbursements based on the beneficiary's income."
