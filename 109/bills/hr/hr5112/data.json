Outlines the authorities and responsibilities of the Director of the Office of Government Ethics with regard to such reports. Sets prohibitions on covered executive branch officials who are entering or leaving government service. Amends the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act to modify provisions relating to procurement officials. Sets a prohibition on the personal and substantial involvement by certain former contractor employees in the award or administration of government contracts. Sets a prohibition on unauthorized expenditure of funds for publicity or propaganda purposes. Requires an advertisement or other communication paid for by an executive agency to disclose that such advertisement or communication is paid for by that agency. Directs each federal agency to submit to the Archivist of the United States and specified congressional committees a report describing the use of \"pseudo\" classification designations. Requires the Archivist to: (1) report on the use of \"pseudo\" classification designations; and (2) promulgate regulations banning \"pseudo\" classification designations. Prohibits an employee or applicant for employment of a covered agency from being discriminated against as a reprisal for disclosing covered information to an authorized Member of Congress or to an authorized official of an executive agency, the Department of Justice, or the Inspector General of the employee's employing covered agency."
