    "text": "Efficient Energy Through Certified Technologies and Electricity Reliability (EFFECTER) Act of 2005 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide tax incentives affecting: (1) energy efficient commercial building property; (2) new energy efficient homes; (3) certain energy efficient property used in business; (4) nonbusiness energy property; and (5) combined heat and power system property. Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to expand the scope of consumer products that fall within the Energy Conservation Program (other than automobiles), including: (1) vending machines and commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment; and (2) commercial refrigerators, freezers, and refrigerator-freezers. Directs the Federal Trade Commission to initiate a rulemaking regarding: (1) the effectiveness of the consumer products labeling program in assisting consumers to make purchasing decisions and to improve energy efficiency; and (2) changes to the labeling rules that would improve the effectiveness of consumer product labels. Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to prescribe guidelines under which the head of an executive agency shall procure either an Energy Star product or a Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP)-designated product in order to meet agency requirements for an energy consuming product. Repeals the termination of authority to enter into new energy savings performance contracts (thereby making such authority permanent). Amends the Energy Conservation and Production Act to direct the Secretary of Energy to establish certain revised Federal building energy efficiency performance standards. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to include within the mandatory activities funded by the Capital Fund: (1) installing fixtures and fittings to improve energy and water-use efficiency; and (2) integrated utility management and capital planning to maximize energy conservation and efficiency measures. Amends the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act to direct the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate energy efficiency standards for rehabilitation and new construction of certain public and assisted housing. Amends the Federal Power Act to grant the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) jurisdiction over the FERC-certified Electric Reliability Organization, including any regional entities, and all users, owners and operators of the bulk-power system for purposes of approving specified reliability standards."
