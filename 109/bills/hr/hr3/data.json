(Sec. 1116) Directs the Secretary to apportion funds under this Act for the Appalachian development highway system for FY2005-FY2009 among the States based on the latest available cost-to-complete estimate for the system. (Sec. 1117) Directs the Secretary to establish a comprehensive program to address the relationships among transportation, community, and system preservation plans and practices and identify private sector-based initiatives to improve such relationships. Requires the Secretary to allocate funds to states, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), local governments, and tribal governments to carry out eligible projects to integrate transportation, community, and system preservation plans and practices. Authorizes appropriations for FY2005-FY2009. (Sec. 1118) Amends federal highway law to revise requirements of the territorial highway program to make program funds available to the U.S. territories for: (1) surface transportation program projects; and (2) ferry boats, terminal facilities, and approaches. (Sec. 1119) Authorizes a state in which a proposed federal-aid project is to be undertaken by a federal agency in accordance with an agreement between a state and the federal agency to direct the Secretary to transfer the funds for the federal share of the project directly to the federal agency. Requires the Secretary on October 1 of each fiscal year to allocate sums appropriated for forest development roads and trails according to the relative needs of the various grasslands (as well as, under current law, national forests). Requires the Secretary of the Interior to distribute Indian reservation road funds, within 30 days after availability, and for immediate use, to Indian tribes in accordance with the distribution formula under the Indian reservation roads program. Limits the use of such funds to projects identified in a transportation improvement program approved by the Secretary. Earmarks a portion of funds for Indian reservation roads for FY2006-FY2009 for program management, oversight, and project-related administrative expenses. Authorizes an Indian tribe to commence road and bridge construction with Indian reservation road funds if it provides assurances that the construction will meet or exceed applicable health and safety standards. Directs the Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior, to complete, and report to Congress, a national inventory of tribal transportation facilities eligible for assistance under the Indian reservation roads program. Authorizes appropriations for FY2005-FY2009 to carry out planning, design, engineering, preconstruction, construction, and inspection of projects to improve deficient Indian reservation road bridges, including multiple-pipe culverts.

Earmarks an amount of public lands highway funds for each fiscal year for: (1) maintenance of forest highways; (2) signage identifying public public hunting and fishing access; and (3) the costs of facilitating the passage of aquatic species beneath National Forest System roads, including costs of constructing, maintaining, replacing, or removing culverts and bridges. Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on methods to reduce collisions between motor vehicles and wildlife. Requires the Secretary, based on the study results, to develop a best practices manual to support state efforts to reduce wildlife vehicle collisions. (Sec. 1120) Directs the Secretary to allocate funds for FY2005-FY2009 for the Puerto Rico highway program. Sets forth a formula for the apportionment of such funds to Puerto Rico. (Sec 1121) Requires a state agency with jurisdiction over the operation of a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) facility to establish occupancy requirements for vehicles of at least two occupants per vehicle. Requires such agency to permit motorcycles and bicycles to use the HOV facility, unless such use would constitute a safety hazard. Prescribes guidelines under which a state agency may permit use of an HOV facility by: (1) public transportation vehicles and high occupancy toll vehicles; and (2) inherently low-emission vehicles and low emission and energy-efficient vehicles. Permits tolls to be charged on a HOV facility on the Interstate System. Requires a state agency that allows low-emission and energy-efficient vehicles to use a HOV facility to certify to the Secretary that it will establish: (1) a continuous monitoring, assessment, and reporting program regarding the impact of such vehicles on the facility and adjacent highways; and (2) an enforcement program that ensures the facility is operated in accordance with this Act. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to issue a final rule establishing certification requirements for low-emission and energy-efficient vehicles and for making certain vehicle comparisons and performance calculations. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary and the states should provide additional incentives (including the use of HOV lanes on state and Interstate highways) for the purchase and use of hybrid and other fuel efficient vehicles which have been proven to minimize air emissions and decrease consumption of fossil fuels. (Sec. 1122) Modifies the definition of \"transportation enhancement activity\" to include inventory of outdoor advertising (thus authorizing such activity as eligible for federal-aid highway funds). Defines \"advanced truck stop electrification system\" as a system that delivers heat, air conditioning, electricity, or communications to a heavy duty vehicle (thus authorizing such activity as eligible for federal-aid highway funds).
