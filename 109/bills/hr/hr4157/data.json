    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "2006-07-27", 
    "text": "Health Information Technology Promotion Act of 2006 - Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect the scope, substance, or applicability of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA, or HIPPA) and any related regulation regarding the privacy of individually identifiable health information, particularly the non-preemption of more stringent state law. Title I: Coordination For, Planning For, And Interoperability of Health Information Technology - (Sec. 101) Amends the Public Health Service Act to add a new title II part D (Health Information Technology). Establishes within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) an Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. Directs the National Coordinator to: (1) provide for a strategic plan for nationwide implementation of interoperable health information technology in both the public and private health care sectors; (2) serve as the principal advisor to the Secretary regarding such technology, and coordinate HHS policies and programs for promoting its use; (3) ensure that such policies and programs are coordinated with those of relevant federal agencies and departments; (4) identify funding sources to promote and support information technology planning and adoption in medically underserved communities; and (5) collaborate with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Health Services Resources Administration and other federal agencies to support technical assistance and resource development for such medically underserved communities, particularly those seeking to establish electronic health information networks across providers. Declares that Executive Order 13335 shall not have any force or effect after the enactment of this Act. Requires the National Coordinator to study and report to the Congress on the development and implementation of health information technology in medically underserved communities. (Sec. 102) Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to Congress on the work conducted by the American Health Information Community, as established by the Secretary. (Sec. 103) Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the National Coordinator to: (1) publish a strategic plan and schedule for assessment and endorsement of core interoperability guidelines for significant use cases; (2) endorse a subset of core interoperability guidelines for such cases; and (3) continue endorsing such subsets annually, consistent with the schedule, with endorsement of all such guidelines completed by August 31, 2009. Makes compliance with such guidelines voluntary. Directs the National Coordinator to conduct one or more surveys designed to measure the capability of entities to exchange electronic health information by appropriate significant use case. Directs the President to take measures to ensure that federal activities involving the broad collection and submission of health information are consistent with an endorsed core interoperability guideline within three years after the date of such endorsement. Directs the President to take measures to allow timely access to useful categories of non-identifiable health information in records maintained by the federal government or by federal contractors to advance health care quality and health research where such information is in a form that can be used in such research. Requires the National Coordinator to: (1) review annually for five years the operation of health information collection by and submission to the federal government and the purchases (and planned purchases) of health information technology by the federal government; and (2) recommend to the President and the Congress methods to streamline federal health information collection and submission systems, improve collection and submission efficiency and the ability to assess health care quality, and reduce health care costs. (Sec. 104) Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to integrated health care systems for projects to better coordinate the provision of health care through the adoption of new health information technology, or the significant improvement of existing health information technology, in order to improve provision of health care to uninsured, underinsured, and medically underserved individuals through health-related information. Authorizes appropriations for FY2007-FY2008. (Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary to establish a demonstration program of grants to small physician practices located in rural areas or medically underserved urban areas for the purchase and support of health information technology. Authorizes appropriations for FY2007-FY2008. Title II: Transaction Standards, Codes, and Information - (Sec. 201) Amends title XI of the Social Security Act (SSA) to direct the Secretary to provide for an expedited upgrade program for adoption of additions and modifications to electronic transaction standards.
