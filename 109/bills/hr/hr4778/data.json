    "text": "Hawaiian Waters Chemical Munitions Safety Act of 2006 - Directs the Secretary of the Army to: (1) conduct a survey of all Hawaiian underwater sites where chemical munitions are known to have been disposed of by the Armed Forces between 1941 and 1972; and (2) identify on Hawaiian coastal nautical charts and other navigational materials navigational hazards to private activities and commercial shipping or fishing operations as identified in the survey. Requires the Secretary to implement appropriate monitoring mechanisms to recognize and track the potential release of hazardous chemical agents into the marine environment from such disposal sites. Directs the Secretary to establish a program to conduct research and provide research grants to study the long-term effects of seawater exposure on chemical munitions, including the potential public health risks associated with, and the environmental impact of, ocean disposal of chemical munitions. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the feasibility and cost of implementing multiple remediation measures at the disposal sites covered by the survey, including an analysis of the public health and environmental safety risks of such sites."
