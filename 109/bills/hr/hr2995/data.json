Establishes within the U.S. Treasury the Weather Modification Research and Development Fund. Directs the Board, unless the use of the money is restricted or subject to any limitations provided by law, to use amounts in the Fund to: (1) pay its expenses in the administration of this Act; and (2) provide for R&D with respect to weather modifications by grants to, or contracts or cooperative arrangements with, public or private agencies."
