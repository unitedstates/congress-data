    "text": "Safe Online Drug Act of 2005 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit selling prescriptions through Internet sites that fail to meet all standards and regulations or owning or operating an illegal Internet pharmacy. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, to certify Internet pharmacies that meet certain conditions, including: (1) verifying compliance with applicable laws; (2) verifying controls to ensure that prescriptions are only dispensed with a valid prescription; (3) agreeing to allow inspections by the Secretary; (4) offering a meaningful and accessible opportunity for consumers to consult with licensed pharmacists; (5) using controls to ensure authenticity and security of prescription orders; and (6) having an effective, accessible system to communicate with consumers. Requires the Secretary to provide a seal to certified pharmacies. Allows the Secretary to deem Internet pharmacies as meeting all requirements if they are certified by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy's Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites program. Prohibits pharmacies from advertising that a prescription drug can be obtained without a prescription. Prohibits interactive computer services from accepting advertisements from or providing links to any illegal Internet pharmacy. Sets forth provisions requiring regulations to require designated payment systems to establish policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify and prevent restricted transactions with illegal Internet pharmacies."
