    "text": "Clinical Research Act of 2005 - Requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to award clinical investigator advancement grants to eligible academic health centers to: (1) establish career development programs for new and mid-level clinician-investigators who are fully committed to academic clinical research careers; (2) support the translation of basic science to patient care by implementing and conducting all aspects of their clinical research mission; and (3) support activities leading to innovative ways to achieve such purposes in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Requires that health centers receive a proportionate share of the total grant money awarded based on the amount invested by the grantee in clinical research compared to the total clinical research investment of all grantees. Requires the Director to award clinical research infrastructure grants to eligible academic health centers to: (1) foster the use of information technology to facilitate the transformation of basic research findings on disease mechanisms into the development of new methodologies for diagnosis, therapy, and prevention; (2) address the obstacles impeding the expeditious application of new science, including a lack of up-to-date information technology systems and an underrepresentation of some populations in clinical research; and (3) share clinical research infrastructure across academic health centers to enable and facilitate cross-center clinical research collaborations. Allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make up to five grants to eligible academic health centers to form partnerships with health care providers for carrying out clinical human subject research to demonstrate how academic research centers may collaborate with the practicing health care community."
