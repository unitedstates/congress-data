    "date": "2006-07-26", 
    "text": "Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2007 - Title I: Department of Transportation - Department of Transportation Appropriations Act, 2007 - Authorizes appropriations for FY2007 for: (1) the Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of the Secretary; (2) the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), with a prohibition on the use of grants-in-aid for airport funds for the replacement of baggage conveyor systems, reconfiguration of terminal baggage areas, or other airport improvements that are necessary to install bulk explosive detection systems; (3) the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA); (4) the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration; (5) the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; (6) the Federal Railroad Administration, including quarterly grants and efficiency incentive grants to the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak); (7) the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), including capital investment grants for specified transportation projects; (8) the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation; (9) the Maritime Administration; (10) the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration; (11) the Research and Innovative Technology Administration; (12) the Office of Inspector General; and (13) the Surface Transportation Board. Sets forth certain rescissions of contract authorizations, liquidations of contract authorizations, limitations on obligations, and transfers of funds. (Sec. 102) Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary in this title) to transfer unexpended balances available for the bonding assistance program from \"Office of the Secretary, Salaries and expenses\" to \"Minority Outreach.\" (Sec. 110) Prohibits the use of funds to compensate in excess of 395 technical staff-years under the federally funded research and development center contract between the FAA and the Center for Advanced Aviation Systems Development during FY2007. (Sec. 113) Extends the authority of the Secretary to issue aviation ( war and terrorism risk) insurance through December 31, 2007. (Sec. 114) Requires the Secretary to modify the FAA rule prohibiting piloting commercial aircraft by pilots age 60 and over to: (1) provide that a pilot who attains age 60 may serve as a pilot until age 65 on the condition that such pilot serves only as a pilot in a multi-crew aircraft operation and when there is not another pilot age 60 in the crew; and (2) eliminate the prohibition against piloting by pilots age 60 and over. Prohibits such modification from providing the basis for a claim of seniority made under any labor bargaining agreement in effect between the pilots and an air carrier by any pilot seeking re-employment by an air carrier following the pilot's previous termination or cessation of employment. Requires the Comptroller General to report to Congress on the effect, if any, on aviation safety caused by such modification. (Sec. 123) Makes certain unobligated discretionary bridge funds for the Joachim Avenue Bridge Replacement, Missouri, available for the New Herculaneum Bridge, Herculaneum, Missouri. (Sec. 125) Requires certain funds for the New Haven River Bore project, New Haven, Missouri, for FY2006, to be reprogrammed and made available to the Missouri Department of Transportation for roadway improvements at intersection Route 100 and Highway 19. (Sec. 126) Directs the Secretary, 15 days prior to waiving Buy America requirements for federal-aid highway projects, to give public notice and an opportunity to comment on such waiver. Requires the Secretary to report to the Appropriations Committees on waivers granted under the Buy America requirements. (Sec. 130) Subjects funds appropriated or limited in this Act to certain safety examination requirements for cross-border trucking between the United States and Mexico under the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002. Reaffirms the requirement that the Secretary report annually on the safety and security of transportation into the United States by Mexico-domiciled motor carriers. (Sec. 131) Amends the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy For Users (SAFETEA-LU) to delay for an additional 12 months the repeal of the Single State Registration System (SSRS) for motor vehicles and its eventual replacement with the new Unified Carrier Registration System (UCR). Directs the General Accountability Office (GAO) to report quarterly to Congress on progress made in establishing the UCR. (Sec. 132) Amends federal transportation law to subject a private motor carrier for the transportation of passengers or property to certain financial responsibility requirements.
