Amends the the Immigration and Nationality Act to reduce the total per country level of legal immigration determined for each country by one-half of the number of illegal aliens from that country who were residing in the United States as of August 31 of the preceding fiscal year. (Provides that no reduction for any single foreign state or dependent area may exceed one-half of the total per country level of legal immigration that otherwise would apply for any fiscal year.) Sets forth the following order of reductions: (1) diversity lottery winners; (2) brothers and sisters of citizens; (3) married sons and married daughters of citizens; (4) unmarried sons and unmarried daughters of permanent resident aliens; (5) unmarried sons and daughters of citizens; (6) skilled workers, professionals, and other specified workers; (7) special immigrants; (8) members of the professions holding advanced degrees or aliens of exceptional ability; (9) priority workers; (10) employment creation aliens; (11) veteran or active duty special immigrants; (12) spouses and children of permanent resident aliens; and (13) aliens not subject to quotas."
