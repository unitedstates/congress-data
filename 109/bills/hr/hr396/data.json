Directs the Secretary of State, through the Assistant Secretary for Oceans, Environment and Science, to report on: (1) the extent to which U.S. agencies that collect or receive all-hazard event data share such data with other U.S. agencies; (2) communications links between the United States and relevant foreign agencies; and (3) the feasibility of the Department of State directly contacting foreign media with all-hazard event information. Authorizes the President, through the Secretary, to provide assistance for programs that enhance the public warning capability of foreign countries.
