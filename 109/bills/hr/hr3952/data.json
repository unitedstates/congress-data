    "text": "Emergency Health Care Relief Act of 2005 - Requires a state to provide medical assistance to eligible Hurricane Katrina survivors under a state Medicaid plan. Increases the federal medical assistance percentage for providing medical assistance under a state Medicaid plan to any individual residing in certain affected areas of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Amends title XI of the Social Security Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to waive certain requirements in any geographical area in which there are a significant number of evacuees from an emergency area. Establishes the Disaster Relief Fund for payments to: (1) Medicaid providers to offset costs incurred by such providers as a result of Hurricane Katrina; and (2) state insurance commissioners for making payments to health insurance issuers for health insurance premiums for eligible individuals or qualified employers. Allows the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, or Alabama to enter into and participate in an agreement with the Secretary of Labor to make payments of temporary extended unemployment compensation to individuals who are not otherwise entitled to such compensation. Authorizes modifications to procurement procedures as necessary for the support of Hurricane Katrina rescue and relief operations. Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to expand the definition of private nonprofit facility to include for-profit hospitals."
