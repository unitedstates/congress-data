Requires the Secretary to conduct the project at two VHA medical centers within the same service area, selected from among medical centers located in those areas that the Secretary determines have relatively low rates of recovery or collection of indebtedness from third-party payors. Sets forth provisions regarding the selection and functions of the contractor, including requiring the contractor to establish a plan to standardize and coordinate all activities related to billing for health care furnished to veterans for non-service-connected disabilities, and a database containing third-party payor information for veterans receiving health care. Directs the Secretary to: (1) ensure that a VHA employee is designated to be the full-time project manager for the project and that such employee's duty station is at one of the medical centers at which the project is conducted; and (2) administer the project so that during the period of the conduct of the project (two years) there is no reduction in full-time equivalent employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs at the medical centers at which the project is conducted that is attributable to the conduct of the project."
