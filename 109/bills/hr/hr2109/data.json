    "text": "Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit any person from importing, transporting, or exporting municipal solid waste for final disposal or for incineration in violation of the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada Concerning the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste or any regulation implementing such agreement. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to: (1) perform the functions of the Designated Authority of the United States with respect to such importation and exportation under the agreement; and (2) implement and enforce the notice and consent provisions of the agreement as well as its other provisions. Sets forth factors to consider in determining whether to consent to the importation of municipal solid waste. Requires that the views of States be given substantial weight. Authorizes the Administrator to issue orders assessing civil penalties, requiring compliance, or both, or to commence civil actions in U.S. district court to address violations of this Act. Limits civil penalties assessed pursuant to an administrative order to $25,000 per day of noncompliance. Authorizes persons subject to administrative orders to request a public hearing. Authorizes States to enact laws imposing limitations (including prohibitions) on the receipt and disposal of foreign municipal solid waste. States that no such action shall be considered to impose an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce."
