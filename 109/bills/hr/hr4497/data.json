    "text": "Bringing Overstay Numbers Down Act of 2005 or the BOND Act of 2005 - Sets forth terms and conditions for immigration delivery bonds (a written suretyship for the surrender of an individual against whom the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has issued an order to show cause or a notice to appear, the performance of which is guaranteed by an acceptable surety on federal bonds). Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) with respect to the release of an alien detained pending a removal decision to: (1) permit corporate surety employees to visit the alien; (2) permit release of the alien on a delivery bond of at least $10,000; (3) permit release of such alien on his or her own recognizance only if an immigration judge expressly states in a signed release order that the alien is not a flight risk and is not a threat to the United States; and (4) eliminate parole release authority. Increases the amounts of recovered breached cash and surety bonds to be deposited into the Breached Bond/Detention Fund from amounts in excess of $8 million to amounts in excess of $80 million. States that: (1) DHS shall take into custody any alien subject to a final order of removal, and cancel any bond previously posted for the alien, if the alien is produced within the prescribed time limit by the bond obligor whether or not DHS accepts custody of the alien; and (2) the bond obligor shall be deemed to have performed all bond conditions and shall be released from liability if the alien is produced within such time limit. ."
