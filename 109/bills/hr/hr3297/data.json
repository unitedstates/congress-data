    "text": "State High Risk Pool Funding Extension Act of 2005 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize funds for states to create high risk health insurance pools and to operate existing pools. Amends the formula for appropriating funds to states to operate such pools to give one-half of the funds to eligible states equally and apportion the other half based on the number of uninsured individuals in each state and the number of enrollees in the state's qualified high risk pool. (Currently, all funds are allotted based solely on the number of uninsured individuals in the state.) Authorizes appropriations for the program through FY 2009. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to contract with the Institute of Medicine for a study on the development of a standard model for the certification of individuals as being uninsurable and thereby eligible for health benefits coverage through state high risk pools. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the tax credit for payment of qualified health insurance."
