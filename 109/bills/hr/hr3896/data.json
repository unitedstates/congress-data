Authorizes similar fund use in directly affected nonentitlement areas, and provides that such amounts shall not be considered for statewide limitation purposes. Defines: (1) \"directly affected community\" as a unit of general local government or area that is located in an area for which the President has declared a major disaster as a result of Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita; and (2) \"indirectly affected community\" as a unit of general local government or area that is a metropolitan city, urban county, or Indian tribe that is not a directly affected community and is determined by the Secretary to have been significantly affected economically by the occurrence of Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita (including from the presence of Katrina- or Rita-evacuated persons)."
