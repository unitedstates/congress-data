    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "2005-10-07", 
    "text": "Gasoline for America's Security Act of 2005 - Sets forth a statutory framework in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to: (1) increase refinery capacity for gasoline, heating oil, diesel fuel, and jet fuel; (2) reduce environmental and other regulations affecting refineries under the Clean Air Act; and (3) coordinate permitting requirements and other regulations affecting refineries at the federal, state, and local levels. Title I: Increasing Refinery Capacity - (Sec. 101) Prescribes guidelines for federal-state regulatory coordination between a state Governor, the Secretary of Energy (Secretary), and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA Administrator), including financial, technical and legal assistance, in order to facilitate refinery siting, construction, expansion, or operation. Instructs the President to designate sites on federal lands for siting of a refinery, including at least three military installations closed or approved for closure. Requires real property at such military installations, even those found suitable for refinery siting, to be managed and disposed of in the manner provided by the applicable base closure law. (Sec. 102) Designates the Department of Energy (DOE) as the lead agency for coordinating all federal refinery authorizations and related environmental reviews. Requires federal and state agencies or officials to cooperate with the Secretary and comply with deadlines. Instructs the Secretary to establish a federal refinery authorization schedule. (Sec. 103) Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to repeal refinery revitalization guidelines governing federal-state regulatory coordination and assistance. (Sec. 104) Authorizes the Secretary to contract with certain non-federal entities to construct new refineries in the United States or refurbish and return to commercial operation existing but nonoperating refineries. Establishes in the Treasury the Standby Refinery Support Account to cover specified costs of new or refurbished refinery operations. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 105) Empowers the President to authorize the design, construction, and site selection for a refinery for the exclusive purpose of manufacturing petroleum products for consumption by the Armed Forces, if the President determines that there is not sufficient refining capacity in the United States. Prescribes funding guidelines that: (1) prohibit funds appropriated for the Department of Defense or for Department of Energy national security programs from being used to enter into contracts for such refinery design, construction, or operation; and (2) permit funds appropriated for the Department of Defense to be used to purchase petroleum products manufactured at a refinery constructed under this Act by the Armed Forces. (Sec. 106) Amends Clean Air Act requirements for air pollution prevention to authorize the President, during an extreme and unusual fuel or fuel additive supply emergency resulting from a natural disaster, to waive temporarily: (1) any control or prohibition respecting the use of a fuel or fuel additive; and (2) any related or equivalent control or prohibition respecting the use of a federally required fuel or fuel additive. Declares that this Act shall not be construed to authorize the waiver of, or to affect in any way, any federal or state law or regulation pertaining to ethanol or methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE). (Sec. 107) Instructs the Administrator, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, to publish a Federal Fuels List composed of specified gasoline and diesel fuel blends. Prohibits such blends from controlling fuel sulfur or toxic levels beyond those required by Administrator. (Sec.108) Sets forth extended attainment dates for certain downwind ozone nonattainment areas. (Sec. 109) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to issue and begin implementing regulations for paying to a qualified small refinery a rebate for any sale to it of crude oil obtained by the United States as royalty-in-kind. Subjects such rebate requirement to the availability of funds provided in advance in appropriations Acts.
