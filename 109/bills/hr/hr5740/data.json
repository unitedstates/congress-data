Sets forth a formula to determine the maximum allowable premium that certain qualified disabled beneficiaries and individuals receiving extended coverage provided pursuant to this Act may be charged based on the average monthly actuarial cost of such continuation coverage. Applies such provisions to continuation coverage provided pursuant to the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP)."
