    "text": "International Security Enhancement Act of 2005 - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President to provide assistance for stabilization and reconstruction operations in a country or region that is in, or is in transition from, or is likely to enter into, conflict or civil strife. Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to direct the Secretary of State to establish within the Department of State an Office of the Coordinator for Stabilization and Reconstruction, which shall: (1) be headed by the Coordinator for Stabilization and Reconstruction; and (2) have primary responsibility for planning and administering stabilization and reconstruction operations in a country or region that is in, or is in transition from, or is likely to enter into, conflict or civil strife. Establishes within the Foreign Service Institute an International Stabilization and Reconstruction Training Center. Directs the Coordinator to establish within the Office: (1) a Stabilization and Reconstruction Corps of up to 250 persons; and (2) a Stabilization and Reconstruction Reserve of volunteers. Authorizes presidential deployment of Corps and Reserve members. Establishes in the Treasury the Department of State Stabilization and Reconstruction Operations Support Fund. Authorizes the President to provide Fund amounts to the Office for a country of impending or immediate risk. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) funds appropriated to carry out the amendments made by this Act should be offset by reductions in redundant or duplicative functions and foreign assistance programs of the Department of State; and (2) increased staff levels required by the amendments made by this Act should be offset by the transfer of staff within the Department of State, and the elimination of resultant redundant Department of State functions."
