    "text": "Aquatic Invasive Species Research Act - Requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Smithsonian Institution, and the U.S. Geological Survey (administering agencies) to: (1) enter into a memorandum of understanding regarding the implementation and coordination of this Act; and (2) develop a marine and fresh-water research program to support efforts to assess introduction rates and patterns of invasive nonnative species into the aquatic ecosystem, and efforts to detect, prevent, and eradicate them. Requires the administering agencies to: (1) develop standardized protocols for conducting ecological and pathway surveys of such species; (2) conduct research to identify the relationship between the introduction and establishment of such species; and (3) analyze the data collected and develop a profile that determines whether a species planned for importation is likely to invade an aquatic ecosystem. . Requires the U.S. Geological Survey to develop a central, national pathway and ecological surveys database of information. Makes the Invasive Species Council responsible for disseminating such information and develop a national strategy for how it will be shared with Federal, State, and local entities. Requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop a grant program to fund research, development, demonstration and verification of environmentally sound, cost-effective technologies and methods to control and eradicate such species. Reauthorizes the ship pathway technology demonstration program. Requires the Coast Guard and the EPA to develop a research program to support implementation of ship pathway standards to prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by ships. Requires the National Science Foundation to establish a grant program for researchers at institutions of higher education and museums to carry our research programs in systematics and taxonomy."
