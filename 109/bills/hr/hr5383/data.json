Imposes a freeze on interest rate terms and fees on canceled cards. Prohibits: (1) penalties for on-time payments; and (2) over-the-limit fees for creditor-approved transactions. Requires disclosure of: (1) the repayment information applicable to the outstanding balance; and (2) late payment deadlines, postmark dates, and any increase in interest rates for late payments. Increases the civil penalty against any creditor who fails to comply with specified requirements in the case of an individual action relating to an open end credit plan that is not secured by real property or a dwelling. Prohibits issuance of: (1) a credit card under an open end credit plan on behalf of a consumer who has not attained the age of 21, unless the consumer has submitted a written application meeting specified requirements; or (2) certain affinity cards to students unless certain requirements have been met."
