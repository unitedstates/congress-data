    "text": "Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) ensure that Department of Homeland Security personnel along the U.S.-Mexico border have the security clearances required to access information to adequately screen entering immigrants; (2) develop the interagency agreements and information technology infrastructure necessary for such screening; (3) explore information sharing programs with countries of interest; and (4) increase by the amount necessary the number of detention beds needed to detain all immigrants apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Expresses the sense of Congress that the Office of Detention and Removal Operations should be placed under the operational control of the Commissioner of CBP (currently, under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement). Requires the Secretary to: (1) contract with an independent entity to study the necessary level and allocation of personnel at U.S. ports of entry and border patrol sectors; (2) provide ongoing training for all border security personnel; and (3) submit a report on detention and removal operations and a unified, comprehensive border security strategy to appropriate congressional committees. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) prosecutors and immigration judges are critical for the prompt and proper enforcement of immigration laws and are an important part of a comprehensive strategy; and (2) there is an insufficient number of prosecutors and immigration judges for immigration enforcement. Authorizes appropriations for staff increases."
