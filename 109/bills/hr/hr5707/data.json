Requires the Secretary to make such information available to the public, including on a site on the Internet. Directs the Secretary to inspect each cruise ship that enters a U.S. port to determine whether such ship has adequate equipment and trained personnel to investigate such crimes. Requires a cruise line that sells a ticket for carriage of an individual on a cruise ship that will call at a U.S. port to: (1) refer such individual to the Internet site before selling the ticket; and (2) provide the individual with the name of each country the cruise ship will visit, as well as the locations of each U.S. embassy and consulate in such country. Sets forth civil penalties for persons that violate the requirements of this Act."
