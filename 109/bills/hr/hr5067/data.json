Directs the Secretary to establish a university-based Center for Excellence for Border Security. Requires mandatory detention of an alien apprehended illegally seeking to enter the United States at a U.S. port of entry or land or maritime border as of October 1, 2006, unless such alien is: (1) paroled into the United States for humanitarian or public benefit reasons; or (2) is permitted to withdraw an application for admission and immediately departs from the United States.

Directs the Secretary to take specified actions to ensure coordination of DHS border security efforts. Establishes in DHS an Office of Air and Marine Operations whose primary mission shall be to prevent the entry of terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband into the United States, and whose secondary mission shall be to assist other agencies with such protective functions.
