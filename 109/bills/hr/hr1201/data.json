States that such transactions constitute either an unfair method of competition, or an unfair and deceptive act or practice in commerce.Authorizes the Commission to develop rules and regulations governing such transactions. Amends Federal copyright law to exempt from its prohibitions against circumvention of copyright protection systems any persons acting solely in furtherance of scientific research into technological measures. Declares it is not a violation of copyright law, but fair use, to: (1) circumvent a technological measure in order to obtain access to a work for purposes of making noninfringing use of the work; or (2) manufacture or distribute a hardware or software product capable of substantial noninfringing uses except in instances of direct infringement."
