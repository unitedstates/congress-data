    "text": "Accurate Great Lakes Flood Estimate Act of 2006 - Amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to set a deadline by which the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency shall request the Corps of Engineers to complete an updated analysis of flood levels for areas surrounding the Great Lakes and their interconnecting channels in order to assist the Director in the development of maps identifying 100- and 500-year flood inundation areas. Prohibits the Director from increasing the base flood elevation in any community in areas surrounding the Great Lakes and their interconnecting channels until the Corps of Engineers completes the first updated flood level analysis. Identifies such channels as the St. Mary's River, St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, the Detroit River, the Niagara River, and the St. Lawrence River."
