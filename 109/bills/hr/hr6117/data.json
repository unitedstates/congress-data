    "text": "Contact Lens Consumer Health Protection Act - Amends the Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act to require the seller to provide the prescriber with a toll-free telephone number and email address for questions relating to a contact lens prescription verification request. Revises the verification event in which a prescription is verified if the prescriber fails to communicate with the seller within eight business hours, or a similar time as defined by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), after receiving required patient and prescription information from the seller. States that if a prescriber communicates a question or concern to a seller through such toll-free telephone service or dedicated email address before such eight-hour period has ended, the seller must obtain affirmative confirmation of the accuracy of the prescription from the prescriber before the prescription is considered verified. Authorizes a prescriber to make a written request to a seller that all contact lens prescription verification requests be communicated by a preferred method of communication, including telephone, facsimile, or email. Authorizes fines for violations of this Act in amount up to $100,000 per violation. Directs the FTC to examine and report to Congress on the potential and actual adverse effects on consumers of seller violations of the requirements of this Act."
