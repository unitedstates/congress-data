Authorizes the Secretary to designate insect-emergency areas. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to make grants to at-risk communities in the Rocky Mountain region to assist such communities to prepare or revise a community wildfire protection plan. Requires the Secretary to establish at least one collection point for the placement of vegetative material removed from federal or other lands as part of hazardous fuel reduction projects. Authorizes the Secretary to award stewardship contracts to, or enter in agreements with, owners of lands contiguous to federal lands managed by the Secretary under which the landowners may carry out a fuel-reduction project or other activities on the contiguous federal lands in order to reduce the extent to which the federal lands or other lands could be affected by wildfires."
