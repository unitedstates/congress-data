Defines as an eligible obligation any security designated by the Secretary of the Treasury as acceptable in lieu of a surety bond. Authorizes the use of an eligible obligation instead of a surety bond if its market value, as determined by the Secretary, is equal to or greater than the amount of the required surety bond."
