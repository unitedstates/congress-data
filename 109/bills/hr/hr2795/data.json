Gives an inventor a right to apply for and obtain a patent, subject to conditions and regulations. (Current law allows inventors to obtain a patent.) Requires the Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to: (1) impose a duty of candor and good faith on individuals associated with the filing and prosecution of an application and on individuals who are parties adverse to a patent or application for patent in contested cases before USPTO; and (2) establish a special office to investigation violations of such duty. Revises provisions regarding treble damages for willful infringement of a patent. Allows the Director to limit the ability of patent applicants to get the benefit of the filing date of a prior-filed application. Expands the publication of patent applications. Revises provisions regarding the infringement defense based on prior use of the subject matter of a patent before the effective filing dates. Sets forth procedures and requirements for opposing a patent grant. Allows third parties to submit relevant information for inclusion in the record of a patent application."
