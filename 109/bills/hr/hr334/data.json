Amends the Act to so designate Angola for an initial one-year period. Sets forth TPS eligibility requirements for Angolan nationals, including: (1) continuous physical presence in the United States since the date of enactment of this Act; (2) admissibility as an immigrant (with certain exceptions) and eligibility for TPS; and (3) registration for TPS in a manner established by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Requires the Secretary to give prior consent to such aliens for brief, temporary trips abroad in emergency and extenuating circumstances."
