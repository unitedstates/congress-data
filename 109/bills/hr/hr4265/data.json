Directs the Secretary of Education to establish a pilot program to provide grants to encourage eligible institutions of higher education to establish and operate pregnant and parenting student services offices for pregnant students, parenting students, prospective parenting students anticipating a birth or adoption, and students who are placing or have placed a child for adoption."
