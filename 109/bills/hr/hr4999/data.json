    "text": "Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006 - Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) establish criteria for designating chemical sources, using specified risk factors, and evaluating the types of facilities (other than Department of Defense or Department of Energy facilities) in consideration; and (2) designate chemical sources already in existence. Directs the Secretary to promulgate rules establishing a risk-based tier system of chemical sources, based on such criteria, which enables a chemical source to develop appropriate site-specific measures to meet the security performance standards established for the applicable tier. Requires such rules to provide guidance to the chemical source owner or operator on steps that would enable the source to move to a lower risk tier. Directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations that require chemical source owners or operators to make vulnerability assessments, site security plans, and emergency response plans. Requires chemical sources regulated under the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA-regulated facilities) to comply with this Act. Requires the Secretary to establish an office under the Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection that shall be responsible for implementing and enforcing this Act. Directs the Secretary to establish in each Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Region an Infrastructure Protection Regional Security Office. Establishes Area Security Committees for geographic areas designated by the Secretary, which shall prepare Area Security Plans for the Secretary's approval. Directs the Secretary to conduct drills and exercises periodically in each area for which an Area Security Plan is required and under the site security plan and emergency response plans of relevant chemical sources. Authorizes the Secretary to order mandatory security measures for a chemical source if the Secretary determines that additional measures are necessary to respond to a threat assessment or to a specific threat against the chemical sector. Prescribes administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for failure to comply with an order or directive issued by the Secretary under this Act or with a site security plan."
