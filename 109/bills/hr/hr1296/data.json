    "text": "Intermodal Equipment Safety and Responsibility Act of 2005 - Subjects an equipment controller to liability for the systematic inspection, maintenance, and repair of equipment interchanged or intended for interchange. Requires an equipment controller: (1) prior to offering a motor carrier agent the equipment for interchange, to inspect the equipment and perform maintenance and repairs to the equipment to ensure that it complies with all applicable Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations; and (2) to promptly reimburse the motor carrier for actual expenses incurred and time spent by the motor carrier for any repair required to interchanged equipment to comply with the Regulations while in a motor carrier's possession. Makes an equipment controller liable for all violations of the Regulations attributable to the controller's equipment. Directs the controller to pay any applicable fines, penalties, and damages resulting from such violations, except for violations attributable to the controller's equipment that are proximately caused by the motor carrier's negligence or willful misconduct. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to conduct inspections. Prohibits an equipment controller from: (1) retaliating against a motor carrier who requests maintenance or repair of equipment intended for interchange to comply with the Regulations; and (2) delegating its responsibility to systematically maintain and repair equipment intended for interchange to a motor carrier in an equipment interchange agreement."
