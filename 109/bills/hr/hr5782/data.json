    "text": "Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006 - (Sec. 2) Amends federal transportation law to add a new requirement to the one-call notification system requirements that prohibits a person engaging in demolition, excavation, tunneling, or construction in the vicinity of a natural gas or hazardous liquid pipeline from: (1) engaging in such activity without first using the state's one-call notification system to establish the location of the underground pipeline; (2) engaging in such activity in disregard of location information or markings established by a pipeline operator; and (3) failing to report promptly pipeline damage to a pipeline operator, or in the case of damage that results in the escape of flammable, toxic, or corrosive gas or liquid, calling 911. Subjects violators to a civil penalty of up to $1 million. Subjects to certain civil penalties any pipeline operator who fails to respond to a location request in order to prevent damage to a pipeline or fails to take reasonable steps to ensure accurate marking of the location of the pipeline in order to prevent damage to such pipeline. Prohibits federal imposition of penalties for violations of such requirements that occur in a state that has the authority to impose state penalties against persons who violate state damage prevention laws, unless the state's enforcement is inadequate to protect safety. Requires state damage prevention programs to subject persons who violate program requirements to certain civil penalties and other enforcement actions. Makes grants to states to improve their damage prevention programs if such states: (1) have an annual pipeline safety program certification or a pipeline safety agreement; and (2) have a qualified damage prevention program or demonstrate that they have made substantial progress toward establishing such a program. Sets forth required damage prevention program elements. Increases the federal share for state pipeline safety grants from 50% to 80%. Makes technology development grants to eligible organizations to prevent pipeline damage caused by demolition, excavation, tunneling, or construction activities.

Requires that the minimum standards require operators of natural gas distribution systems to install excess flow valves on, and report annually on the number of such valves installed on, single family residential service lines that are connected to a natural gas distribution system. Requires each operator of a distribution pipeline that the Secretary determines is subject to the prescribed minimum standards to develop and implement an integrity management program in accordance with those standards. (Sec. 10) Authorizes the Secretary to waive federal pipeline safety requirements with respect to a pipeline operator for a period of not more than 60 days without prior notice and opportunity for public comment if: (1) it is in the public interest; and (2) such waiver is not inconsistent with pipeline safety and is necessary to address an emergency involving pipeline transportation (including an emergency caused by a natural or manmade disaster). (Sec. 11) Authorizes the Secretary to assist with heads of federal and state agencies, and public and private agencies and persons, to restore pipeline operations that have been or are anticipated to become disrupted by manmade or natural disasters. (Sec. 12) Directs the Secretary, not later than June 1, 2008, to issue regulations to require operators of natural gas or hazardous liquid pipelines to develop, implement, and submit for approval to the Secretary (or in the case of intrastate pipeline operators, to the appropriate state authority) a human factors management plan to reduce risks associated with human factors, including fatigue, in pipeline control centers. (Sec. 13) Directs the Secretary, not later than December 31, 2007, to issue regulations to authorize the Secretary after determining that a pipeline has a condition that poses a pipeline integrity risk to public safety, property, or the environment to issue a safety order to the pipeline operator to take corrective action, including physical inspection, testing, repair, or other appropriate action, to remedy the condition. (Sec. 14) Authorizes the Secretary to conduct certain proceedings against natural gas or hazardous liquid pipeline operators that have not adequately implemented a risk analysis or integrity management program. (Sec. 15) Directs the Secretary, not later than December 31, 2007, to review incident reporting requirements for natural gas pipeline operators and modify reporting criteria as appropriate to ensure that incident data gathered accurately reflects incident trends over time, taking into consideration the recommendations from the Comptroller General in GAO report 06-946. (Sec. 16) Requires the Secretary to establish procedures to require certification (signature) of annual and semiannual pipeline integrity management program performance reports by senior executive officers of companies operating pipelines. (Sec. 17) Authorizes the Secretary to require a person requesting a pipeline design safety review of a proposal to construct, expand, or operate a liquefied natural gas pipeline to pay associated staff costs related to such review. Directs the Secretary to deposit funds paid into the Treasury. Authorizes appropriations from such funds for natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline related activities. (Sec. 18) Authorizes appropriations for FY2007-FY2010 to the Department of Transportation (DOT) for natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline safety, including pipeline integrity, safety, and reliability research and development activities. Earmarks amounts from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for FY2007-FY2010 for such activities. Requires the Secretary to ensure, under the program for making grants to state, county, and local governments in high consequence areas that the Secretary is authorized to establish for emergency response management, training, and technical assistance, to the extent that such grants are used to train emergency responders, that such responders are trained in the ability to protect nearby persons, property, and the environment from the effects of accidents or incidents involving gas or hazardous liquid pipelines, in accordance with existing regulations. Authorizes appropriations for FY2007-FY2010 for: (1) grants to improve state one-call notification programs; and (2) administrative expenses.
