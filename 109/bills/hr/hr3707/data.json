Declares that anyone who willfully violates any such order or regulation shall be fined an amount up to three times the amount of the gain from such violation. Authorizes the President, or any delegatee, to seek a temporary or permanent injunction to prevent or halt violations of orders or regulations issued under this Act. Terminates the authority under this Act upon a finding by the President that the domestic supply of petroleum products meets or exceeds the level of domestic supply as of August 27, 2005."
