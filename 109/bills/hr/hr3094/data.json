    "text": "Secure America's Vote Act of 2005 - Amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to direct the Election Assistance Commission to revise the mail voter registration form to emphasize more prominently the requirement that an individual be a U.S. citizen to register to vote in federal elections. Prohibits a state from: (1) rejecting an application for voter registration for federal office soley for the individual's failure to provide required information or error in providing such information, if with reasonable effort the state would be able to correct it; or (2) removing an individual from the official list of eligible voters for federal elections by reason of felony status or death unless the applicable database meets accuracy standards established by the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Requires a state to notify the public, within 45 days before any federal election, by posting on the chief state election official's public website, and through other appropriate methods, of: (1) all names removed from the computerized list since the later of the most recent election for federal office held in the state or the day of the most recent previous public notice; (2) the criteria, processes, and procedures used to determine which names were removed; and (3) information on the steps an individual may take to appeal such removal and reinstate himself or herself before the election. Establishes a uniform standard for the treatment of provisional ballots cast at an incorrect polling place. Provides for additional security requirements for voting systems used in federal elections. Requires states to make election laws available to the public. Establishes criminal penalties for voter suppression. Directs the Election Assistance Commission to establish best practice guidelines for the treatment of absentee ballots of uniformed services voters and overseas voters to ensure their timely delivery and return."
