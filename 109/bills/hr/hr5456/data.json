    "text": "Illegal Immigration Crisis Response Act of 2006 - Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) increase incentives to recruit full-time Border Patrol agents; and (2) establish a Border Patrol agent training program that provides one year's tuition for each year of full-time Border Patrol service. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) deploy newly developed technologies along the U.S. land and maritime borders; and (2) construct a fence along the southern border. Prohibits U.S. admission without presentation of appropriate documentation, such as a passport, visa, U.S. driver's license, alien registration card, or border crossing card. Declares English to be the official language of the United States. Authorizes persons injured by violations of this Act to obtain appropriate relief in civil actions. Declares, as a general rule of construction, that English language requirements and workplace policies, whether in the public or private sector, shall be presumptively consistent with U.S. laws. Directs the Secretary to establish in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) an Office of Alien Registration to manage the registration, adjustment, and citizenship process of aliens unlawfully in the United States. Provides that: (1) an alien who has been continuously present in the United States since the date of introduction of this Act may register with the Office (during the six months after establishment of such Office), and if determined to not have a criminal or terrorist background, be issued a temporary, and subsequently, permanent registration card (upon registration the alien shall become liable for federal and state taxes); (2) an unlawful alien who is not registered or has not satisfied certain requirements shall be subject to expedited removal and criminal penalties; (3) upon registration an alien shall receive 15-month temporary resident status, which shall be adjusted to permanent resident status upon timely application after one year's residence and demonstration of citizenship skills (makes such alien eligible for naturalization); and (4) an alien who fails to adjust to permanent resident status shall be removed from the United States. Requires an employer who hires an alien who is eligible for registration but not otherwise registered to register such alien with the Office. Provides a fine for employer registration violations. Requires temporary worker (H-2) visas to be tamper-resistant and counterfeit-proof and to contain a biometric component."
