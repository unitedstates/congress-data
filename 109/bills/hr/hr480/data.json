Provides for the recomputation of an annuity for any individual who performed any service creditable under CSRS (or under the Federal Employees Retirement System, to the extent of any portion of such annuity which is computed under CSRS) before such date and who was separated from the service on or after such date and before the enactment of this Act. Directs the Office of Personnel Management to inform individuals entitled to have an annuity recomputed under this Act."
