Describes the protocols that shall apply with respect to maintenance, repairs, and improvements of R.S. 2477 highways. Acknowledges and recognizes public rights-of-way over federal land (or any federal-land portion of a public right-of-way over both federal and non-federal land) for highways shown in certain official governmental maps and aerial photographs as having validly vested under R.S. 2477 and disclaims all right, title, and interest with respect thereto."
