Terminates the Secretary's authority to make such payments if the State of California or local education agencies do not continue to provide funding to the schools in those school districts at per student levels that are no less than the amount provided in fiscal year 2005. Sets forth limitations on the use and amount of such funds, including a maximum limit of $400,000 on payments in any fiscal year. Prohibits payments under this Act from coming from: (1) fees under the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965; (2) the recreational fee demonstration program; (3) the national park passport program; and (4) emergency appropriations for Yosemite flood recovery. Amends the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996 to allow certain facilities to be located outside the boundaries of Yosemite National Park. Rancho Corral de Tierra Golden Gate National Recreation Area Boundary Adjustment Act - Modifies the boundaries of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in California to include specified additional lands. Allows the Secretary of the Interior to acquire certain of those lands only from a willing seller."
