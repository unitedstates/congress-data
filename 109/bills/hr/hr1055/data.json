    "text": "Comprehensive Methamphetamine Response Act - Authorizes the Director of National Drug Control Policy to designate a State, or any portion of a State, as a high intensity methamphetamine abuse and trafficking area (HIMATA) and provide funding for such areas after: (1) receiving a Governor's petition for such designation; and (2) making a determination for the area on the basis of the methamphetamine epidemic severity index developed under this Act. Requires the Director to give priority consideration to areas that are already so designated if methamphetamine is a primary reason for that designation. Requires the Director to develop a methamphetamine epidemic severity index to be used in making HIMATA determinations based on specified factors, including per capita rates of methamphetamine possession or production, lab seizures, and addiction in an area. Authorizes the Director to provide funding to a State to implement a HIMATA after receipt of a comprehensive methamphetamine response plan (CMRP). Requires the Director to determine funding levels based on the population and the severity index of the area, with an exception. Requires the Director to require the State in which the HIMATA is located to develop a CMRP that: (1) describes the manner in which the State plans to use funding provided to address any existing inadequacies in enforcement, treatment, prevention, and precursor controls; and (2) in the case of a HIMATA that overlaps with a high intensity drug trafficking area, addresses how the two programs will coordinate."
