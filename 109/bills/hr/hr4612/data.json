Limits projects funded through these grants to construction and development on non-federal property within the boundaries of the Park, Instruct that, any project funded by such a grant, support the purposes of the park, be consistent with the Park's general management plan, and enhance public use and enjoyment of the park. Amends Title V of division J of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 to remove the Neil Armstrong Air & Space Museum, Wapakoneta, Ohio, from inclusion in the boundaries of the the National Aviation Heritage Area."
