Makes the same changes with respect to all policy cash, loan, paid-up, and extended values. Increases from $90,000 to $200,000 the maximum amount of veterans' mortgage life insurance coverage. Includes still-born children within dependent coverage under the Servicemembers Group Life Insurance program."
