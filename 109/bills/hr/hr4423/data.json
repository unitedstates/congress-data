Declares that the current stalemate in the border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea has the potential to lead to conflict and must be addressed. Prohibits assistance to the governments of Ethiopia or Eritrea (with exceptions for assistance for democracy, peacekeeping, child survival and health, education, and agriculture) until the Secretary of State certifies that Ethiopia or Eritrea is taking steps to comply with the Algiers Agreements. Prohibits nonessential U.S. assistance to Ethiopia if the government of Ethiopia obstructs U.S. technical assistance to Ethiopian opposition parties."
