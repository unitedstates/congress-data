Defines \"baseline budget surplus\" as the sum of the on- and off-budget surpluses contained in the most recent baseline budget projections by the Congressional Budget Office at the beginning of the annual budget cycle and no later than the month of March. Defines circumstances in which a portion of such surpluses is used in the case of legislation affecting revenues or direct spending or an appropriations bill."
