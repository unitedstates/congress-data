Requires a State reserve unit to: (1) withhold the net proceeds from the sale or refinancing of real property in the State against which a lien exists for overdue child support by the seller or refinancer, without regard to whether such lien has ever been extinguished; (2) hold a certain amount of such proceeds (anticipated future child support) in trust for the benefit of the child or children for whom the person has a support obligation; and (3) apply such amounts to satisfy such overdue child support, if all other available remedies are insufficient to do so."
