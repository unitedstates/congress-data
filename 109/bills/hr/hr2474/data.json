Defines \"qualified life-saving organ\" as a kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, intestine, bone marrow, or any part thereof. Limits the annual amount of such credit to $5,000 of the unreimbursed costs and lost wages incurred by an organ donor in connection with an organ transplant. Amends the Public Health Service Act to: (1) reduce federal living organ donation grants by any tax credit for organ donation received under this Act; and (2) provide that any such tax credit not be deemed valuable consideration for purposes of the ban against organ purchases."
