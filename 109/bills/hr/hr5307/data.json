Defines prompt payment as within 14 days from submission for claims submitted electronically, and within 30 days for claims submitted otherwise. Requires payment of interest, also, if a payment is not issued, mailed, or otherwise transmitted within the applicable number of calendar days. Prohibits a Medicare prescription drug card issued by a PDP sponsor or an MA-PD plan, and any related marketing materials, from displaying the name or brand of any pharmacy (co-branding). Prescribes criminal penalties for engaging in prohibited co-branding."
