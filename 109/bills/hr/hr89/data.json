Provides that an air carrier is not required to provide such air transportation to a passenger unless that passenger makes alternative arrangements with such air carrier within 60 days after the date on which the passenger's air transportation was suspended, interrupted, or discontinued (without regard to the originally scheduled travel date on the ticket)."
