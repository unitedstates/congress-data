    "text": "Borrower's Bill of Rights Act - Amends Federal law to create the position of Assistant Secretary for Financial Education in the Department of the Treasury. Amends the Financial Literacy and Education Improvement Act to direct such Secretary to establish a two-year financial literacy pilot program for middle and high school students. Amends the Truth in Lending Act to require that mandatory disclosures governing a consumer credit transaction be simple, easy to understand, and in a language understood by the consumer. Amends the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 to repeal the preemption of state mortgage usury laws. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Federal Credit Union Act to provide that the constitution or the laws of any state expressly limiting the rate or amount of interest, discount points, finance charges, or other charges shall apply to all depository institutions and credit unions, respectively, that are located in, have any branch in, or do business in such state with respect to customers which reside in or are located in such state. Amends the Truth in Lending Act to: (1) prohibit \"flipping\" practices and mandatory arbitration; (2) lower the interest rate threshold for high-cost mortgages; and (3) require creditors to receive certification that a consumer has successfully completed pre-loan counseling before extending the consumer credit under a high-cost mortgage. Sets limits governing rollovers or refinancing of payday loans with the same creditor. Amends the Federal bankruptcy code to: (1) include within the fourth order of priority of claims against the estate the rights or interests in debtor's equity securities that are held in a pension plan; (2) increase the employee earnings and benefits included within such fourth order of priority; and (3) exempt such employee pension benefits from subordination agreement constraints."
