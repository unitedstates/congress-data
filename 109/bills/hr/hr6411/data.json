Imposes a fine and/or prison term of up to five years for violations. Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to require private or public schools and educational agencies to adopt policies to ensure that all school or agency employees undergo a fingerprint-based check of the national crime information databases and, where possible, a fingerprint-based check of state criminal history databases."
