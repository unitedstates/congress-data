Transfers to the CHIO functions, personnel, assets, and liabilities of the National Coordinator for HIT. Requires the CHIO to award one-year grants to eligible HIT entities. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to carry out a demonstration program to determine methods by which contextual access criteria and analysis technologies for specific diseases and health criteria may be used to search patient electronic health records and aggregated health information without using personal identifying information of patients. Amends SSA title XI part A to establish a health care provider HIT loan program. Makes exceptions to certain health anti-kickback laws to encourage the dissemination of health information technology. Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on state laws and regulations relating to the security and confidentiality of individually identifiable health information to determine how any variation among the states, and between state and federal law, may adversely impact the electronic exchange of clinical health information among states, the federal government, and private entities."
