    "text": "Taxpayer Protection from Genetic Discrimination Act of 2006 - Prohibits a group health plan sponsored by a covered entity or a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage in connection with such a plan from: (1) adjusting premiums or contribution amounts for a group on the basis of genetic information concerning an individual in the group or a family member of the individual, including information about a request for or receipt of genetic services by such an individual or family member; and (2) requesting or requiring an individual or family member to undergo a genetic test. Defines \"covered entity\" as any agency or part of the federal government, any state or local entity that receives federal funds, or a federal contractor. Makes it an unlawful employment practice for any covered entity to discriminate against an individual or deprive such individual of employment opportunities because of genetic information. Prohibits the collection and disclosure of genetic information, with certain exceptions. Establishes a federal cause of action for any employee or family member of an employer of a covered entity who has been adversely effected by a violation of this Act."
