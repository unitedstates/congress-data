Requires the Secretary to study and report to Congress on the costs incurred by health care providers to provide such assessment. Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary to: (1) establish the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program to make five grants to eligible entities to establish mobile diabetic retinopathy screening programs; (2) give priority to entities with relevant experience who propose to serve rural, impoverished, unserved, minority, and remote populations; and (3) convene an advisory committee to evaluate the Program."
