    "text": "Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006 - Title I: Authorization - (Sec. 101) Authorizes appropriations for FY2006 for the Coast Guard (CG) for: (1) CG operation and maintenance, with a portion from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for certain purposes under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA purposes); (2) acquisition, construction, rebuilding, and improvement of aids to navigation, shore and offshore facilities, vessels, and aircraft, including related equipment (earmarking a Fund amount for OPA purposes, for the Integrated Deepwater Systems, and for sustainment of legacy vessels and aircraft); (3) CG research, development, test, and evaluation of technologies, materials, and human factors directly relating to improving CG performance in search and rescue, aids to navigation, marine safety, marine environmental protection, enforcement of laws and treaties, ice operations, oceanographic research, and defense readiness, with a portion from the Fund for OPA purposes; (4) retired pay, payments under the Retired Serviceman's Family Protection and Survivor Benefit Plans, and payments for medical care of retired personnel and their dependents; (5) alteration or removal of bridges over U.S. navigable waters constituting obstructions to navigation, and for personnel and administrative costs associated with the Bridge Alteration Program; (6) environmental compliance and restoration at CG facilities; and (7) the CG Reserve program, including personnel and training costs, equipment, and services. (Sec. 102) Authorizes a CG end-of-strength of 45,500 active duty military personnel for FY2006. Authorizes average military training student loads for FY2006 in specified numbers under the categories of Recruit/Special, Flight, Professional, and Officer. (Sec. 103) Authorizes additional appropriations to the CG for non-reimbursed expenditures related to Hurricane Katrina for: (1) operation and maintenance of the CG, including search and rescue, clearing channels, emergency response to oil and chemical spills, and higher fuel costs; and (2) the acquisition, construction, renovation, and improvement of aids to navigation, shore and offshore facilities, and vessels and aircraft, and equipment due to damage caused by such storm. (Sec. 104) Authorizes appropriations for FY2006 and FY2007 for the CG to continue deployment of a web-based risk management system to help reduce accidents and fatalities. Title II: Coast Guard - (Sec. 201) Amends federal naval law to extend the authority of the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating (Secretary) to control the anchorage and movement of vessels to ensure the safety or security of U.S. naval vessels in U.S. navigable waters to include all waters of the U.S. territorial sea as described in Presidential Proclamation No. 5928 of December 27, 1988. (Sec. 202) Authorizes the Commandant of the CG (in coordination with the Secretary of State) to provide in conjunction with regular CG operations technical assistance, including law enforcement and maritime safety and security training, to foreign navies, coast guards, and other maritime authorities. (Sec. 203) Revises CG officer promotion eligibility requirements to authorize the Secretary to waive certain ones to allow CG officers to have at least two opportunities for consideration for promotion to the next higher grade as officers below the promotion zone. (Sec. 204) Revises requirements for appointment of the director of the CG Band to authorize the Secretary to designate as director any individual determined to possess the necessary qualifications. (Currently the Secretary is required to designate the director from among qualified members of the CG.) Authorizes the current CG Band Director, upon enactment of this Act, to be promoted immediately to a commissioned grade, not to exceed captain, as determined by the Secretary to be most appropriate to the individual's qualifications and experience. (Sec. 205) Authorizes the Secretary to use one-step turnkey selection procedures when entering into contracts for the design and construction of CG facilities. Defines \"one-step turnkey selection procedures\" to mean procedures used for the selection of a contractor on the basis of price and other evaluation criteria to perform, in accordance with a firm fixed-price contract, both the design and construction of a facility using performance specifications supplied by the Secretary. (Sec. 206) Authorizes the Secretary, during an act of terrorism or transportation security incident, to order CG Ready Reserve members to active duty to no more than 60 days (currently, 30 days) in any four-month period and no more than 120 days (currently, 60 days) in any two-year period. (Sec. 207) Prohibits CG Reserve officers on an active-duty list from being counted as part of the authorized number of officers in the CG Reserve. (Currently, the authorized number of CG Reserve officers in an active status is 5,000.) Revises the distribution method for determining the number of CG Reserve officers on active status that are authorized to be serving in each grade. (Sec. 208) Authorizes the CG, in carrying out its duties as authorized by the Secretary, to utilize any motorized vehicle placed at its disposition by any member of the Auxiliary, by any corporation, partnership, or association, or by any state to tow federal government property. Makes CG appropriations available for payment of motorized vehicles when assigned to CG duty. (Sec. 209) Authorizes the CG Commandant to prescribe regulations for the award of fellowships in CG history to eligible U.S. citizens or nationals. Authorizes the CG Commandant to award up to two fellowships annually, (with fellowships not to exceed $25,000 in any year). (Sec. 210) Directs the Secretary to submit to Congress a plan for: (1) operation and maintenance after FY2006 of the CG polar icebreakers POLAR STAR, POLAR SEA, and HEALY that does not rely on the transfer of funds to the CG by any other federal agency; and (2) long-term recapitalization of such assets. Requires the Secretary to take necessary measures to ensure the CG maintains, at a minimum, its current vessel capacity for carrying out ice breaking in the Arctic and Antarctic, Great Lakes, and New England regions until it has implemented the long-term recapitalization of such vessels. Declares that nothing in this section shall preclude the Secretary from seeking reimbursement for vessel operation and maintenance costs from other federal agencies, including foreign countries, that benefit from the use of such vessels. (Sec. 211) Provides that the CG shall operate as a service in the Navy upon a declaration of war (current law), but only if Congress so directs in the declaration. Maintains the President's authority to direct the CG to operate as a service in the Navy. (Sec. 212) Prohibits the CG Commandant from moving CG personnel, property, or other assets to the West Campus of St. Elisabeth's Hospital until the Administrator of General Services submits a plan to Congress that includes providing for, among other things: (1) road access to the site from Interstate Route 295; and (2) the design of facilities for at least one federal agency other than the CG that would house no less than 2,000 employees. (Sec. 213) Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on opportunities for, and the feasibility of, co-locating CG assets and personnel at facilities of other armed forces throughout the United States. (Sec. 214) Directs the Secretary to examine the technical feasibility of using bio-diesel fuel in new and existing CG vehicles and vessels, with emphasis on the use of such fuel in ports with high-density vessel traffic, including ports for which vessel traffic systems have been established.
