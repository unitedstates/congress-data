Requires the Commissioner of Social Security, in such a case, to send a prompt written notice (\"no match\" letter): (1) informing the employer of the discrepancies; (2) requesting information that would assist the Commissioner in resolving the discrepancies; and (3) informing the employer that a copy of such notice is being forwarded to assist the Secretary of Homeland Security in the enforcement of applicable federal immigration laws relating to employment of individuals who are not authorized to work in the United States. Requires the Commissioner to forward such a copy to the Secretary of Homeland Security, including the information in which discrepancies appear."
