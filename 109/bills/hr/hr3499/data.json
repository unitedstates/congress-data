Requires such state authorization of the program's operation before any federal officer, employee, or authority may enforce any requirement of the program against a state authority, and before any state authority may be obliged to obey any such requirement.Prohibits the Secretary from providing any funds under an ESEA program to a local governmental entity unless the state's chief law enforcement officer certifies that participation by the entity in the program is consistent with any applicable requirements under state law."
