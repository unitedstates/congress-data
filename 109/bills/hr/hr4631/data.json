Requires the President to suspend any federal regulation, as recommended by the Commission, unless Congress disapproves of such suspension. Sets forth congressional procedures for consideration of a joint resolution disapproving the Commission's recommendations. Allows reinstatement of a suspended regulation by its administering department or agency pursuant to a determination that the benefits of the reinstatement outweigh the costs. Subjects such determination to direction from or reversal by the President."
