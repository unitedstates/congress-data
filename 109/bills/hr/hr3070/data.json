    "text": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005 - Title I: General Principles and Reports - ( Sec. 101) Directs the Administrator (the Administrator) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to ensure that NASA carries out a balanced set of programs that include: (1) human space flight; (2) aeronautics research and development; and (3) scientific research. Requires the Administrator to manage human space flight programs to strive to achieve: (1) returning Americans to the moon by 2020; (2) launching the Crew Exploration Vehicle close to 2010; (3) increasing knowledge of the impacts of long stays in space on the human body; and (4) enabling humans to land on and return from Mars and other destinations. Directs the President, through the Administrator, to develop a national aeronautics policy to guide NASA aeronautics programs through 2020, which shall include priority areas of research through FY2011. Directs the Administrator to develop: (1) a policy to guide NASA science programs through 2016 which includes addressing plans for a human mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope; and (2) a plan for managing NASA's facilities through FY2015. Directs the Administrator to develop a human capital strategy through FY2011 to ensure that NASA has an appropriate workforce to carry out NASA programs. Requires NASA to provide a draft of the strategy to its federal employee unions for a 30-day consultation period. Prohibits NASA from: (1) initiating any buyout offer until 60 days after the strategy has been transmitted to Congress; and (2) implementing any Reduction in Force or other involuntary separations (except for cause) prior to February 16, 2007. Requires the Administrator to study whether any of NASA's centers should be operated by or with the private sector by converting a center to a federally funded research and development center or through any other mechanism. Describes the documents that shall accompany proposed NASA budgets submitted by the President. Requires NASA to make available information on corporate and center general and administrative costs and service pool costs. Requires the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to commission an independent review of the Nation's long-term strategic needs for test facilities. Prohibits the Administrator from closing or mothballing any aeronautical test facilities identified in a specified 2003 independent assessment by the RAND Corporation as being part of the minimum set of those facilities necessary to retain and serve national needs, as well as any other non-aeronautical NASA test facilities that were in use as of January 1, 2004, until such review has been transmitted to Congress. (Sec. 102) Directs the Administrator to submit specified separate reports concerning: (1) the International Space Station (ISS), including the operation of the ISS in the event that the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 is not amended; (2) the use of the Space Shuttle before its retirement; (3) the launch vehicle for the Crew Exploration vehicle; (4) any heavy lift vehicle NASA intends to develop; (5) lunar missions; (6) Project Prometheus; and (7) the cost increase for the James Webb Space Telescope. Prohibits the Administrator from entering into a development contract for the Crew Exploration Vehicle until at least 30 days after the Administrator has transmitted a report describing: (1) the expected cost of such vehicle through FY2020; (2) the expected budgets for each fiscal year through FY2020 for human space flight, aeronautics, space science, and earth science; and (3) the extent to which such vehicle will allow for the escape of crew in an emergency.
