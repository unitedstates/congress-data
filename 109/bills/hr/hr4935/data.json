    "text": "Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness and Indian Peaks Wilderness Expansion Act- Designates certain lands in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, as wilderness and components of the National Wilderness Preservation System, which shall be known as the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish an alignment line for a trail, which shall be known as the East Shore Trail, located within the East Shore Trail Area and, after establishing the alignment line, to identify the boundaries of such Trail. Provides for the inclusion of the East Shore Trail in the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness if such Trail has not been constructed and authorized for use by motorized bicycles 25 years after enactment of this Act. Bars, until 25 years after this Act's enactment, the use of motorized vehicles or other motorized machinery not permitted on March 1, 2006, from being allowed in the East Shore Trail Area, except for constructing or maintaining the East Shore Trail, if such construction is authorized by the Secretary. Amends the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area, Arapaho National Recreation Area and the Oregon Islands Wilderness Area Act to provide for a boundary adjustment of the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area and the Arapaho National Recreation Area by: (1) increasing the acreage of the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area; and (2) decreasing the acreage of the Arapaho National Recreation Area."
