Revises public interest standard provisions to require a station licensee using advanced television spectrum to broadcast multiple channels of programming in the digital television service to establish that program services on such spectrum are in the public interest by meeting specified broadcasting requirements for local civic affairs or qualifying local electoral affairs, independently or locally produced programming, and children's educational programming. Requires at least two public hearings annually to ascertain community needs and interests. Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to issue specified final decisions and complete a specified rulemaking proceeding within nine months of enactment of this Act."
