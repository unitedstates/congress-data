Revises requirements for transportation: (1) research strategic planning to include development priorities; and (2) deployment grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts. Directs the Secretary to establish a program to demonstrate the application of innovative technology in surface transportation infrastructure construction and safety. Directs the Secretary to arrange with the National Academy of Sciences for establishment of a Future Strategic Highway Research Program. Amends the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century to revise the Intelligent Transportation Systems Act of 1998 and rename it the Intelligent Transportation Systems Act of 2005. Directs the Secretary to establish a National Multimodal Trends Policy Research Program that systematically addresses critical short-term, medium-term, and long-term social science issues affecting and affected by the transportation system. Authorizes appropriations for FY 2005 through 2010 for transit research and development. Amends Federal highway law to direct the Secretary to establish an Innovative Practices and Technologies Demonstration and Deployment Program. Directs the Secretary to establish: (1) a multimodal energy and climate change program to study the relationship of transportation, energy, and climate change as part of the National Climate Change Technology Initiative and the Climate Change Research Initiative; and (2) a national cooperative freight transportation research program."
