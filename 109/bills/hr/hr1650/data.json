Defines \"qualified stem cell research bond\" as any bond issued by a State or local government, 95 percent of the proceeds of which are to be used for interdisciplinary scientific and medical research relating to stem cells, therapy development relating to stem cells, and development of pharmacologies and treatments through clinical trials relating to stem cells. Imposes certain limitations on the use of stem cells that are supported by a bond issuance under this Act. Sets a national limitation in 2006 through 2008 of $10 billion on the issuance of stem cell research bonds. Terminates the authority to issue such bonds after FY 2008."
