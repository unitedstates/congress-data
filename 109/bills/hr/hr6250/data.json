Extends the time limitation for the use of such entitlement to ten years after separation from the Selected Reserve (currently, ten years after the person first becomes entitled to such assistance). Requires the Secretary (currently, the Secretaries of each military department) to establish and maintain a program to provide educational assistance to members of the Ready Reserve. Extends the time limitation for the use of such entitlement to ten years after separation from the Ready Reserve."
