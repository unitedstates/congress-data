    "text": "Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006 - Title I: Emergency Relief for Eligible Areas - (Sec. 101) Amends provisions of title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act (popularly known as the Ryan White Care Act [RWCA]) concerning emergency relief grants for metropolitan areas to assist in delivering and enhancing HIV-related services. Continues an eligible metropolitan area's (EMA) eligibility to receive such a grant until such area does not, for three consecutive years, have: (1) 2,000 cases of reported and confirmed cases of AIDS during the most recent period of 5 calendar years for which such data is available; and (2) a cumulative total of 3,000 or more living cases of AIDS as of December 31 of the most recent calendar year. Sets as the boundaries for an EMA as either: (1) the boundaries that were in effect for FY1994; or (2) the boundaries that are in effect when such area initially receives funding. Amends the definition of \"metropolitan area\" to require a population of 50,000 or more individuals. (Sec. 102) Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to disburse 66 2/3% (currently, 50%) of the amount made available for emergency relief grants based on the number of reported and confirmed living names-based cases of HIV/AIDS. Provides for: (1) a transition for reporting living names-based non-AIDS cases of HIV; and (2) exemptions for states that have a plan for making such a transition. Requires the Secretary to modify the number of cases reported for states using code-based reporting to adjust for duplicative reporting in and among systems. Requires the Secretary to carry out a program to monitor names-based reporting. Limits the increase in grants for EMAs using code-based reporting. Requires the Secretary to increase the amount of the grant for EMAs using code-based reporting to ensure that the amount of the grants for FY2007-FY2009 do not decrease by more than a certain percentage for such fiscal years. (Sec. 103) Requires the Secretary to disburse supplemental grants on the basis of demonstrated need (currently, severe need). Sets forth the factors the Secretary may consider in determining demonstrated need, including the unmet need for services and relevant factors that limit access to health care. Requires the Secretary to provide such supplemental grants to an eligible area to address the decline or disruption of all EMA-provided services related to the decline in the amounts received for emergency relief grants consistent with the FY2006 grant award. (Sec. 104) Makes emergency relief grants and supplemental grants available for obligation by the EMA for one year. Directs the Secretary to: (1) cancel any unobligated balance of an award for a supplemental grant and require the return of any balance; (2) make such amounts available for supplemental grants; (3) cancel any unobligated balance of an award for an emergency relief grant and require the return of any balance, unless the chief elected official of the area submits, and the Secretary approves, a waiver; and (4) reduce the amount of an emergency relief grant by the same amount as the unobligated balance, with exceptions. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the amount of supplemental funds available and how such funds are disbursed. (Sec. 105) Prohibits the Secretary from making an emergency relief grant to an eligible area unless the funds provided are only used for core medical services, support services, and administrative expenses. Requires the chief elected official to: (1) provide direct financial assistance to entities for the provision of core medical services and support services; and (2) use not less than 75% of the grant for core medical services that are needed in the eligible area for individuals with HIV/AIDS who are identified and eligible under RWCA. Requires the Secretary to waive such requirement if: (1) there is no waiting list for AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) services; and (2) core medical services are available to all eligible individuals. Defines core medical services, support services, and early intervention services. Requires the chief elected official to use not less than the percentage constituted by the ratio of the population of women, infants, children, and youth with HIV/AIDS to the general population of individuals with HIV/AIDS for providing health and support services to infants, children, youth and women with HIV/AIDS. (Sec. 106) Requires the HIV health services planning council representatives to include members of a federally recognized Indian tribe and individuals co-infected with hepatitis B or C. Excludes a program administered by or providing the services of the Indian Health Service from requirements that prohibit the use of grant funds to make payments for any item or service paid for by another program or insurance policy. Requires the chief elected official to submit to the lead state agency audits regarding funds expended under emergency relief grants every two years and include necessary client-based data to compile unmet need calculations and statewide coordinated statements of need process. Requires an EMA's application for a grant to include: (1) the manner in which the expected expenditures are related to the planning process for states that receive funding; and (2) the expected expenditures and how those expenditures will improve overall client outcomes. (Sec. 107) Requires the Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), to establish a transitional grant program for metropolitan areas for which there have been at least 1,000 but fewer than 2,000 reported and confirmed cases of AIDS during the most recent period of five calendar years. Considers as a transitional area a metropolitan area that received an emergency relief grant for FY2006, but does not qualify for FY2007 as an EMA or as a transitional area. Provides that a metropolitan area continues to be a transitional area until the metropolitan area, for three consecutive years, does not: (1) quality as a transitional area; and (2) have a cumulative total of 1,500 or more living cases of AIDS. Applies requirements for emergency relief grants to transitional grants except that the chief elected official need not have an HIV health services planning council if the official otherwise obtains community input for formulating the overall plan for priority setting and allocating funds. Gives the Secretary discretion in allocating funds between emergency relief grants and transitional grants. (Sec. 108) Authorizes appropriations for FY2007-FY2009. Title II: Care Grants - (Sec. 201) Amends provisions relating to grants to enable states to improve the quality, availability, and organization of health care and support services for individuals and families with HIV/AIDS (Care grants). Requires the state to use not less than 75% of such a grant to provide core medical services that are needed in the state for eligible individuals with HIV/AIDS, such as outpatient and ambulatory health services and medical case management. Requires the Secretary to waive such requirement if: (1) there is no waiting list for AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) services; and (2) core medical services are available to all eligible individuals with HIV/AIDS. (Sec. 202) Requires the Secretary to develop and maintain a list of classes of core ADAP antiretroviral therapeutics. Requires states to ensure that: (1) such therapeutics are the minimum required treatments provided by the state ADAP program; and (2) any drug rebates are applied to Care grant activities, with priority given to ADAP activities. (Sec. 203) Distributes grants to states and territories, including Guam and Virgin Islands, based on the total number of living HIV/AIDS cased based on names-based reporting. Provides for a transition period for such reporting. Requires the Secretary to: (1) reduce by 5% the number of living non-AIDS cases of HIV reported for a state to adjust for duplicative reporting in and among systems that use code-based reporting; and (2) carry out a program to monitor the reporting of names-based cases and to detect instances of inaccurate reporting.
