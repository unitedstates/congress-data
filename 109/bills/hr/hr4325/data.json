Increases the allowable amount of such credit to $5,000 for expenses for a program operated: (1) in an empowerment zone, enterprise community, or renewal community; (2) in a school district in which at least 50 percent of the students are eligible for free or reduced-cost lunches; (3) in an federally-declared disaster area; (4) in certain rural areas receiving federal assistance; (5) in an Indian tribal jurisdiction; (6) by an employer with 200 or fewer employees during a specified period; or (7) for a disabled individual. Defines \"information technology education and training program expenses\" to include: (1) course work; (2) certification testing; (3) apprenticeship programs registered by the Department of Labor; and (4) other expenses essential to assessing skill acquisition. Redefines \"eligible educational institution\" to include a commercial information and communications technology training provider. Establishes an Information Technology Training Certification Advisory Board to develop: (1) guidelines for computer science, information technology, and related college courses; and (2) a list of the information technology training and certifications that qualify for the tax credit established by this Act."
