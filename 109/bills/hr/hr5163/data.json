    "text": "Federal and Small Business Telework Promotion Act - Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to require each federal agency to take necessary actions to reduce the level of fuel consumed by vehicles of employees of such agency (other than fuel for military purposes) by ten percent or more during the one-year period following enactment of this section. Outlines methods to achieve such reduction, including telework and carpooling. Directs the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to conduct, in not more than five of the SBA's regions, a pilot program to raise awareness about telework among small business employers and to encourage such employers to offer telework options to employees. Requires the Administrator to make special efforts to conduct outreach to businesses owned by or employing individuals with disabilities, including disabled American veterans, and agencies, groups, or organizations that aid such individuals. Terminates such program after two years."
