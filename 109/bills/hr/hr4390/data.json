Increases penalties for: (1) knowingly making false statements or furnishing false or misrepresented identification regarding any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale or other disposition of such firearm or ammunition; or (2) making false entries in, or failing to properly maintain, required firearms records.Authorizes the Attorney General to suspend a firearms dealer's license and to assess a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for firearms violations, including failure to have secure gun storage or safety devices (current penalties are limited to license revocation).Permits any licensed firearms dealer who is indicted for a felony to continue to operate until the date of conviction (currently, until the conviction becomes final).Authorizes appropriations for the hiring and training of 500 additional inspectors for the Department of Justice's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives."
