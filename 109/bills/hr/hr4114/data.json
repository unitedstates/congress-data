Directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to promulgate rules to enforce this Act, and to establish what constitutes an unjust or unreasonable price, taking the following factors into consideration: (1) the relation of the price to the prevailing price of that commodity in the market in the same geographic region during the previous 12-month period; (2) shipping, manufacturing, or other costs to the entity; (3) whether there has been a national or regional disruption in the supply of the commodity; and (4) whether there is any indication of the entity taking unfair advantage of any circumstances. Prescribes FTC enforcement guidelines, including civil and criminal penalties."
