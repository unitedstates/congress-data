Limits the federal share of the capital costs of the Project to 25%. Directs the Secretary, before obligating funds, to work cooperatively to use plans, designs, and engineering and environmental analyses that have already been prepared by the District for the Project. Terminates the Secretary's authority to carry out this Act 10 years after its enactment."
