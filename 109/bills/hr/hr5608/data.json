Directs the Secretary to conduct and support research to: (1) improve the identification of older adults who have a high risk of falling; (2) improve data collection and analysis to identify fall risk and protective factors; (3) design, implement, and evaluate the most effective fall prevention and medication management interventions; (4) tailor strategies to reduce falls to specific populations of older adults; (5) maximize the dissemination of proven, effective fall prevention interventions; (6) improve the diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of elderly fall victims; and (7) assess the risks of falls occurring in various settings. Requires the Secretary to: (1) conduct research concerning barriers to the adoption of proven interventions, approaches to reduce falls among high-risk older adults living in long-term care facilities, and strategies in home modifications; (2) evaluate the effectiveness of community programs; (3) provide for a website to serve as an information clearinghouse; (4) oversee and support demonstration projects designed to reduce the risk of falls in frail older adults emphasizing projects that foster collaboration between health care providers and the aging services network or residential and institutional settings; and (5) report to Congress on the effects of falls on health care costs, the potential for reducing falls, and the most effective strategies for reducing associated health care costs."
