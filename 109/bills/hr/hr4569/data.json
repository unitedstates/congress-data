Prohibits a person from encoding a program using the rights signaling system unless the encoding meets specified content security requirements. Provides civil remedies and criminal penalties for violations. Authorizes the Director of the Patent and Trademark Office to adopt commercially reasonable improvements to the detection function of the Video Encoded Invisible Light (VEIL) technology portion of the rights signaling system. Outlines compliance standards for video input conversion devices."
