States that such authority shall last for six months after enactment of this Act. Authorizes additional appropriations for such assistance. Authorizes the Secretary, during the six-month period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, to assist low-income families and persons under the rural housing voucher program if: (1) such family or person resided, on August 25, 2005, in any area designated as a disaster or emergency area in connection with Hurricane Katrina, or resided, on September 24, 2005, in any area designated as a disaster or emergency area in connection with Hurricane Rita; and (2) the residence of such family or person became uninhabitable or inaccessible as result of such a disaster or emergency. Eliminates the rural housing voucher program fiscal year unit limit. Amends the Doug Bereuter section 502 single family housing loan guarantee program to permit loan and refinancing guarantees for home repair or rehabilitation."
