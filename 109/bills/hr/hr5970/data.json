    "text": "Estate Tax and Extension of Tax Relief Act of 2006 - Title I: Reform and Extension of Estate Tax After 2009 - (Sec. 101) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to restore the unified estate and gift tax exclusion after 2009 and phase in an increase in such exclusion from $3.75 million in 2010 to $5 million in 2015. Adjusts the $5 million exclusion amount for inflation after 2015. Lowers the estate tax rate to equal the current long-term capital gains tax rate (i.e., 15% through 2010) for taxable estates up to $25 million. Phases in a reduction of the estate tax rate for taxable estates over $25 million from 40% in 2010 to 30% in 2015 and thereafter. Adjusts the $25 million threshold amount for inflation after 2015. Repeals after 2009 the estate tax deduction for estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes paid to states.
