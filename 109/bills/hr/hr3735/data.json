Provides that the FMAP applicable to a state for FY2006 after the application of this limitation on reduction shall apply only for purposes of titles XIX (Medicaid) and XXI (State Children's Health Insurance (SCHIP)) of the Social Security Act (SSA), as well as payments under such titles that are based on a certain enhanced FMAP, and shall not apply with respect to payments under SSA title IV (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)). Repeals this Act effective October 1, 2006, and declares that it shall not apply to any fiscal year after FY2006."
