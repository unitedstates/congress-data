    "text": "TV Truth Act of 2005 - Makes it unlawful for a manufacturer to ship in interstate commerce an analog television unless there is displayed clearly and conspicuously, as a removable label on the screen of such television, a disclosure, in both English and Spanish, stating that such analog television will no longer receive a broadcast signal without additional equipment as early as December 31, 2006, when federal law will require broadcast television transmission to change from analog to digital service (with a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) phone number for further information). Makes it unlawful for any distributor to sell at retail or rent such a television unless the distributor places adjacent to such television a sign containing such disclosure. Provides for enforcement through the Federal Trade Commission."
