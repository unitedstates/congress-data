    "text": "Temporary Agricultural Labor Reform Act of 2003 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to revise employer and employee association application requirements for admission of H-2A temporary agricultural workers, including assurances: (1) that the job opportunity is temporary or seasonal, and is not the result of a labor dispute; (2) that attempts have been made to hire U.S. workers; (3) respecting wages and benefits, and labor law compliance; (4) respecting nondisplacement of U.S. workers; and (5) respecting placement with other employers. Revises related provisions respecting: (1) penalties; and (2) admissions and extensions of stay. Provides special provisions for alien sheepherders, goatherders, and dairy workers. Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to: (1) authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to make grants to H-2A employers for the transportation costs of workers whose employment is cut short by natural disaster; and (2) direct the Secretary to establish an H-2A Worker Program Ombudsman within the Office of the Chief Economist of the Department of Agriculture. Amends the Immigrant Reform and Control Act of 1986 to limit the conditions under which the Legal Services Corporation may: (1) provide legal assistance for, or on behalf of, any alien; (2) bring a civil action for damages on behalf of an H-2A nonimmigrant (requires prior mediation); and (3) enter onto an employer's property."
