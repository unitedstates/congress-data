    "text": "Livestock Identification and Marketing Opportunities Act - Establishes the Livestock Identification Board which shall: (1) establish an electronic livestock identification system (livestock system) that is capable of tracing all U.S. livestock from the time of first movement from its original premise to the time of slaughter in less than 48 hours, and tracking all relevant livestock information (identification number, species, date of birth); (2) maintain a centralized livestock data system; and (3) determine the official livestock system identification technology. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) establish a U.S. premise identification system; and (2) verify that each animal, or group of animals subject to the livestock system, is properly identified upon first entry of the animal into commerce. Authorizes the owner of an animal or group of animals that is not subject to the livestock livestock system to voluntarily subject such animal, or group of animals, to system tracking. Exempts information obtained through the livestock or premise systems from Freedom of Information Act disclosure. States that information obtained through the livestock or premise systems: (1) may not be released; (2) shall not be considered public domain information; and (3) shall be considered privileged and confidential commercial information. Authorizes the Board to release livestock or premise system information for reasons of public health or disease or pest control. Requires the Board to release livestock or premise system information to: (1) a livestock owner upon request; (2) the Secretary, a state, or a tribal agency for animal disease surveillance; (3) the Attorney General for criminal investigation or prosecution; (4) the Secretary of Homeland Security for national security; (5) the Secretary of Health and Human Services for public health protection; and (6) a foreign government if necessary to trace livestock threatened by disease or pest, as determined by the Secretary. Defines \"livestock\" as cattle, swine, sheep, goats, and poultry."
