    "text": "Coral Reef Conservation and Protection Act of 2005 - Makes it unlawful to: (1) take any covered coral reef species within U.S. waters; (2) import into or export from the United States any covered coral reef species; (3) possess, sell, purchase, deliver, carry, transport, or receive in interstate or foreign commerce any covered coral reef species taken or imported illegally; or (4) attempt a prohibited act involving a covered coral reef species. Defines \"covered coral reef species\" to include any species of coral or ornamental reef fish listed in or added to Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Exempts from the prohibitions of this Act covered coral reef species taken incidentally or for: (1) a qualified scientifically-based management plan; (2) a cooperative breeding program; (3) an aquaculture and mariculture facility; (4) scientific, museum, or zoological purposes; or (5) personal consumption. Denies an exemption for species taken using any destructive collection practice (e.g., reef-dredging, explosions, or poisons). Authorizes the Secretary of State to consult with foreign governments to encourage the protection of coral reef species and to take steps to eliminate destructive collection practices. Directs the Secretaries of the Interior and of Commerce to coordinate with the Coral Reef Task Force for the conservation and management of coral reef ecosystems. Establishes civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act."
