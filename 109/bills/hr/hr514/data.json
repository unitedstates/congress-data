Permits administering either vaccine to any such member without the informed consent of the member. Requires the correction of the records of servicemembers previously punished for refusing to take either vaccine. Requires the Secretary of Defense to assess the current threat of an anthrax or smallpox attack on members of the Armed Forces and report the results. Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to: (1) carry out an ongoing assessment of the adverse health effects being reported by members and former members of the Armed Forces with respect to the smallpox and anthrax vaccines administered by the Department of Defense; and (2) prepare an estimate of the future cost to the Department of Veterans Affairs to treat those adverse health effects, if determined to be service-connected. Requires the President to establish a National Center for Military Deployment Health Research to coordinate and synthesize research efforts by Federal departments and agencies relating to the health effects of military deployments on members of the Armed Forces, including members of the reserve components."
