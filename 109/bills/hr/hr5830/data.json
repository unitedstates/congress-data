    "text": "Wright Amendment Reform Act - Amends the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979, with respect to provisions concerning air transportation to or from Love Field, Texas (the Wright Amendment), to authorize domestic air carriers and foreign air carriers (with respect to foreign air transportation) to offer for sale and provide through service and ticketing air transportation to or from Love Field, Texas, and any U.S. or foreign destination through any point within Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Alabama (effectively expanding domestic and foreign air service to and from Love Field, Texas). Terminates such provisions (including the amendment made by this Act) eight years after enactment of this Act. Prohibits: (1) a person from providing nonstop air passenger service for compensation between Love Field, Texas, and any point or points outside the 50 states or the District of Columbia; and (2) a federal official or employee from designating Love Field, Texas, as an initial point of entry into the United States or a last point of departure from the United States. Limits charter flights at Love Field, Texas, to: (1) destinations within the 50 states and the District of Columbia; and (2) no more than 10 per month per air carrier for charter flights beyond the states of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Alabama. Requires: (1) air carriers, with specified exceptions, who lease gate space for flights to and from Love Field, Texas, to depart from and arrive at such gates; and (2) operators of charter flights from Love Field, Texas, who do not lease gate space to depart from nonterminal facilities or one of the terminal gates at Love Field, Texas. Deems any action taken by the city of Dallas, the city of Forth Worth, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport Board to implement a certain agreement to resolve the \"Wright Amendment Issues\" dated July 11, 2006, to be in compliance with certain obligations under federal transportation. Declares that nothing in such agreement shall affect general aviation service at Love Field, Texas. Directs the city of Dallas, Texas, to reduce the number of gates available for air service at Love Field, Texas, to no more than 20 gates (and, thereafter, with a limit not to exceed a maximum of 20 gates). Grants the Department of Transportation (DOT) exclusive authority to review actions taken under this Act."
