QI, TMA, and Abstinence Programs Extension and Hurricane Katrina Unemployment Relief Act of 2005 - Title I: Health Provisions - Amends XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to extend from September 2005 through September 2007 the qualified individual program (under which medical assistance is available for Medicare cost-sharing for individuals who would be qualified Medicare beneficiaries but for the fact that their income exceeds the state-established income level, and is between 120% and 135% of the official poverty line). Prescribes additional allocations for such program for the extended period. Extends through December 31, 2005, Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA) and the separate program for abstinence education. Eliminates Medicare and Medicaid coverage under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act of drugs used for the treatment of sexual or erectile dysfunction, beginning in 2007. Title II: Assistance Relating to Unemployment - Amends title IX of the Social Security Act to direct the Secretary to transfer from the federal unemployment account: (1) $15 million to the account of Alabama in the Unemployment Trust Fund; (2) $400 million to the account of Louisiana in the Unemployment Trust Fund; and (3) $85 million to the account of Mississippi in the Unemployment Trust Fund. Authorizes any state to use any amounts received by such state pursuant to title III of the Social Security Act to assist in the administration of claims for compensation on behalf of any other state, if a major disaster was declared with respect to such other state or any area within it, under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, by reason of Hurricane Katrina."
