    "text": "Preparedness First Act of 2006 - Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to authorize grants from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to states, regions, or eligible tribes to improve the ability of emergency response providers to prevent, prepare for, respond to, mitigate against, or recover from natural or manmade disasters, including terrorist attacks. Requires the Secretary of DHS to: (1) award grants to assist states and local governments in achieving, maintaining, and enhancing essential capabilities for emergency preparedness; (2) require states applying for grants to submit a three-year state emergency preparedness plan that meets specified requirements; and (3) evaluate and annually prioritize all pending grant applications based upon the degree to which they would lessen the threat to, vulnerability of, and consequences for persons and critical infrastructure, based upon the most current risk assessment. Directs or authorizes the Secretary to establish: (1) the Emergency Management Performance Grants Program (including technical assistance and grants to improve, maintain, and update state emergency preparedness plans); (2) the State Homeland Security Grant Program (grants to fund state homeland security material expenses related to all-hazards disaster response and recovery efforts); (3) the Metropolitan Medical Response System Program (to assist highly populated jurisdictions to achieve enhanced capabilities necessary to meet medical logistical challenges posed by mass casualty events); and (4) the Urban Area Security Initiative (grants to designated states and local government entities to enhance emergency response provider capabilities). Directs the Secretary to establish in the Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) an Office of the Comptroller to oversee ODP's grants distribution process and financial management."
