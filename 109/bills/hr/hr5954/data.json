Requires the Intelligence Committee to notify appropriate standing committees of any classified information received by it that falls within such a committee's jurisdiction. Requires Intelligence Committee members who also serve on the standing committee, in coordination with its chairman, to brief the entire membership on such classified information. Provides for Intelligence Committee assistance to standing committees requesting a briefing on classified information held by executive branch offices. Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to conform to this Act."
