Increases amounts made available from such Fund for FY 2006 and 2007 for discretionary grants (with priority given to fulfill obligations under letters of intent to airport sponsors for airport security improvement projects). Establishes the Checkpoint Screening Security Fund in the Department of Homeland Security. Makes a specified amount from the Aviation Security Capital Fund available for deposit into the Checkpoint Screening Security Fund. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to impose a passenger fee and deposit amounts collected into such Fund."
