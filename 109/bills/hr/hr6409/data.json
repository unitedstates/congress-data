Requires the Secretary of the Interior to convey, to the state of Idaho a specified parcel or parcels of BLM land, including roads thereon, for a motorized recreation park. Designates specified parcels of federal land in central Idaho as wilderness areas to be managed as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System (NWPS). Repeals existing law requiring review of portions of the Sawtooth National Recreation Area (SNRA) for possible inclusion in the NWPS. Establishes the Boulder-White Cloud Management Area on federal lands in the Challis National Forest, the Sawtooth National Forest, SNRA, and Challis District of the BLM that are not designated as wilderness areas under this Act."
