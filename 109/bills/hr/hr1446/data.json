Amends the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act to restrict the importation of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine, with an exception. Requires the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy to report to Congress regarding the regulation of list I chemicals, including whether some or all of such chemicals should be included in schedule V for controlled substances. Authorizes appropriations for training to State and local prosecutors and law enforcement agents for the investigation and prosecution of methamphetamine offenses. Permits the hiring of personnel and the purchase of equipment to assist in enforcement and prosecution and in the cleanup of methamphetamine-affected areas. Directs the Attorney General to allocate appropriated funds for the hiring and training of special assistant United States attorneys. Amends the Public Health Service Act to provide grants for: (1) the development of drug endangered children rapid response teams to intervene on behalf of children exposed to methamphetamine; (2) methamphetamine abuse treatment, with priority for rural areas; and (3) a methamphetamine research, training, and technical assistance center. Authorizes the Attorney General, acting through the Bureau of Justice Assistance, to award grants to States to establish methamphetamine precursor monitoring programs."
