Includes, for purposes of such coverage, service during the Persian Gulf War or any subsequent conflict in which depleted uranium munitions are used. Directs the Secretary to provide for the conduct of an independent in-depth medical study to determine other diseases that may result from exposure to depleted uranium. Requires study results to be submitted to the congressional veterans' committees."
