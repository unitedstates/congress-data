    "text": "Strengthening America's Innovation and Competitiveness Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to award competitive grants to states and to partnerships of institutions of higher education and high need local educational agencies (LEAs) to implement strategies to increase the number of teachers qualified to teach advanced placement and pre-advanced placement courses in mathematics, science, and critical foreign languages. Replaces the Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship program with the Robert C. Byrd Mathematics and Science Honors Scholarship program. Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award funds to a private nonprofit organization to administer, through a public-private partnership, a Mathematics and Science Honors Scholarships program for postsecondary and graduate students who commit to five consecutive years of service in a science, engineering, or mathematics field. Authorizes the Secretary to cover the student loan interest obligations of mathematics, science, or engineering professionals and elementary and secondary school teachers who make such an obligation. Authorizes grants to states for: (1) activities promoting the professional development of elementary and secondary school teachers; and (2) state mathematics and science education coordinating councils where education, business, and community leaders collaborate to improve teacher recruitment and training and student performance in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Authorizes grants to LEAs and public or private educational organizations to recruit and train individuals outside of the elementary and secondary education system who have expertise in mathematics, science, and critical foreign languages to teach such subjects at secondary schools on an adjunct basis. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to partnerships of institutions of higher education and LEAs to: (1) establish elementary and secondary school critical foreign language teacher recruitment and preparation programs; and (2) provide innovative critical language learning opportunities for students."
