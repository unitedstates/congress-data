Requires a state which provides medical assistance for covered outpatient drugs to pay a dispensing fee for each covered outpatient drug. Allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop a methodology to set the FUL based on the reported retail survey price instead of a percentage of RAMP or volume weighted average RAMP. Exempts the Secretary's FUL and RAMP determinations from administrative or judicial review. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on: (1) the appropriateness in payment levels to pharmacies for dispensing fees under the Medicaid program; and (2) whether the estimated average payment amounts to pharmacies for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid program after implementation of this Act are below the average prices paid by pharmacies for acquiring such drugs. Directs the Inspector General of the Department of HHS to report to Congress on the appropriateness of using RAMPs and retail survey prices, rather than the average manufacturer prices or other price measures, as the basis for establishing a FUL for reimbursement for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid program. (Sec. 3102) Requires states to submit to the Secretary utilization data and coding information for single source outpatient drugs administered by a physician on or after January 1, 2006, so that the Secretary is able to collect rebates for those drugs. Requires states to submit to the Secretary utilization and coding information for multiple source drugs using National Drug Code codes, unless the Secretary specifies that an alternative coding system should be used.

Requires a prior authorization system to provide, in addition, that, if a response is not received to a request for authorization of such a drug within 24 hours after the prescription is transmitted, payment is made for a 30 day supply of the medication. Chapter 2: Reform of Asset Transfer Rules - (Sec. 3111) Lengthens the look-back period to 60 months for income and assets disposed of by the individual after enactment of this Act. Changes the start date of the ineligibility period for all transfers made on or after enactment of this Act, to the first day of a month during or after which assets have been transferred for less than fair market value (as under current law), or the date on which the individual is eligible for medical assistance under the state plan and is receiving certain nursing home or other related long-term care services, whichever is later, and which does not occur during any period of ineligibility as a result of an asset transfer policy. Specifies the criteria by which an application for an undue hardship waiver would be approved (by codifying current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidance on state procedure). Permits facilities in which institutionalized individuals reside to file undue hardship waiver applications on behalf of the individual, with the institutionalized individual's consent or the consent of his or her legal guardian. Provides that if the pending application for undue hardship of nursing facility residents meets criteria specified by the Secretary, the state may provide for payments for nursing facility services to hold the bed for these individuals at a facility for up to 30 days while the application remains pending. (Sec. 3112) Requires a state, as a condition for providing medical assistance for long-term care services, to require an individual's application or recertification for such assistance to disclose specified information, including: (1) any interest the individual or community spouse has in an annuity, regardless of whether the annuity is irrevocable or is treated as an asset; and (2) full information about any transaction during the previous 60-month period involving the transfer or disposal of assets exceeding $100,000. Requires an applicant, on any application or recertification form, to designate the state as the remainder beneficiary in the first position under such an annuity or similar financial instrument for the total amount of any medical assistance paid on behalf of the individual. (Sec. 3113) Requires that any transfer or allocation from an institutionalized spouse to meet an income need of a community spouse be made first from the institutionalized spouse's income (income-first method), and then secondly from the institutionalized spouse's resources only when that spouse's income is not available. (Sec. 3114) Excludes from Medicaid eligibility for nursing facility or other long-term care services those individuals with an equity interest in their home of more than $750,000. Requires an annual increase in such amount, beginning in 2011, based on the percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers. Exempts from this exclusion any individuals whose spouse, or whose child under age 21 (or blind or permanently and totally disabled) lawfully resides in the individual's home. Directs the Secretary to establish a process to waive application of this exclusion for demonstrated hardship cases. (Sec. 3115) Allows state-licensed, registered, certified, or equivalent continuing care retirement communities or life communities to require in their admissions contracts that residents spend their resources, declared for the purpose of admission, on their care before they apply for Medicaid. Considers certain entrance fees for continuing care retirement communities or life care communities to be countable resources available to the applicant for purposes of the Medicaid eligibility determination if certain conditions are met. Requires such fees, among other things, to be usable to pay for an individual's care if other resources or income are insufficient to do so. Chapter 3: Flexibility in Cost-Sharing and Benefits - (Sec. 3121) Allows a state, at its option and through a state plan amendment, to impose premiums and cost-sharing for any group of individuals and for any type of services consistent with specified limitations, including waiver of premium for individuals with family income below 100% of the poverty level, and a 5% of family income cost-sharing limit for families below or above 100% of the poverty level. Specifies other types of beneficiaries exempt from premiums and services exempt from cost-sharing. Allows states to: (1) condition the provision of medical assistance on the prepayment of premiums, and to terminate eligibility for such assistance for failure to pay a premium if that failure continues for at least 60 days; (2) waive premium payments in such cases where such payments would impose an undue hardship; and (3) permit Medicaid providers to require a Medicaid beneficiary to pay authorized cost-sharing as a condition for the provision of care or services. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the impact of Medicaid premiums and cost-sharing on access to, and utilization of, services. (Sec. 3122) Allows states to impose higher cost-sharing amounts for non-preferred drugs within a class, and waive or reduce the cost-sharing otherwise applicable for lower-cost preferred drugs within such class in order to encourage the use of such lower-cost drugs. Specifies limits for any increase in cost-sharing for non-preferred drugs for beneficiaries under certain income levels. Prohibits a state from: (1) treating as a non-preferred drug any drug treated as a preferred drug under the TRICARE pharmacy benefit program; or (2) imposing cost-sharing that exceeds the cost-sharing imposed under TRICARE standards. Prohibits a state from providing for increased cost-sharing unless it has implemented for outpatient prescription drugs a system for prior authorization and an appeals process for related determinations.

Directs the Secretary to provide for grant payments to states for establishment of alternate non-emergency service providers or networks of such providers. (Sec. 3124) Allows states, at their option through a state plan amendment, to provide Medicaid benefits to certain groups of beneficiaries through benchmark coverage (standard Blue Cross/Blue Shield preferred provider option service benefit plan, state employee health benefit plan, or certain health maintenance organization (HMO) plans), including dental coverage for children, or specified benchmark equivalent coverage. (Sec. 3125) Authorizes a non-emergency medical transportation brokerage program, at state option, to provide transportation more cost-effectively to Medicaid-eligible individuals who need access to medical care or services and have no other means of transportation. (Sec. 3126) Exempts women covered under the Medicaid breast or cervical cancer program from application of the previous sections of this chapter. Chapter 4: Expanded Access to Certain Benefits - (Sec. 3131) Allows states to cover home and community-based services (HCBS) as an optional Medicaid benefit for individuals age 65 or over who meet specified criteria, without requiring a waiver. (Sec. 3132) Allows states to cover, under the Medicaid program, payment for part or all of the cost of self-directed personal assistance services (other than room and board) based on a written plan of care to certain individuals who would otherwise require and receive Medicaid personal care services or HCBS under a waiver. (Sec. 3133) Allows certain additional groups of individuals in states with state plan amendments approved after May 14, 1993, to be exempt from estate recovery requirements, if a plan amendment provides for a qualified state long-term care insurance partnership program. (Sec. 3134) Directs the Secretary to establish a demonstration program under which a state Medicaid plan may provide for health opportunity accounts for alternative benefits beginning January 1, 2006. Chapter 5: Other Provisions - (Sec. 3141) Amends SSA title XI to prescribe annual increases for FY2006-FY2007 in the cap on federal funding for the Medicaid programs in each of the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Marianas, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico.

Subtitle D: Digital Television Transition - Digital Television Transition Act of 2005 - (Sec. 3402) Sets forth congressional findings favoring a hard deadline for the transition in the United States from analog (spectrum-based) to digital (satellite signal-based) television (DTV), and thereby allowing the return of spectrum for public safety and wireless use. (Currently, there exists a deadline loophole allowing broadcasters to delay spectrum return until more than 85% of television (TV) households have at least one TV with access to digital broadcast channels.) (Sec. 3403) Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to: (1) make such deadline December 31, 2008; and (2) remove the 85% exception. Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to: (1) release by December 31, 2006, an FCC report and order assigning all full-power broadcast TV stations authorized in the DTV service a channel; (2) release by July 31, 2007, any reconsideration of such report and order; and (3) between July 31, 2007, and January 1, 2009, not adopt any further changes to such channels unless doing so is necessary for public safety or to prevent a delay in the end of broadcasting by full-power stations in the analog TV service.

(Sec. 3408) Prohibits any full-power TV station licensee that operates between 698 (currently, 746) and 806 megahertz from operating at that frequency after the end of the DTV service transition period. Allows a low-power TV station, TV translator station, or TV booster station to operate above 698 megahertz on a secondary basis in accordance with FCC rules, including those governing completion of the DTV service transition for low-power broadcasters. Directs the Assistant Secretary to use funds from the Low Power Digital-to-Analog Conversion Fund to implement and administer a program through which each eligible low-power TV station may receive compensation toward the purchase cost of a digital-to-analog conversion device that enables it to convert the incoming digital station of its corresponding full-power TV station to analog format transmission on the low-power TV station's analog channel. (Sec. 3409) Provides consumer education requirements for the FCC with respect to analog TV service. Requires manufacturers to place in a conspicuous place on analog TV receivers a notice that such receiver has only an analog broadcast tuner, that after December 31, 2008, TV broadcasters will broadcast only in digital format, and that, after such date, a converter box or cable or satellite service will be required to receive digital programming. Directs the FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to engage in a public outreach program to educate consumers regarding the DTV transition, and to report semiannually to specified congressional committees on such program. Requires additional public disclosures relating to the approach of the DTV deadline and related matters. Directs the FCC to provide certain requirements with respect to TV reception devices that have, or are sold in a bundle with, display screens.

Requires such rulemaking to be completed within 180 days. (Sec. 3412) Expresses the sense of Congress that the FCC should disseminate wireless communications licenses consistent with specified findings, and should utilize existing authority which requires the FCC to promote the following objectives: (1) the development and rapid deployment of new technologies, products, and services for the public; (2) promoting economic opportunity and competition and ensuring the public availability of new technologies; (3) recovery for the public of a portion of the value of spectrum made available for commercial use; and (4) efficient and intensive use of the electromagnetic spectrum. (Sec. 3413) Directs the FCC to: (1) commence a proceeding no later than June 1, 2006, to reevaluate the band plan for the auction of the unauctioned portions of the lower 700 megahertz band (currently designated as Blocks A, B, and E); and (2) reconfigure the band plan to license spectrum for Block B according to Cellular Market Areas and Rural Service Areas to facilitate the offering of competitive wireless services by regional and smaller wireless carriers. Title IV: Committee on Financial Services - Subtitle A: Deposit Insurance Reform - Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 - (Sec. 4002) Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) to merge the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund into the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF).

Revises the requirement that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) provide pass-through deposit insurance for the deposits of any employee benefit plan. Repeals the exception from such coverage requirement for any insured depository institution which, at the time such deposits are accepted, may not accept brokered deposits. Excepts from such coverage requirement, instead, any insured depository institution that is neither well-capitalized nor adequately capitalized, which may not accept such deposits. Amends the Federal Credit Union Act to: (1) change the insured amount of deposits to a net insured amount, according to a specified formula; (2) the maximum amount of deposit insurance coverage for instate municipal deposits according to a specified formula, but not to exceed $2 million; (3) double the standard maximum deposit insurance for certain retirement accounts; and (4) require the National Credit Union Administrator to provide pass-through share insurance of up to $130,000, adjusted for cost-of-living, for the deposits or shares of any employee benefit plan. (Sec. 4004) Amends the FDIA to replace assessment guidelines for achieving and maintaining a designated reserve ratio (DRR) and for independent treatment of deposit insurance funds. Requires the FDIC Board of Directors (Board) to set assessments as it determines appropriate, including a maximum base rate for assessments at one basis point for insured depository institutions in the lowest-risk category.
