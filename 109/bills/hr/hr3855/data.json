    "text": "Directs: (1) the Secretary of Agriculture to select 15% of the lands included in the National Forest System and to convey the lands selected by public sale; and (2) the Secretary of the Interior to identify 15% of the lands managed by agencies of the Department of the Interior (excluding lands in units of the National Park System and lands held for an Indian tribe) and convey the lands identified by public sale. Instructs such Secretaries to: (1) place an emphasis on identifying lands in those states where the United States owns more than 15% of the total land area; and (2) complete the identification of federal lands under this Act and commence the sale of such lands by October 1, 2006. Requires all proceeds from the sale of federal lands under this Act (other than amounts retained to cover the administrative costs incurred solely to conduct the sales) to be deposited in the Disaster Response and Relief Fund established by this Act. Makes amounts in the Disaster Response and Relief Fund available only for appropriation to cover or defray the costs of responding to a natural disaster or terrorist attack in an area covered by a disaster declaration made by the President. Provides that, until such Secretaries comply with the duties imposed on them under this Act, an interest in land may not be acquired by the Forest Service or an agency of the Department of the Interior unless the acquisition of that land is specifically authorized by an Act of Congress enacted after enactment of this Act."
