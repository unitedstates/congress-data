(Sec. 5) Allows Copyright Royalty Judges to make a partial distribution of cable and satellite royalty fees at any time after the filing of claims for distribution of such fees. (Current law authorizes a partial distribution during the pendency of a distribution proceeding.) (Sec. 6) Makes this Act effective as if it were included in the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004, except the partial distribution of royalty fees provisions are effective upon enactment of this Act."
