Requires the Director to: (1) establish and carry out a program, to be known as the Angel Finance Program, to provide financing to approved angel groups; (2) establish and maintain a searchable database, to be known as the Federal Angel Network, to assist small businesses in identifying angel investors; and (3) establish and carry out a program to make grants for the development of new or existing angel groups and to increase awareness and education about angel investing.
