Directs the Secretary to provide indemnity payments to poultry producers in hurricane-affected counties. Directs the Secretary to provide: (1) sugarcane and sugar beet disaster assistance for qualifying producers and first processors in Louisiana counties designated as disaster areas due to Hurricanes Katrina or Rita, or related conditions, or to qualifying producers and first processors in Florida for 2005 losses due to hurricanes, floods, rain, or storms; (2) assistance to sugarcane growers in Texas (for additional Baton Rouge demurrage costs and raw sugar transportation and storage costs) and Hawaii (for an agricultural transportation cooperative); (3) assistance to specialty and nursery crop producers in hurricane-affected counties; (4) assistance to tree producers (including Christmas, potted, ornamental, and nursery trees, shrubs, and vines), and fruit and nut tree producers in hurricane-affected counties; (5) assistance to dairy producers for production and spoilage losses in hurricane-affected counties; (6) assistance to producers and first handlers of cottonseed; (7) emergency watershed protection and emergency conservation program activities; and (8) assistance for additional conservation-related technical assistance in each state that has a disaster or hurricane-affected county.
