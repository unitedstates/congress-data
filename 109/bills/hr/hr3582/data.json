Directs the Attorney General to use such withheld amounts and authorized funds under this Act for additional grants to states in compliance to computerize, improve, transmit, and index their own data and criminal history files in the national data and criminal history systems for child sexual abuse protection and sentencing reform. Requires a state, to be eligible for funding under this Act, to: (1) study its laws pertaining to intrafamilial and extrafamilial sexual abuse of children, and examine issues concerning their differences; (2) examine disparities in charging and sentencing perpetrators of child sexual abuse; (3) examine, and implement, legislative actions necessary to equalize charging and sentencing without regard to familial relationship of perpetrator to child victim; (4) compile, analyze, and report relevant data; and (5) promote regulations requiring its courts and agencies to compile such data."
