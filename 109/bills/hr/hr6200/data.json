Requires the ballots cast at a precinct or equivalent location to be counted by hand by election officials at the precinct. Allows a representative of each political party with a candidate on the ballot, as well as any interested member of the public, to observe the officials as they count the ballots. Amends federal law to move observation of Washington's Birthday to Election Day during presidential election years."
