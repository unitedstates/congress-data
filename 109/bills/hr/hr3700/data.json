    "text": "Reducing Immigration to a Genuinely Healthy Total (RIGHT) Act of 2005 - Reduces U.S. immigration levels (and visa allotments) for: (1) family-sponsored immigrants to zero; (2) diversity immigrants to zero; and (3) employment-based immigrants. Caps fiscal year humanitarian-related entries at 50,000, which shall include: (1) refugees; (2) assylees; (3) Polish, Hungarian, Soviet, and Indochinese parolees; (4) aliens whose removal is canceled and status adjusted; and (5) aliens provided permanent resident status through private legislation. Eliminates specified legalization and amnesty programs, including: (1) agricultural worker amnesty; (2) Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) legalizations; (3) amnesties under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997, and the Haitian Refugee and Immigration Fairness Act of 1998; and (4) Cuban-Haitian adjustments. Requires congressional approval for extension of designation of foreign states for temporary protected status designations. Establishes as nonimmigrant classifications: (1) spouses and minor children of lawful permanent residents (currently, a preference immigrant classification); and (2) parents of U.S. adult citizens (currently, an immediate relative classification exempt from numerical immigrant limitations). Prohibits automatic citizenship by birth unless at least one of the individual's parents is, at the time of birth, a U.S. citizen or national or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Makes voting in a foreign election a basis for automatic loss of U.S. citizenship. Sets forth the instances under which illegal U.S. presence by a person shall be considered as not demonstrating good moral character for immigration purposes."
