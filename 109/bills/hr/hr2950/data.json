Repeals, after 2005: (1) the overall limitation on itemized tax deductions; (2) the phaseout of personal tax exemptions; and (3) the alternative minimum tax on individuals. Imposes an additional income tax on adjusted gross incomes exceeding certain threshold levels to ensure the revenue neutrality of this Act."
