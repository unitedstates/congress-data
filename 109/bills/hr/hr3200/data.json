Reinstates Federal provisions concerning such coverage as in effect prior to the enactment of the above Act. Reinstates the PL 109-13 SGLI $400,000 maximum member coverage amount.Requires the Secretary of the military department concerned to notify a member's spouse when a member who is married and is: (1) eligible for SGLI elects not to be so insured; (2) insured and whose spouse is designated as a beneficiary if the member elects coverage in an amount less than the maximum; or (3) insured makes a beneficiary designation of a person other than the member's spouse or child.
