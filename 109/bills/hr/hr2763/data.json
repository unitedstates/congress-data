Defines a healthy food or beverage: (1) as one that derives 30 percent or less of its total calories from fat, 10 percent or less of its total calories from saturated fat and trans fat, and 35 percent or less of its total calories from sugars (excluding those sugars occurring naturally in fruits, vegetables, and dairy products); and (2) to include nuts, seeds, and flavored fluid milk. Requires a grantee to: (1) remove any vending machines that sell foods and beverages of minimal nutritional value from each elementary or secondary school in which qualified vending machines will be placed; and (2) use only qualified vending machines in such schools for a prescribed period."
