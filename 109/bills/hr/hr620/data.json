Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study of the potential adverse consequences of preventing aliens unlawfully present in the United States from obtaining driver's licenses. Requires the Comptroller General to report findings of both studies to appropriate congressional committees and to the Secretary of Homeland Security, incorporating any recommendations for administrative or legislative action."
