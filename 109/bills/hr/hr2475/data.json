(Sec. 102) Specifies that the amounts authorized and the authorized personnel ceilings as of September 30, 2006, for such activities are those specified in the classified Schedule of Authorizations, which shall be made available to the Senate and House Appropriations Committees and the President. (Sec. 103) Allows the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), with the approval of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, to authorize employment of civilian personnel in excess of the number authorized for FY 2006 when necessary for the performance of important intelligence functions. Requires notification of the congressional intelligence committees on the use of such authority. (Sec. 104) Authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence Community Management Account for FY2006, for full-time personnel for elements within such Account, and for certain classified personnel. Title II: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System - (Sec. 201) Authorizes appropriations for FY2006 for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund. Title III: General Provisions - (Sec. 301) Permits appropriations authorized by this Act for salary, pay, retirement, and other benefits for federal employees to be increased by such additional or supplemental amounts as may be necessary for increases in such compensation or benefits authorized by law. (Sec. 302) Specifies that the authorization of appropriations by this Act shall not be deemed to constitute authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity which is not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of the United States. (Sec. 304) Requires the DNI's: (1) Science and Technology Committee to prioritize research and development related to intelligence; and (2) Director of Science and Technology to assist the DNI in establishing intelligence community (IC) technology goals.

(Sec. 305) Requires the DNI to submit to the intelligence committees a classified comprehensive inventory of all special access programs under the National Intelligence Program. (Sec. 306) Expresses the sense of Congress that the DNI should expeditiously establish the necessary processes and procedures with the heads of executive departments and agencies to carry out the budgetary execution authorities within the National Security Intelligence Reform Act of 2004. (Sec. 307) Expresses the sense of Congress that the DNI should promptly establish and oversee implementation of a multi-level security clearance system across the IC to leverage the cultural and linguistic skills of subject matter experts and individuals proficient in foreign languages critical to national security. (Sec. 308) Requires the DNI to provide written notice to Congress explaining the failure of the executive branch to implement within the appropriate deadlines the National Counterterrorism Center, as required under the National Security Intelligence Reform Act of 2004, including the failure by the President to nominate an individual to serve as its Director. Requires monthly updates of such notice until the Center is fully implemented and operational."
