    "text": "Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act - Requires: (1) all states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and possessions, and Indian tribes (jurisdictions) to maintain a sex offender registry; and (2) sex offenders to register and maintain a current registration in each jurisdiction where the offender resides, was convicted, and is an employee or student. Sets forth requirements for sex offender registries, including required information, duration of registration, and in person verification of sex offender identity. Establishes: (1) the Jessica Lunsford Address Verification Program; (2) the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website; and (3) the Megan Nicole Kanka and Alexandra Nicole Zapp Community Notification Program. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) maintain a database at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to be known as the National Sex Offender Registry; (2) establish and implement a Sex Offender Management Assistance program; (3) carry out a demonstration project for using electronic monitoring devices; and (4) ensure that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and other child protection agencies have access to national crime information databases. Amends the federal criminal code to: (1) require the Bureau of Prisons to establish non-residential sex offender management and treatment programs; (2) impose penalties on sex offenders for failure to register; (3) prohibit the use of a controlled substance to facilitate a sex offense; and (4) prohibit the use of the Internet to distribute a date rape drug. Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize grants to assist states in enforcing sex offender registration requirements. Establishes within the Department of Justice an Office on Sexual Violence and Crimes against Children."
