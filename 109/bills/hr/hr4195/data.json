Provides that: (1) nothing in this Act modifies any contractual rights between the two districts and the United States or any rights, obligations, or relationships between the districts and their landowners as governed by Oregon law; and (2) upon discharge in full of the repayment obligation, the lands at issue shall not be subject to ownership and full-cost pricing limitations under reclamation and irrigation provisions. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, upon request, to provide certification of the landholder's freedom from such limitations."
