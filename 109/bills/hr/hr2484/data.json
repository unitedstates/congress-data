    "text": "Americans in Uniform Act of 2005 - Requires the Department of Defense (DOD), in awarding any contract for the procurement of goods and services, to use as an evaluation factor whether entities intend to carry out the contract using employees or individual subcontractors who are members of the Selected Reserve. Requires entities claiming the intention to use such employees or subcontractors to document to DOD the number that the entity will employ, or contract with, for the contract in question. Authorizes the Secretary of the military department concerned to waive such requirement for national security purposes. Increases by specified amounts the following special pays and allowances for reserve personnel: (1) hardship duty pay; (2) reenlistment bonuses; and (3) the family separation allowance. Makes eligible for burial in Arlington National Cemetery: (1) a member or former member of the reserves who was under age 60 at the time of death and who, but for such age, would have been eligible for military retired pay; and (2) his or her dependents. Makes eligible for space-available travel on DOD aircraft: (1) a member or former member of the reserves under 60 years of age who, but for such age, would be eligible for military retired pay; and (2) his or her spouse. Requires a report from the Comptroller General to Congress on difficulties faced by members of the National Guard and reserves with respect to employment as a result of being ordered to full-time National Guard duty or active-duty service, respectively."
