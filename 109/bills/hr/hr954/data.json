    "text": "Rural Transportation Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish and implement a rural road safety program under which funds shall be apportioned to each State to: (1) improve horizontal and vertical alignment, signage and pavement markings, and sight distances; (2) eliminate wheel lane rutting, increase skid resistance, and smooth roadways; (3) widen lanes and shoulders; (4) install dedicated turn lanes and traffic and safety lights; and (5) install and upgrade guardrails, traffic barriers, crash cushions, protective devices, and rumblestrips. Requires States to: (1) conduct and maintain an engineering survey of all two-lane rural roads classified as minor and major collectors and minor arterials to identify dangerous locations and to assign priorities and establish a schedule for improvements; and (2) establish a process to analyze and assess results achieved. Increases certain apportionments for: (1) Federal highway aid to rural areas for roads functionally classified as minor arterials and major and minor collectors; (2) highway bridge replacement and rehabilitation; and (3) State planning and research programs. Authorizes appropriations from the Highway Trust Fund for the Appalachian development highway system program."
