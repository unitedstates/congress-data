Requires the Secretary of Defense to pay, on behalf of any member who died after September 11, 2001, as a result of a wound, injury, or illness sustained while serving or traveling to or from a mission in Iraq or Afghanistan, and who was not insured under SGLI at the $250,000 level, the difference between $250,000 and the amount of any SGLI already paid."
