Authorizes the President to waive such provision if in the U.S. national interest. Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should propose amendments to such Conventions to ensure that persons who enjoy immunity from criminal jurisdiction (under such Conventions) do not receive such immunity with respect to acts of disbursing radioactive or other substances posing a lasting, clear and present danger to public health."
