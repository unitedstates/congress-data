Defines \"Caribbean\" to include Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Increases the federal share of costs for projects funded under that Act. Prescribes the form of payment for such projects undertaken in the United States and Canada versus Latin America and the Caribbean. Encourages the Secretary of the Interior to convene an advisory group to assist in carrying out NMBCA. Establishes the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. Increases the amount of funds that the Secretary may expend to administer the NMBCA. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer to the Fund amounts that were in the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Account immediately before the enactment of this Act. Authorizes appropriations for FY2006-FY2010. Requires at least 75% of such appropriations to be used for projects outside the United States."
