    "text": "Prevention and Deterrence of Crimes Against Children Act of 2005 - Rewrites provisions of the federal criminal code regarding penalties for crimes against children to require a person convicted of a federal crime of violence against an individual under age 18 to be sentenced to: (1) death or life imprisonment if the crime results in the death of a person under age 18; (2) life or at least 30 years imprisonment if the crime is a kidnaping, sexual assault, or maiming, or results in serious bodily injury; (3) life or at least 20 years imprisonment if the crime results in bodily injury; (4) life or at least 15 years imprisonment if a dangerous weapon was used during and in relation to the crime; and (5) life or at least ten years imprisonment in any other case. Denies a court, justice, or judge jurisdiction to consider claims relating to the judgment or sentence in an application for writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court for a crime that involved the killing of a person under age 18. Sets timetables for proceedings. Extends certain rights associated with habeas corpus proceedings to victims of the State offense at issue. Makes this Act applicable to pending cases."
