Directs the Council, in carrying out the demonstration project, to ensure that specified requirements are met with respect to: (1) communications; (2) training relating to duties and responsibilities during an emergency situation; (3) access to technologies, information, or other assistance; (4) coordination with the earliest governmentwide continuity of operations interagency exercise; (5) plans detailing which operations will be performed, which employees will perform those operations, and how those operations are to be performed; (6) participation (limited to those employees who would otherwise have been eligible to telework); and (7) coordination with otherwise existing federal telework policies, requirements, and funding."
