    "text": "Private Security Officer Employment Enhancement Act of 2006 - Amends the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security, upon request by a covered employer (certain non-governmental companies that provide security guard services or that have more than 50 employees of which at least three are internal security employees), to provide for a National Crime Information Center (NCIC) criminal history records check on a current or prospective employee. Requires such request to include fingerprints. Prohibits such an employer from employing such an employee to provide any security service unless: (1) the employer first obtains the results of an NCIC criminal history records check; and (2) neither the results of that check nor any other information made available to the employer indicate that the employee has any unpardoned convictions under federal or state law of any felony or specified offenses. Prohibits such an employer from making such a request without the employee's consent. Requires an employer to ensure that information received is maintained confidentially, not misused, and destroyed within a specified time. Directs the Secretary to establish procedures to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security properly uses the results. Provides criminal penalties for knowingly and intentionally using any information obtained for a purpose other than determining suitability for employment."
