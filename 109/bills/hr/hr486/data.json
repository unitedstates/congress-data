Includes in such land exchange the conveyance of all surface, subsurface, mineral, and water rights. Requires the Secretary to carry out the land exchange in accordance with the Federal Land Policy Management Act of 1976. Authorizes a cash equalization payment in excess of 25% of the appraised value of the federal land. Prohibits such exchange of federal and non-federal land from requiring an amendment to the White Sands Resource Management Plan.
