    "text": "Chemical Facility Security Act of 2005 - Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to designate certain combinations of chemical sources and substances of concern as high-priority categories based on the severity of the threat of a terrorist release, taking into account specified factors. Requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations requiring owners or operators of chemical sources to conduct vulnerability assessments and develop and implement site security plans that address the results. Directs chemical sources not in high-priority categories to certify completion of such assessments and implementation of such plans. Requires the Secretary, in promulgating regulations and establishing procedures, protocols, and standards for such assessments and plans, to consider specified factors, including the likelihood that a chemical source will be the target of terrorism and the potential scope of injury. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) designate or exempt certain categories of stationary sources as chemical sources; and (2) designate, exempt, and adjust threshold quantities of substances of concern. Establishes a five-year assessment and plan review requirement for chemical sources not in high-priority categories. Requires high-priority chemical sources to provide the Secretary with any changes to assessments and plans within 90 days. Sets forth disclosure protections and requires the development of confidentiality protocols for information obtained under this Act. Establishes penalties for unauthorized disclosures. Establishes enforcement mechanisms for noncompliance with assessment or plan requirements. Sets forth recordkeeping and site inspection requirements. Exempts from this Act chemical sources required to prepare assessments and plans under specified Federal laws. Authorizes civil and administrative penalties."
