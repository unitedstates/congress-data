Requires Resolution Copper the grantee or grantees, in consultation with the town, the Secretary, interested Apache Indian tribes, and other interested parties, to determine whether the area covered by the easement should be managed to establish additional cultural and historic resource protections or measures. Directs: (1) the Secretary, in consultation with Resolution Copper, the town, and other interested parties, to construct in the Global Ranger District of the Tonto National Forest one or more replacement campgrounds for the Oak Flat Campground; and (2) the Secretary of the Interior to immediately convey to the Arizona State Parks Board approximately 2,000 acres of land under such Secretary's jurisdiction within the exterior boundary of the proposed Tam O'Shanter Area State Park for the establishment of such Park. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, immediately upon request by the Board, to grant the Board a right-of-way for a State Park access road across any federal lands on the Tam O' Shanter Access Road in order to provide public access to the proposed State Park."
