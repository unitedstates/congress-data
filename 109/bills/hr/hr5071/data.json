    "text": "Animas River Good Samaritan Mined Land Remediation Pilot Project Act - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a 10-year pilot project under which the Administrator, with the State of Colorado's concurrence, may issue or modify, enforce, or terminate a permit to a remediating party for discharges associated with remediation activity at an abandoned or inactive mined land in the Animas River watershed above Elk Creek in San Juan County, Colorado, that modifies otherwise applicable discharge requirements, effluent limitations, and permit certification requirements. Defines a \"remediating party\" as: (1) the United States, except with respect to abandoned or inactive mined land on federal land; (2) the State of Colorado or its political subdivisions; or (3) persons that are neither responsible for site activities that contributed to pollution discharges nor owners of the site. Sets forth procedural guidelines for a applying for, reviewing, issuing, enforcing, and terminating such permits for remediation activities at an abandoned or inactive mined land from which there is, or may be, a discharge of pollutants into U.S. waters. Requires: (1) an applicant to submit a remediation plan describing pollutants present, persons responsible, remediation goals, practices to meet maximum daily load allocations, the monitoring method, and the remediation schedule and budget; and (2) the Administrator to issue regulations establishing generally applicable requirements for such plans."
