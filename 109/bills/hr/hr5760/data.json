Directs the Secretary to: (1) designate the Kings River Demonstration Project in the Sierra National Forest as the \"Kings River Research Project\" as a means to address disputes over fuels reduction projects and the benefits and impacts related to wildlife, watershed, and other resources; (2) provide, under the Project, for research about the potential positive and negative impacts of fuel reduction and forest health treatments on the Pacific fisher, California spotted owl, and the Kings River watershed; and (3) complete the final environmental impact statement and issue the record of decision for the Project by not later than October 31, 2006. Deems the final environmental impact statement and record of decision, along with all actions implementing the Project, to be in compliance with specified environmental laws, so long as any timber removed under the Project is removed using uneven-aged silvicultural treatments."
