Directs the FTC to promulgate regulations restricting the sale and purchase of such numbers and any unfair or deceptive acts or practices involved in such a sale or purchase. Requires such regulations to be no broader than necessary to: (1) provide reasonable assurance that Social Security numbers will not be used to commit or facilitate fraud, deception, or crime; and (2) prevent an undue risk of bodily, emotional, or financial harm to individuals. Requires such regulations also to include exceptions which permit the sale and purchase of Social Security numbers to the extent necessary for: (1) law enforcement, national security, and public health purposes; (2) research conducted for the purpose of advancing public knowledge, subject to certain conditions; and (3) legitimate consumer credit verification, if the numbers used are redacted in accordance with uniform redaction standards established by the FTC in such regulations. Requires exceptions also for the sale and purchase of such numbers to the extent: (1) necessary in emergency situations to protect the health or safety of one or more individuals; and (2) consistent with an individual's voluntary and affirmative written consent to the sale or purchase of his or her number. Prescribes enforcement requirements. Authorizes states to bring civil actions on behalf of state residents in a U.S. district court to: (1) enjoin an act or practice; (2) enforce compliance with the regulation; (3) obtain civil penalties in an amount of $11,000 per violation, up to a total of $5 million; or (4) obtain other appropriate legal and equitable relief. Allows the U.S. Attorney General to institute a criminal proceeding for a violation of this Act."
