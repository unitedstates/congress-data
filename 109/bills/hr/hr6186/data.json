Sets forth conditions to be a qualifying state, including that the state: (1) has a population increase of more than 50% between 1995 and 2005; (2) is projected to have fewer than 555 nurses per 100,000 residents by 2020; and (3) has a program in place, as of January 1, 2006, to assist in increasing the number of faculty at such schools of nursing. Allows such a grant to be used for collegiate school of nursing salaries, benefits, training, and related expenses. Prohibits such a grant from being expended for any capital expenses."
