Replaces the $4,800 in earnings limit that such an individual can earn while continuing to receive such an annuity with an annual earning limitation computed by totaling the monthly allowable earning for each month of the year. Sets forth a calculation for determining payment of the annuity if the annual earning exceeds the annual allowable earning. Sets the monthly allowable earning at $700 and for years after 2007 as the larger of the amount for the previous year or the amount calculated using a formula based on the national average wage index."
