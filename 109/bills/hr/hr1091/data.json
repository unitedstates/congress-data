Allows a credit against alternative minimum tax liability for the work opportunity tax credit, the welfare to work tax credit, and the tax credit for increasing research activities. Provides for a minimum standard tax deduction of $2,500 for expenses for the business use of a home. Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to: (1) exempt from minimum wage requirements employers with less than ten employees; (2) increase the minimum wage to $5.50 beginning October 1, 2006, $6.00 beginning October 1, 2007, and $6.50 beginning October 1, 2008; and (3) phase in an increase in the gross volume of sales amount applicable to the small business exemption from minimum wage requirements. Amends title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Social Security Act to exclude from income determinations under the supplemental security income programs minimum wage income that exceeds certain earned income."
