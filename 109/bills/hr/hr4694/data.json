Permits additional expenditures by eligible major party, third party, and independent candidates. Establishes in the Treasury the Grassroots Good Citizenship Fund (Fund), which shall provide public funding for House candidates' expenditures. Authorizes certain additional amounts from state and national party committees. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) authorize taxpayers to designate specified overpayments and contributions for the Fund; and (2) increase corporate tax rates on taxable income above $10 million, and require payment of the amounts received by reason of such increase to the Fund. Amends FECA to: (1) ban independent expenditures in House elections; (2) ban the use of nonfederal funds for certain disbursements; and (3) set forth specified House limitations for expenditures for elections other than general elections."
