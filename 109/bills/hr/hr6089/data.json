    "text": "Illegal Immigrant Deterrence and Public Safety Act of 2006 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to permit indefinite detention of specified dangerous aliens under orders of removal who cannot be removed, subject to review every six months. States that habeas corpus review of such provisions shall be available only in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia after exhaustion of administrative remedies. Requires that a detention review process be established for aliens under order of removal who have effected an entry and are cooperating with removal. Authorizes indefinite detention of an inadmissible alien until such alien is subject to an administrative final order of removal. States that habeas corpus review of such provision shall be available only in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia after exhaustion of administrative remedies. Provides that: (1) states and state and local law enforcement personnel have the inherent authority to investigate, identify, apprehend, arrest, detain, or transfer to federal custody aliens in the United States (including interstate transportation to detention centers) for the purposes of assisting in U.S. immigration enforcement in the course of carrying out routine duties; and (2) nothing in this section may be construed to require state or local law enforcement personnel to report the identity of a victim of, or a witness to, a criminal offense for immigration enforcement purposes, or to arrest such victim or witness for an immigration law violation."
