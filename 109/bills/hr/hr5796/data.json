Sets forth a formula for calculating such excluded reimbursable cost. Provides that as long as an entity that is allocated and that pays capital, interest, and operation and maintenance costs associated with an amount of Project water historically assigned to the Canal does not use the Canal for the conveyance of Project water, that entity shall be entitled to convey an equivalent amount of non-Project water through the Canal without additional cost."
