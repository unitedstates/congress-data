    "text": "Children's Safety Act of 2005 - Title I: Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act - Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act - Subtitle A: Jacob Wetterling Sex Offender Registration and Notification Program - (Sec. 111) Includes within the definition of a \"sex offender\" for purposes of this title an individual convicted of, or adjudicated a juvenile delinquent for, a serious sex offense or a specified offense (including a misdemeanor sex offense) against a minor. (Sec. 112) Requires each state, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and each federally recognized Indian tribe to maintain a sex offender registry. (Sec. 113) Requires a sex offender to register, and keep the registration current, in each jurisdiction where the offender resides, is an employee, and is a student. Directs the offender to initially register: (1) before completing a sentence of imprisonment with respect to the offense giving rise to the registration requirement; or (2) not later than five days after being sentenced for that offense, if the offender is not sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Requires: (1) the offender to inform each jurisdiction involved within five days after each change of residence, employment, or student status; (2) the Attorney General to prescribe a method for the registration of sex offenders convicted before this Act's enactment or its effective date in a particular jurisdiction; and (3) each jurisdiction other than a federally recognized Indian tribe to provide a criminal penalty, including a maximum term of imprisonment that is greater than one year and a minimum term that is no less than 90 days, for the failure of an offender to comply with this title's requirements. (Sec. 114) Lists information that the offender must provide for inclusion in the registry, including name and aliases, Social Security number, residence, place of employment, place where the offender is a student, license plate number, photograph, fingerprints and palm prints, and DNA sample. Requires the jurisdiction to include a statement of the facts of the offense giving rise to the registration requirement, including whether the offender was prosecuted as a juvenile and the offender's criminal history. (Sec. 115) Requires an offender to keep the registration current: (1) for the life of the offender if the offense is a specified offense against a minor, a serious sex offense, or a second misdemeanor sex offense against a minor; and (2) for a 20-year period (excluding any time the offender is in custody or civilly committed) in any other case. (Sec. 116) Requires an offender to appear in person and verify the information in each registry at least every six months. (Sec. 117) Requires the appropriate official, shortly before release from custody of the offender (or if the offender is not in custody, immediately after sentencing), to: (1) inform and explain to the offender the duty to register; (2) require the offender to sign a form stating that the offender understands the registration requirement; and (3) ensure that the offender is registered. (Sec. 118) Establishes the Jessica Lunsford Address Verification program, under which an appropriate official shall verify the residence of each registered offender at least monthly (or in the case of an offender required to register because of a misdemeanor sex offense against a minor, at least quarterly). Allows such verification to be achieved by mailing a nonforwardable verification form to the offender's last known address, which the offender must return within a set period. (Sec. 119) Directs the Attorney General to maintain a national database (known as the National Sex Offender Registry) at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for each offender and for each other person required to register in a jurisdiction's registry. (Sec. 120) Establishes the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public website. Requires the Attorney General to: (1) maintain the website as a site on the Internet which allows the public to obtain relevant information for each offender by a single query; and (2) ensure that updated information about an offender is immediately transmitted by electronic forwarding to all relevant jurisdictions. (Sec. 121) Requires each jurisdiction to make available and readily accessible on the Internet all information about each offender in the registry, except for the offender's Social Security number, the victim's identity, and any other information exempted by the Attorney General. Makes an exception for information about an offender required to register for committing a misdemeanor sex offense against a minor who has attained age 16. (Sec. 122) Establishes the Megan Nicole Kanka and Alexandra Nicole Zapp Community Program, under which an appropriate jurisdiction official, within five days after an offender registers or updates a registration, shall provide information about that offender to: (1) the Attorney General for inclusion in the National Sex Offender Registry; (2) appropriate law enforcement agencies and each school and public housing agency in each area in which the individual resides, is employed, or is a student; (3) each jurisdiction from or to which a change of residence, work, or student status occurs; (4) any agency responsible for conducting employment-related background checks under the National Child Protection Act of 1993; (5) social service entities responsible for protecting minors in the child welfare system; and (6) volunteer organizations in which contact with minors or other vulnerable individuals might occur.
