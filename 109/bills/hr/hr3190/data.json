    "text": "Vietnam Human Rights Act of 2005 - Prohibits U.S. nonhumanitarian assistance to the government of Vietnam (except for any program assisted in FY2005) unless the President certifies to Congress that: (1) the government of Vietnam has made substantial progress toward releasing all political and religious prisoners from imprisonment, including respecting freedom of religion and the human rights of members of ethnic minority groups in the Central Highlands or elsewhere in Vietnam; and (2) neither any official of the government of Vietnam nor any entity owned by such government was complicit in a severe form of trafficking in persons (or the government of Vietnam took appropriate steps to end such complicity). Authorizes the President to waive such requirements if increased U.S. nonhumanitarian assistance would promote the purposes of this Act or is otherwise in the U.S. national interest. Authorizes the President to provide U.S. assistance, through appropriate nongovernmental organizations, for the support of individuals and organizations to promote human rights and nonviolent democratic change in Vietnam. Declares it is U.S. policy: (1) to take such measures as are necessary to overcome the jamming of Radio Free Asia by the government of Vietnam; and (2) that educational and cultural exchange programs with Vietnam should promote progress toward freedom and democracy. Declares it is U.S. policy to offer refugee resettlement to Vietnam nationals (including members of the Montagnard ethnic minority groups) who are eligible for the Orderly Departure Program, (ODP), Resettlement Opportunities for Vietnamese Returnees (ROVR), the Amerasian Homecoming Act of 1988, or any other U.S. refugee program, but who were deemed ineligible for reasons of administrative error or certain circumstances beyond their control. Directs the Secretary of State to report annually on progress toward democracy in Vietnam."
