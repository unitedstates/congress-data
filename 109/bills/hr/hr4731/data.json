    "text": "Eliminate Warehousing of Consumer Internet Data Act of 2006 - Requires an owner of an Internet website to destroy, within a reasonable time frame, any data containing personal information if the information: (1) is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected or any other legitimate business purpose; or (2) there are no pending requests or orders for access to such information pursuant to a court order. Treats a violation of this Act as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or deceptive act or practice prescribed under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce this Act in the same manner, by the same means, and with the same jurisdiction as though all applicable terms and provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act were incorporated into and made part of this Act."
