Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to issue regulations as necessary to repeal such provisions, including removing any applicable prohibition on transactions or payments. Authorizes U.S. courts to recognize, enforce, or otherwise validate an assertion of rights in any mark or trade name based on common law rights or registration or under any applicable provision of law or any applicable treaty to which the United States is a party. Requires the United States Trade Representative to examine policies and practices of Cuba with respect to protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights."
