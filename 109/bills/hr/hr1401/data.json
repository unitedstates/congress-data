    "text": "Colorectal Cancer Mortality Prevention Act of 2005 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to provide matching grants to States to carry out programs to: (1) screen for colorectal cancer as a preventive health measure; (2) provide referrals for medical treatment to individuals screened and ensure appropriate follow-up services; (3) develop and disseminate information and education programs for the detection and control of colorectal cancer; (4) improve the education, training, and skills of health professions in the detection and control of colorectal cancer; (5) establish mechanisms to monitor the quality of screening procedures for colorectal cancer; and (6) evaluate such activities through surveillance or program-monitoring. Requires States to meet specified matching fund requirements and other criteria to receive a grant, including ensuring that 60 percent of grant money is spent on screening and medical treatment, assuring the quality of screening procedures, giving priority to low-income individuals, and limiting the fees charged. Allows the Secretary to provide training, technical assistance, supplies, equipment, and services to aid the State in carrying out such a program. Requires the Secretary to: (1) issue guidelines for assuring the quality of any colorectal screening procedures carried out under this Act; and (2) evaluate the programs annually."
