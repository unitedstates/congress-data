    "text": "Office of National Drug Control Reauthorization Act - Amends the Official of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 to repeal provisions providing for termination of the Office. Clean Sports Act of 2005 - Prohibits a major professional league from arranging, promoting, organizing, or producing a professional game without meeting the requirements established by this Act for testing for the use of prohibited substances by professional athletes and for public disclosure of the names of athletes who test positive. Requires a suspension of an athlete for a minimum of two years for the first violation and a lifetime ban for the second violation. Allows a league to impose a lesser penalty if the athlete: (1) establishes that he did not know or suspect, and could not reasonably have known or suspected even with the exercise of utmost caution, that he had used the prohibited substance; or (2) provides substantial assistance to the league in identifying violations of the league's drug testing policy by other athletes or by any personnel working with or treating athletes. Authorizes the Director of National Control Policy to modify standards for a league under exceptional circumstances or for good cause with limitations. Require the Director to include additional professional sporting leagues or colleges if such additions would prevent the use of such substances by high school, college, or professional athletes. Treats violations of this Act as unfair or deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study the use of performance-enhancing substances by college athletes. Requires the Director to establish a commission on high school and college athletics."
