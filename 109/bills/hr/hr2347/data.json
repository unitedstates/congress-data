Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to: (1) designate SCORE project areas from among local government entity-designated areas; (2) make SCORE project area planning and revitalization grants. Requires a local government grantee to establish a SCORE Reinvestment Fund. Sets forth provisions respecting housing units, businesses, and economic development projects in SCORE project areas that are receiving community development block grant funds. Amends the Code to: (1) include SCORE project areas within the work opportunity tax credit; and (2) permit an additional first-year depreciation amount for certain SCORE project area residential real property or residential rental property."
