Prohibits such care or services with respect to a disability found to have resulted from a cause other than such duty. Terminates eligibility two years after the member's discharge or release from such duty. Directs the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to review and make recommendations for the health surveillance of members who may be exposed to environmental hazards as the result of duty in areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to maintain a database of members provided health care by the Department of Veterans Affairs pursuant to such duty."
