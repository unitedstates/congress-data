    "text": "Hurricanes Katrina and Rita Environmental Justice Act - Defines \"environmental justice\" to mean the fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and socioeconomic groups with respect to the development and implementation of laws affecting the environment. Requires the heads of federal agencies to make achieving environmental justice part of their missions by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and adverse effects of its programs on minority, low-income populations in the area affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Requires agencies to conduct programs in a manner to prevent discrimination. Establishes the Hurricanes Katrina and Rita Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice. Includes among the functions of the working group providing guidance to federal and state agencies on criteria for identifying effects on such populations. Requires federal agencies to develop agency-wide environmental justice strategies that address disproportionately high and adverse effects or disproportionately low benefits of their programs with respect to minority, low-income populations. Requires such strategies to identify programs that should be revised to: (1) promote enforcement of all health and environmental statutes in areas with such populations; (2) ensure greater public participation; (3) improve research and data collection; and (4) identify differential patterns of use of natural resources among such populations. Establishes the Federal Hurricanes Katrina and Rita Environmental Justice Advisory Committee to provide independent advice and recommendations to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Working Group on areas relating to environmental justice."
