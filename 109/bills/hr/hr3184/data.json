Prohibits certain defense and dual use assistance to a country that has signed a Small Quantities Protocol but does not satisfy such implementation and inspection requirements. Authorizes the President to waive such prohibitions for up to one fiscal year for reasons of national security. Directs the President to require the U.S. Permanent Representative to the IAEA to use U.S. influence to change IAEA policy regarding the Small Quantities Protocol in order to: (1) eliminate the Small Quantities Protocol; (2) require that any IAEA member state that has signed a Small Quantities Protocol sign and implement the Additional Protocol, and provide IAEA inspectors with access to its nuclear-related facilities; and (3) require that any IAEA member state that does not comply with such implementation and inspection requirements be ineligible to receive nuclear material, technology, equipment, or assistance from any IAEA member state, and be subject to penalties as provided for by this Act."
