Authorizes the Secretary to limit access to such refuges to specified time periods but requires access to each refuge during at least one period each year. Directs the Secretary, in issuing special use permits under this Act, to give priority to permit applications that do not negatively impact opportunities for wildlife-dependent recreation. Authorizes the Secretary to include in any permit issued under this Act conditions that the Secretary determines are necessary to protect fish and wildlife populations or habitat or public health and safety."
