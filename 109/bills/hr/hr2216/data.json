Requires an annual report from the Office to Congress on the status of state-sponsored and state-directed Internet jamming by repressive foreign governments and a description of U.S. efforts to counter such jamming. Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should: (1) denounce repressive foreign governments that engage in Internet jamming; (2) direct the U.S. Representative to the United Nations (UN) to submit a resolution condemning repressive foreign governments that engage in Internet jamming and deny their citizens the freedom to access and share information on the Internet; and (3) deploy technologies aimed at defeating state-sponsored and state-directed Internet jamming by repressive foreign governments, and the intimidation and persecution by such governments of their citizens who use the Internet."
