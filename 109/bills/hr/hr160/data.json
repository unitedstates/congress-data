Authorizes the State also to require the individual's resources not to exceed whatever level the State may establish, so long as it is not more restrictive than the requirements of SSA title XVI (Supplemental Security Income). Provides for the application to such new group of the enhanced Federal medical assistance percentage dtermined under SSA title XXI (State Children's Health Insurance Program) (SCHIP). Amends SSA title XI to provide for an increase in the Medicaid payment limit for territories to accommodate expanded coverage for residents of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands."
