Amends rule XXII (House and Senate Relations) of the Rules of the House of Representatives to prohibit consideration of a bill or amendment between the chambers or conference report on such bill unless a list of all earmarks in it, an identification of the Member who proposed it (if possible), and an explanation of the essential governmental purpose for the earmark are available to all Members, and made available to the general public on the Internet for at least 72 hours before its consideration."
