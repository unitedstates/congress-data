Specifies the Secretary's duties through such Initiative, including: (1) coordinating with the principal official of each state, local, tribal, or regional information fusion center and the official designated as the Homeland Security Advisor of the State; (2) providing Department of Homeland Security (DHS) operational and intelligence advice and assistance to such centers; (3) reviewing homeland security information gathered by such centers and incorporate relevant information with Department information; and (4) providing training to such centers and encourage them to participate in terrorist threat-related exercises conducted by the Department. Requires the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees with a concept of operations for the Initiative, including a privacy and civil liberties impact assessment. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis, to establish a Homeland Security Information Sharing Fellows Program."
