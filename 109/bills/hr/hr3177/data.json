    "text": "Lobby Gift Ban Act of 2005 - Prohibits a registered lobbyist from knowingly making a gift to a Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, officer, or employee of Congress, with the exception of certain: (1) lawful political fundraising activities; (2) gifts from relatives; (3) employee benefits; (4) informational materials; (5) items of nominal value; (6) gifts on a personal basis, under specified circumstances; (7) outside business or employment activities provided to his or her spouse; (8) opportunities and benefits unrelated to congressional employment; and (9) foods or refreshments of nominal value offered other than as part of a meal. Considers a gift to a family member of a Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, officer, or employee of Congress, or a gift to any other individual based on that individual's relationship with the Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, officer, or employee, to be a prohibited gift if it was given because of the individual's official position. Imposes a civil fine of $50,000 for violation of this Act, depending on the extent and gravity of the violation. Amends the Rules of the House of Representatives to prohibit a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner from accepting a gift from a registered lobbyist prohibited by this Act."
