Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to furnish outpatient health care at the Manila Outpatient Clinic in the Republic of the Philippines for such veterans residing in the Philippines. Makes spouses of such veterans eligible for veterans' educational assistance. Makes the rate of assistance for such spouses and children residing in the United States equal to the rate for the dependents of U.S. veterans. Makes such spouses and dependents eligible for job counseling, training, and placement benefits. Requires the Secretary to ensure that at least one member of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans is a Commonwealth Army veteran or new Philippine Scout."
