    "text": "United States-Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Human Dignity Act - Prohibits the affixation of the \"Made in the USA\" label to a product (including a textile fiber product) leaving the Northern Mariana Islands for shipment to any place in the United States or abroad unless: (1) each worker producing such product was paid a minimum wage equal to or greater than the wage set by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938; (2) the product was manufactured in compliance with all federal laws relating to labor rights and working conditions; and (3) the factory or other business producing the product does not employ individuals under conditions of indentured servitude. Applies to the Northern Mariana Islands: (1) the minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938; and (2) the Immigration and Nationality Act. Prohibits any product of the Northern Mariana Islands from entering U.S. customs territory duty-free or quota-free as a product of an insular possession, unless specified requirements relating to fair labor practices and country of origin are met. Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to authorize inspection by the Customs Service of any vessel from a foreign port or from a place in any U.S. territory or possession arriving at a port or place in the Northern Mariana Islands. Prohibits the use of federal assistance for public buildings or public works projects in the Northern Mariana Islands which involve the employment of mechanics or laborers unless the project is subject to a contract containing specified provisions on the rate of wages for such laborers and mechanics. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to develop technical assistance programs for economic diversification, job creation, and job training in the Northern Mariana Islands. Requires studies of: (1) the extent of human and labor rights violations in the Northern Mariana Islands; and (2) security and immigration vulnerabilities there."
