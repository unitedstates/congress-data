    "text": "National Invasive Species Council Act - Declares that no Federal agency may authorize, fund, or carry out any action that would likely cause or promote the introduction or spread of an invasive species in the United States or any other location, unless the agency head determines that: (1) the benefits outweigh the potential harm to the environment, economy, or human health; and (2) all feasible and prudent measures to minimize the risk or harm will be taken. Requires the Council for Environmental Quality, in conjunction with the National Invasive Species Council, to develop guidelines for such measures. Establishes within the executive branch the National Invasive Species Council to ensure that Federal agency efforts concerning invasive species are coordinated, effective, complementary, and cost-efficient.Requires the Council to develop a National Invasive Species Management Plan that details and recommends performance-oriented goals.Requires the Council to create the Invasive Species Advisory Committee to provide information and advice for consideration by the Council.Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to prepare and submit to Congress and the Council a yearly budget analysis and summary of all Federal programs relating to invasive species."
