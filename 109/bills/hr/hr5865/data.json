Amends title XI of the Social Security Act (SSA) with respect to the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide temporary assistance to U.S. citizens and their dependents if they: (1) are identified by the Department of State as having returned, or been brought, from a foreign country to the United States because of the citizen's destitution or the citizen's or a dependent's illness, or because of war, threat of war, invasion, or similar crisis; and (2) are without available resources. Increases from $1 million to $6 million the maximum total amount of such temporary assistance provided during FY2006. Amends SSA title IV part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) to provide that if a state agency responsible for administration of the food stamp program under the Food Stamp Act of 1977 transmits to the Secretary of Health and Human Services the names and Social Security account numbers of individuals, the Secretary shall disclose to the state agency information on them and their employers maintained in the National Directory of New Hires. Requires the Secretary to make such a disclosure only to the extent that it would not interfere with the effective operation of the child support and establishment of paternity program. Prohibits a state agency from disclosing information provided under this Act except for purposes for administering a food stamp program. Prescribes data security and control policies and establishes a penalty for misuse of information."
