Requires the Secretary to sell gasoline from the GAS Reserve upon written notification by a state Governor that cites a physical disruption in the system supplying gasoline to the Governor's state likely to result in price volatility for retail gasoline markets in that state. Prescribes guidelines under which the Secretary is authorized to conduct purchases and sales of gasoline at wholesale for maintenance of the GAS Reserve system."
