    "text": "Child, Worker, and Consumer-Safe Chemicals Act of 2005 or the Kid Safe Chemicals Act - Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to require each manufacturer of a chemical substance distributed in commerce to submit to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): (1) a statement certifying that the manufacturer's chemical substance meets required safety standards or there is insufficient data to make such determination; and (2) all reasonably available information concerning the chemical substance not previously submitted. Requires manufacturers to update such information at least every three years or at any time new information becomes available on the toxicity of a chemical substance. Prohibits the manufacture of a chemical substance if the Administrator: (1) determines that the manufacturer has failed to comply with this Act or that the substance does not meet applicable safety standards; or (2) has not made a safety determination for such substance within a specified time period. Requires the Administrator to: (1) develop a priority list for making safety determinations of at least 300 chemical substances, giving highest priority to substances posing the greatest risk to humans; (2) determine whether a manufacturer has established that its priority list substances meet applicable safety standards; (3) implement animal testing alternatives; (4) create market incentives for the development of safer alternatives to existing chemical substances; (5) establish an Interagency Science Advisory Board on Children's Health and Toxic Substances; (6) cooperate with international efforts to monitor chemical substances; and (7) create a database to share information on the toxicity and use of chemical substances and provide public access to such data."
