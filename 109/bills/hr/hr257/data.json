Adds grounds for discretionary waiver of inadmissibility. Authorizes K nonimmigrant status for specified family members of lawful permanent residents (LPRs) and additional family members of U.S. citizens who are awaiting immigrant visas. Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) to disregard as aggravated felonies (with immigration consequences) certain criminal convictions. Provides that a person who is a child on the last day of the 90-day period after a pending application for INA benefits is filed shall be considered to be a child for all purposes related to such application. Clarifies that the term \"child\" includes children for whom adoption proceedings were initiated prior to specified ages. Authorizes the Secretary to waive certain bars to admission.
