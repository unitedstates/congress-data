(Sec. 4) Establishes the Long Island Sound Stewardship Initiative Region within Connecticut and New York. (Sec. 5) Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to designate as a stewardship site any area that contributes to accomplishing the purpose of this Act. Requires the Administrator to provide: (1) a public comment period on the list of sites recommended by the Long Island Sound Stewardship Advisory Committee (established by this Act); and (2) an opportunity for owners of such sites to decline designation. Prohibits the Administrator from designating an area as a stewardship site unless the owner of the area is provided, and acknowledges the receipt of, an opinion of the owner's responsibility that arises from such designation. Requires the Administrator to review recommendations of the Committee. Authorizes the Administrator to designate as a stewardship site any site included on the Committee's list.
