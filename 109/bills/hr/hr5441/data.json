(Sec. 515) Prohibits the use of funds to: (1) amend the oath of allegiance required for naturalization; (2) process or approve a competition under Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 for services provided as of June 1, 2004, by DHS Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services Immigration Information Officers, Contact Representatives, or Investigative Assistants; and (3) make Secret Service funds available for the protection of persons other than the Secretary.

Authorizes any individual aggrieved by a violation of this Act to seek relief by bringing an action for redress and by bringing a civil action in U.S. district court for return of a confiscated firearm. (Sec. 558) Requires the Secretary to: (1) designate three foreign seaports through which containers pass or are transshipped to the United States to pilot an integrated scanning system that couples non-intrusive imaging equipment and radiation detection equipment, which may be provided by the Megaports Initiative of the Department of Energy (DOE); (2) consider three distinct ports with unique features and differing levels of trade volume; and (3) collaborate with the Secretary of Energy and cooperate with the private sector and host foreign governments to implement the pilot program. Requires the Secretary, within one year, to achieve a full-scale implementation of the screening system, which shall: (1) scan all containers destined for the United States that transit through the terminal; (2) electronically transmit the images and information to the container security initiative personnel in the host country and/or CBP personnel in the United States for evaluation and analysis; (3) resolve every radiation alarm according to established procedures; (4) utilize the information collected to enhance the Automated Targeting System (ATS) or other relevant programs; and (5) store the information for later retrieval and analysis. Directs the Secretary to: (1) determine whether such system has a sufficiently low false alarm rate, can be operated at ports overseas and integrated with existing systems, does not significantly impact trade capacity and flow of cargo, and provides an automated notification of questionable or high-risk cargo as a trigger for further inspection; (2) report on the pilot program, the efficacy of the ATS in utilizing the images captured to examine high-risk containers, the software capable of automatically identifying potential anomalies in scanned containers, and expanding the integrated scanning system to other container security initiative ports; and (3) seek to secure foreign government cooperation to initiate use of such technology at foreign ports to scan all cargo bound for the United States as quickly as possible. Title VI: National Emergency Management - (Sec. 601) Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 - Subtitle A: Federal Emergency Management Agency - Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (the Act) to keep FEMA within DHS and to provide that FEMA's primary mission is to reduce the loss of life and property and protect the nation from all hazards by leading and supporting the nation in a risk-based, comprehensive emergency management system of preparedness, protection, response, recovery, and mitigation. Requires the Administrator of FEMA to: (1) be appointed by the President from among individuals who have a demonstrated ability in and knowledge of emergency management and homeland security and not less than five years of executive leadership and management experience in the public or private sector; and (2) report to the Secretary without being required to report through any other DHS official.
