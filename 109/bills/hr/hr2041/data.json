    "text": "Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act of 2005 - Establishes the Interagency Committee to Coordinate and Streamline Homeland Security Grant Programs. Creates the position of Executive Director to head the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS's) Office for State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness (OSLGCP). Reconstitutes the DHS Office for Domestic Preparedness as a component of the OSLGCP (currently, within the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security) and gives it responsibility for managing the Homeland Security Information Clearinghouse. Establishes the Homeland Security Information Clearinghouse within the OSLGCP. Preserves specified Federal grant programs for traditional first responder missions that existed prior to September 11, 2001. Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish: (1) clearly defined essential capabilities for State and local governments; and (2) a Task Force on Essential Capabilities for First Responders. Establishes a Threat-Based Homeland Security Grant Program for States and local governments. Requires a State applying for a grant to have an approved three-year homeland security plan. Provides for the reallocation of funds received under the State Homeland Security Grant Program. Directs the Secretary to promulgate national voluntary consensus standards for first responder equipment and training. Requires the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection to report to Congress: (1) on whether the methodologies and technologies used to screen municipal solid waste entering the United States for chemical, nuclear, biological, and radiological weapons are as effective as screening methods for other items of commerce; and (2) if not, on actions the Bureau will take to ensure comparable levels of screening. Requires the Secretary, if such actions are not taken within a specified period, to deny entry to commercial motor vehicles carrying municipal solid waste until the Secretary certifies to Congress that comparable screening levels have been achieved."
