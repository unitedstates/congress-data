Directs the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) develop such formula, which shall be established and provided to the HHS Secretary by March 31, 2006; and (2) periodically review (and revise as appropriate) the formula to accurately distribute funds based on risk. Makes a revision ineffective for a fiscal year unless it is approved by both Secretaries by July 1 of the preceding year."
