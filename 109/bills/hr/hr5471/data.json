Directs the Secretary to provide to the Transit Mixed Concrete Corporation (TMC) other financial and mineral production opportunities in exchange for the economic value invested in trying to bring leases CA-20139 and CA-22901 into commercial production. Requires TMC to submit to the Secretary an itemized list with supporting documentation so the Secretary can determine that expenses associated with the leases are reasonable. Prohibits the Secretary from issuing leases for mining sand and gravel in the Soledad Canyon area of California that in the aggregate authorize mining exceeding historical production levels. Requires the Secretary, before issuing any lease authorizing the mining of sand or gravel in such area, to: (1) consult with the city of Santa Clarita, California, Los Angeles County, California, and the surface owners in the area; and (2) take into consideration the environmental and transportation concerns of such mining on the area."
