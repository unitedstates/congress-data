    "text": "Iris Scan Security Act of 2005 - Authorizes the Attorney General to award grants to enable states to: (1) include in state criminal records systems iris scan information obtained from individuals prohibited by federal or state law from possessing or receiving a firearm by reason of having been convicted in state court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year or a misdemeanor domestic violence crime; and (2) provide such information electronically to the national instant criminal background check (NICS) system. Requires a state grantee to: (1) provide to the NICS system such information from the database as the Attorney General may require; and (2) not disclose any information in the database except for a law enforcement purpose. Directs the Attorney General to prescribe regulations necessary to ensure that the system is equipped to receive iris scan information and to use the information in responding to requests from licensees for information about whether receipt of a firearm by a prospective transferee would violate federal or state law. Amends the code to prohibit the transfer of a firearm by a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer to an unlicensed individual unless the licensee performs an iris scan and provides the NICS system electronically with the information obtained from the scan."
