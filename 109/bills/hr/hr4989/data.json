Sets forth requirements for ensuring adequate staff and equipment at polling places. Applies certain election administration requirements to early voting sites. Provides for: (1) the availability of additional funds to enable states to meet requirements with respect to adequate staff and equipment at polling places; and (2) the issuance of durable voter registration cards. Amends the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 to prescribe notice and review requirements for removal of individuals from the official list of eligible voters by reason other than change of residence. Revises requirements for the contents and treatment of voter registration forms. Requires state or local election officials to ensure the availability of updated information for registered voters."
