Establishes, in addition, a civil penalty of $1,000 for each day of insurance coverage lapse that results from such a failure. Earmarks the fines thus collected for assistance to: (1) low-income families for the acquisition of a principal residence; and (2) nonprofit organizations that engage in legal advocacy relating to consumer rights' protection."
