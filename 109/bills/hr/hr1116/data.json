Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to eligible transportation agencies for: (1) the training of frontline transit employees in emergency preparedness and response activities; and (2) the acquisition of approved equipment and technologies to assist in carrying them out. Requires allocation of grant amounts among eligible transportation agencies based on need for emergency preparedness and response training and equipment, earmarking at least ten percent of such amounts to eligible transportation agencies in non-urban areas."
