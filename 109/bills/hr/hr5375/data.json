    "text": "New Options Petroleum Energy Conservation Act of 2006 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include any climate neutral combustion resource as a qualified energy resource for purposes of the tax credit for producing electricity from renewable sources. Defines \"climate neutral combustion resource\" as any facility which: (1) captures and uses carbon dioxide released during combustion to recover hydrocarbon fuel; (2) produces no emissions of mercury or greenhouse gases and no emissions that form fine particles, smog, or acid rain; and (3) is owned by the taxpayer and is placed in service after 2006. Extends through 2011 the tax credits for investment in solar energy property and for residential energy efficient property.Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to award $1 billion to the first U.S. automobile manufacturer who manufactures and sells in the United States 60,000 midsized sedans which operate on gasoline and can travel at 100 miles per gallon. Authorizes appropriations for the development of advanced lithium ion battery technology. Allows a taxpayer election to expense biofuel refining property"
