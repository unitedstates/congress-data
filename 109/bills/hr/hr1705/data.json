    "text": "Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to: (1) review and update mobile source air emission models to determine whether they accurately reflect the emissions resulting from long-duration idling of heavy-duty vehicles and other vehicles and engines; (2) review emission reductions achieved by the use of idle reduction technology; and (3) complete such revisions of EPA regulations and guidance as the Administrator determines to be appropriate. Instructs the Administrator to establish a program to support deployment of idle reduction and energy conservation technologies, giving priority to deployment based on the costs and beneficial effects on air quality and ability to lessen the emission of criteria air pollutants. Directs the Administrator to commence a study to analyze all locations at which heavy-duty vehicles stop for long-duration idling. States that in order to promote reduction of fuel use and emissions because of engine idling, the maximum gross vehicle weight limit and the axle weight limit for any heavy-duty vehicle equipped with an idle reduction technology shall be increased by a quantity necessary to compensate for the additional weight of the idle reduction system."
