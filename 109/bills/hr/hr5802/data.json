    "text": "NPS Concessions Reform Act of 2006 - Amends the National Park Service Concessions Management Improvement Act of 1998 to increase the anticipated annual gross receipts eligible for a concessioner's preferential right of renewal. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to provide to any entity that submitted a proposal and who was not awarded a proposed concessions contract a debriefing as to why it was not selected as submitting the best proposal for that concessions contract. States that, such debriefing must be requested and must be made within 90 days of the award of the concessions contract. Bars the Secretary from being required to disclose any proprietary information of the entity that was selected as submitting the best proposal and awarded such contract. Permits a leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement upon U.S.-owned land within a unit of the National Park Service (NPS) under a concession contract to be pledged as security for NPS contracts using a combination of leasehold surrender interest if holding one or more contracts with the NPS, and prohibits the proceeds resulting from such pledged security from being restricted for use in the park or parks for which the leasehold surrender interest was pledged. Revises guidelines governing commercial use authorizations."
