    "text": "Angie Fatino Save Our Children from Meth Act of 2005 - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to direct the Attorney General to transfer to schedule V ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine. Makes this provision inapplicable with respect to pseudoephedrine when contained in a product that is in a liquid, liquid capsule, or liquid-filled gel capsule, that does not contain more than 360 milligrams of pseudoephedrine, and that is approved under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (pseudoephedrine contained in such product shall then be considered a list I chemical). Revises the definition of \"regulated transaction\" to exclude specified transactions involving drugs or products that the Attorney General determines are being diverted for illicit purposes. Places restrictions on the sale of list I and schedule V pseudoephedrine products. Requires a registrant of list I products to: (1) place the products where the customers do not have direct access to them; (2) maintain a sales logbook that identifies the products, purchasers, dates, and times of sales; and (3) not sell such a product to persons under age 18. Prohibits a registrant of schedule V products that do not require prescriptions from dispensing such a product to a prospective purchaser under age 18. Sets penalties for violations. Prohibits any person from knowingly or intentionally purchasing at retail: (1) more than one list I pseudoephedrine product during a 24-hour period without a prescription; (2) more than 7,500 milligrams of pseudoephedrine in list I or schedule V products during a 30-day period without a prescription; or (3) such a list I product without legibly signing the appropriate logbook."
