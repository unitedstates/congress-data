Excepts pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine when contained in a drug that is in liquid or gel form marketed or distributed lawfully in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), which shall be considered a listed chemical. Makes such requirement and exception subject to the Attorney General's authority to designate substances as controlled or listed chemicals. Amends CSA to revise the definition of \"regulated transaction\" to: (1) provide that the threshold for any distributor sale of products containing pseudoephedrine products in liquid or gel form, or containing phenylpropanolamine products, shall be nine grams of pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine; and (2) specify as a \"chemical mixture\" a transaction in which is excluded from such definition a mixture that may be marketed or distributed lawfully in the United States under FDCA."
