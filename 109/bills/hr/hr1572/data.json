Revises the declaration that the coordination requirements for plans providing prescription drug coverage shall not impair or prevent a prescription drug plan (PDP) sponsor or Medicare Advantage (MA) organization from applying cost management tools (including differential payments) under its own methods of operation. Declares further that a PDP sponsor or MA organization may not require a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program or an RX plan to apply such cost management tools when coordinating benefits. Amends SSA title XIX (Medicaid) to repeal current requirements governing the coordination of prescription drug benefits."
