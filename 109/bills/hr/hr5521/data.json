Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect the authority of the Librarian of Congress regarding LOC collection security. Deems such transferred employees to be members of the Capitol Police. Allows such transfer if: (1) based on the assumption that such employee would perform a period of continuous federal service after the transfer date, the individual would be entitled to an annuity for immediate retirement under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) on the date the employee becomes 60 years of age and has completed 20 years of service; and (2) the Chief of the Capitol Police (Chief) makes a determination that the employee meets the qualifications required to be a member of the Capitol Police. Requires each eligible LOC Police employee to request a qualification determination from the Chief. Requires the employee to complete successfully any training determined by the Chief.

Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize: (1) any labor organization that represented an LOC Police employee before the transfer to represent that individual as a member of the Capitol Police after such transfer; or (2) any collective bargaining agreement (or any related court order, stipulated agreement, or agreement to the terms or conditions of employment) applicable to LOC Police employees to apply to members of the Capitol Police. Authorizes the Capitol Police Board to allocate or reallocate any function transferred under this Act among members of the Capitol Police, and to establish, consolidate, alter, or discontinue such organizational entities in the Capitol Police as may be necessary or appropriate. Authorizes the Chief, during the period preceding the transfer, to detail additional members of the Capitol Police to the LOC, without reimbursement, equal to or less than the number of LOC Police employees who are in training at any time.

Repeals the authority of the Librarian of Congress to designate LOC Police employees, and the jurisdiction of such employees within LOC buildings, grounds, and adjacent streets. Repeals certain prohibitions currently specified as under LOC Police jurisdiction. Provides that, subject to the Memorandum of Understanding, any individual who remains an LOC Police employee on or after the transfer shall remain in such capacity and functions as if this Act had not been enacted. Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect Librarian of Congress authority to: (1) terminate such an individual's employment; or (2) transfer him or her to another LOC position. States that as of September 30, 2008: (1) all LOC Police employee positions are terminated; (2) any individual employed in such position on that date and entitled to an annuity for immediate retirement shall be separated from service for retirement; and (3) the Librarian of Congress shall separate from service any individual employed in such position on that date (other than an individual eligible for immediate retirement).

The Librarian of Congress shall provide for collections security within the LOC. Authorizes the Librarian of Congress to enter into contracts for goods and services and to coordinate with the Chief with respect to such security. Requires the Memorandum of Understanding between the LOC and the Capitol Police entered into on December 12, 2004, to remain in effect through FY2008, subject to: (1) the provisions of this Act; and (2) such modifications as may be made in accordance with the modification and dispute resolution provisions of the Memorandum, consistent with this Act. Requires the Librarian of Congress to reimburse, from any available funds, Capitol Police appropriations accounts for services performed by the Capitol Police at any LOC event. (Sec. 1003) Authorizes the Chief to make advance payments for any contract relating to an information and workflow system for the management of human capital life cycle processes if making such advance payments is more prompt, efficient, or economical in the interest of carrying out required activities and operations of the Capitol Police. Requires the Chief to notify the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations before exercising such authority. (Sec. 1004) Requires the Capitol Police Board to appoint an individual to the position of General Counsel for the U.S. Capitol Police Board and the Chief without regard to political affiliation and solely on the basis of fitness to perform the duties of the position.
