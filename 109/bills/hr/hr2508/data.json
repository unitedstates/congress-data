Directs the Secretary of Education to make grants to institutions of higher education to provide: (1) technical assistance and supportive services to foster care youth who are prospective students to prepare for, enter, and remain in such institutions; and (2) basic housing during the regular academic school year, including interim housing during regular periods of dormitory closing other than summer break, for those foster care youth living in college dormitories. Requires program coordination with: (1) the John H. Chafee foster care independence program under the Social Security Act; and (2) TRIO and GEAR UP programs under HEA. Revises HEA financial need analysis to provide fair treatment for foster care youth. Provides, for foster care youth and other students with special circumstances, a simplified determination of independence and a tailoring of electronic applications."
