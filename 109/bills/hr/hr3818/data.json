Directs the Secretary to require such terms and conditions in an agreement as are necessary to protect investments to be made by the United States, including terms related to the ownership of any facilities or improvements constructed or improved under such an agreement. Sets forth provisions concerning: (1) cost-sharing, including providing for in-kind contributions; and (2) the treatment of funds received under an agreement. Repeals certain authorities relating to: (1) cooperative arrangements for the printing of educational materials and the continuation of the Challenge Cost Share Program; and (2) Watershed Restoration and Enhancement Agreements."
