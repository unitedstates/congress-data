Defines \"qualified health benefit purchasing coalition\" as a private non-profit corporation which sells health insurance to employers through State licensed health insurance issuers. Directs: (1) the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award demonstration grants to States to develop innovative ways to increase access to health insurance through market reforms and other means; and (2) the Small Business Administration (SBA) to award grants to States, local governments, and nonprofit organizations to provide information to small employers about the benefits of health insurance."
