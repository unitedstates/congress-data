Calls upon the President and Secretary of State to affirm as U.S. policy that Jerusalem must remain Israel's undivided capital. Urges the President to: (1) discontinue use of the waiver contained in the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995; (2) carry out such Act's provisions immediately; and (3) begin the process of relocating the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Urges U.S. officials, upon request, to record the birthplace of a U.S. citizen born in Jerusalem as Israel (as provided for by the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003)."
