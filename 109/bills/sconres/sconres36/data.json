Calls on all parties participating in the Seventh Review Conference on the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons to make good faith efforts to: (1) comply with NPT nonproliferation obligations; (2) establish more effective controls on sensitive technologies that can be used to produce nuclear weapons material; (3) expand the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) inspection and monitoring ability; (4) demonstrate the international community's opposition to the Iranian nuclear weapons program; (5) support U.S. diplomatic efforts in the context of the six-party talks to dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons programs; (6) pursue diplomacy to address regional security problems in Northeast Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East, which would facilitate nonproliferation and disarmament efforts in those regions; (7) accelerate programs to safeguard and eliminate nuclear weapons-usable material; (8) halt the use of highly enriched uranium in civilian reactors; (9) strengthen national and international export controls and relevant security measures; (10) agree that no state may withdraw from the NPT and escape responsibility for prior Treaty violations or retain access to controlled materials and equipment acquired for \"peaceful\" purposes; (11) accelerate efforts to reduce stockpiles of nuclear weapons and weapons-grade fissile material; and (12) strengthen Proliferation Security Initiative support."
