    "text": "Condemns the actions taken by President Hugo Chavez Frias to: (1) increase his control over Venezuela's democratic institutions and eliminate opposition to his rule as detrimental to democracy in Venezuela and to regional stability; and (2) support radical forces in Colombia, Ecuador, and Bolivia in an effort to destabilize those nations. Calls for an end to the continued verbal assaults on the United States. Supports the efforts of the Venezuelan democratic civil society to create the conditions for a a free election process and open dialogue within Venezuela and the international community. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) it should be U.S. policy to support democratic forces in Venezuela, and to work with the international community, including the Organization of American States (OAS), to assist democratic forces in Venezuela; (2) it is critical that the 2006 elections in Venezuela be free and transparent; and (3) the U.S. government should provide assistance and material support to Venezuelan nongovernmental organizations and to political parties, ensuring that the assistance goes for party strengthening and be open to all legitimate Venezuelan political forces."
