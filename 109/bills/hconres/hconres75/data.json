Urges the President to take action to prevent the illegal importation of prescription drugs from Canada or any other foreign country, and the U.S. Trade Representative to act to correct the inequities and discrimination caused by Canada's Patented Medicine Pricing Review Board. Urges the pharmaceutical industry and the health care community to: (1) begin a nationwide educational awareness program for U.S. consumers regarding the dangers of imported drugs; and (2) work to ensure that all citizens have access to prescription drugs with the same level of safety and efficacy guaranteed under the current system of regulation. Declares that: (1) it is essential that U.S. patients have access to affordable prescription drugs; and (2) deregulating foreign prices would increase the flow of new drugs to U.S. consumers."
