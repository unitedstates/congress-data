Expresses support for: (1) the people of Egypt as they struggle for democracy; and (2) President George W. Bush's call for greater democracy in Egypt. Encourages: (1) the President and the Secretary of State to assist human rights activists and the nonviolent democratic opposition in Egypt; and (2) the People's Assembly of Egypt to follow through on President Mubarak's call for changes to the Egyptian Constitution that would permit direct, contested presidential elections."
