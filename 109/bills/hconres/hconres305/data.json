Affirms the vital importance of lawful regulated hunting in maintaining healthy populations of wildlife. Declares, as a matter of principle, that no federal law should be passed which limits the taking and consumptive use of wildlife, except reasonable laws to: (1) ensure the safety of hunters and the continued perpetuation of wildlife; (2) protect endangered species; (3) protect species not traditionally considered as game or suitable for consumptive use; and (4) ensure hunting is carried out in a sportsmanlike manner."
