    "text": "Consumer Phone Record Security Act of 2006 - Makes it unlawful for a person to: (1) obtain, or attempt to obtain, through fraud an individual's customer proprietary network information (CPNI), or cause, or attempt to cause, such individual's CPNI to be disclosed to another person without that person's authorization; (2) sell, or offer for sale, a person's CPNI without their authorization; or (3) request another person to obtain a person's CPNI from a telecommunications carrier without proper authorization (with an exception authorizing a law enforcement official to obtain a person's CPNI provided certain conditions are met). Requires enforcement of the requirements of this Act by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and the states. Authorizes a person whose CPNI has been obtained, used, or sold in violation of the requirements of this Act to file an action for civil relief against the violator in the appropriate court. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require telecommunications carriers to implement certain measures to protect a person's CPNI."
