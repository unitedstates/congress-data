Requires the Commission to report to the President and Congress on its findings and conclusions. Authorizes the Commission to establish a multidisciplinary science, economic, and technical advisory panel. Requires the panel to ensure that the scientific information considered by the Commission is based on the best available data. Encourages the Commission, Congress, and federal agencies to continue the dialogue about global environmental security after the Commission is terminated (30 days after the submittal of its report to Congress) and to examine institutional needs, including the formation of a new office. Requires the President to submit to Congress and agencies a report containing a statement of proposals to carry out or respond to the Commission's recommendations."
