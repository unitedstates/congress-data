(Sec. 5) Designates the Utah Heritage Highway 89 Alliance (the Alliance) as the Heritage Area's management entity. Prohibits the Alliance from using Federal funds provided under this Act to acquire real property. (Sec. 6) Requires the Board of Directors of the Alliance, with public participation, to develop and submit for review to the Secretary of the Interior a management plan for the Area. Requires the management plan to provide for recommendations for the conservation, funding, management, and development of the Heritage Area and to include an interpretive plan for such Area. Requires the Alliance to: (1) submit annual reports to the Secretary for any fiscal year in which the Alliance receives Federal funds under this Act or in which a loan made by the Alliance with Federal funds to the State, political subdivisions of the State, nonprofit organizations, and other persons under this Act is outstanding; and (2) cooperate with audits by Congress, the Secretary, and appropriate units of government under such circumstances. (Sec. 7) Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance and grants to: (1) units of government, non-profit organizations, and other persons; and (2) the Alliance for developing and implementing the management plan. Prohibits the Secretary, as a condition of the award of technical assistance or grants, from requiring any recipient of such assistance or grant to enact or modify any land use restrictions. (Sec. 8) Specifies that nothing in this Act: (1) modifies, enlarges, or diminishes any authority of Federal, State, or local government to regulate any use of land under any other law (including regulations); (2) grants zoning powers or land use control to the Alliance; and (3) affects or authorizes the Alliance to interfere with any person's right with respect to private property or any local zoning ordinance or land use plan of the State or a political subdivision of the State. (Sec. 9) Authorizes appropriations. Limits: (1) the amount that may be made available for any fiscal year to not more than $1 million; and (2) the Federal cost share of any activities carried out using funds made available under this Act to 50 percent.
