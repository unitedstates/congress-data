Prohibits the commencement of a prosecution against any such contractor if a foreign government has prosecuted or is prosecuting such person for the offense, except upon specified approval. Permits an individual who is a victim of such a violation by a federal contractor to bring a civil action if a civil action would have been authorized had the conduct been engaged in within U.S. jurisdiction."
