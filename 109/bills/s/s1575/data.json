Directs the Secretary to award specified numbers and amounts of grants for FY2006-FY2010, subject to specified limitations. Directs: (1) the Secretary to evaluate and report to Congress on the results of activities carried out under such grants; and (2) the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress concerning activities to increase participation in the nurse educator program."
