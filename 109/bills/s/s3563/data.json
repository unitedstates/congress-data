Directs the Secretary to: (1) initiate the planning, design, and construction of the project alternative that is selected; and (2) develop and implement an emergency response plan to be followed in the event of a catastrophic infrastructure failure. Establishes in the Treasury an emergency response plan fund. Requires: (1) the Milk River Project to be operated primarily for irrigation purposes; and (2) the Secretary to prioritize Project structures in need of rehabilitation and improvement. Directs the Secretary to: (1) ensure that land and water rights held in trust for the benefit of the Blackfeet Tribe are protected; (2) resolve tribal claims against the United States; (3) identify appropriate Blackfeet projects to improve economic conditions on the Reservation; (4) complete studies to determine the feasibility of carrying out such projects; and (5) conduct studies to determine the feasibility of rehabilitating and improving Blackfeet irrigation project structures determined to be in need based on the appraisal investigation and of developing a safe and adequate rural, municipal, and industrial water supply project for the residents of the Fort Belknap Reservation and surrounding communities."
