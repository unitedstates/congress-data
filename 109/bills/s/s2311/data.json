    "text": "Older Americans Sustainable Mobility Act of 2006 - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Assistant Secretary for Aging, to establish a demonstration project to enable qualified persons (specified older, blind, or visually impaired individuals and qualified passengers) to obtain: (1) economically sustainable transportation services (demand-responsive transportation services by automobile by a combination of volunteer and paid drivers) from economically sustainable transportation providers (nonprofit transportation providers that receive funding to connect to, and provide economically sustainable services through, a national network of transportation providers); and (2) transportation services from qualified transportation providers (nonprofit, public, or licensed private transportation providers that connect to and provide transportation through such network). Allows an income tax credit for 30% of the value of transportation services allocated to a transportation account of a qualified individual in exchange for the transfer of a motor vehicle to an economically sustainable transportation provider. Directs the Secretary to make grants to such transportation providers to pay for the federal share of the costs of acquiring and using technology to connect to the national network and the costs of participating in, and providing economically sustainable transportation services through, the network."
