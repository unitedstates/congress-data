Directs the Secretary and the Attorney General to conduct a study of the manufacturing and distribution process of cyanide to determine actions to safeguard the public from its wrongful use, particularly by terrorists, including a determination as to the feasibility and desirability of establishing a central registry of all lot specifications of cyanide to provide quick access to investigative and law enforcement agencies."
