    "text": "Strengthening America's Workforce Act of 2005 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to: (1) amend the definition of H-2B nonimmigrant worker; and (2) add a new H-2C nonimmigrant worker category (willing worker program). Requires employers seeking to hire H-2B or H-2C workers to undertake specified recruitment efforts for U.S. workers, and to submit specified labor attestations. Provides worker protections. Addresses portability. Provides derivative status for spouses and children of H-2B and H-2C workers. Establishes annual numerical limitations on the number of aliens who may receive H-2B and H-2C status. Specifies authorized periods of admission for each category. Establishes the Immigration Study Commission to review the impact of this Act on national security and the economy and families. Sets forth H-2B and H-2C alien provisions respecting: (1) nonimmigrant status change and permanent immigrant status adjustment; (2) exemption from certain grounds for inadmissibility; (3) employer petition fees; (4) collective bargaining coverage; and (5) status ineligibility. Provides for stays of removal for aliens involved in workplace claims. Prohibits disclosure to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) by a federal or state agency of information concerning the immigration status of any worker. Triples civil penalties for a commercial enterprise that commits immigration-related document fraud for commercial or financial advantage. Exempts from fiscal year admission limits foreign students who have earned an advanced degree in science, technology, engineering or math from a U.S. university or who are employed. Exempts from direct numerical limitations: (1) aliens with an advanced degree in science, technology, engineering, or math who have been working in a related field in the United States during the three-year period preceding their application for an employment-based immigrant visa; (2) certain aliens who are priority workers or who have received a national interest waiver; and (3) immediate relatives of an employment-based immigrant. Authorizes full-time foreign students to work part-time off campus. Requires employer attestation respecting: (1) wages; (2) hours; and (3) U.S. citizen recruitment."
