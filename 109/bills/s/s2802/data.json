Authorizes appropriations for each program. (Sec. 303) Requires the NSF Director to: (1) establish a clearinghouse, in collaboration with four-year institutions of higher education and federal agencies that employ science-trained personnel, to share program elements used in successful professional science masters degree programs and other advanced degree programs related to science, mathematics, technology, and engineering; (2) make such clearinghouse available to institutions of higher education that are developing professional science masters degree programs; and (3) award grants for pilot programs to four-year institutions of higher education to facilitate the creation or improvement of such degree programs. Provides a grant preference to applicants that secure more than two-thirds of degree program funding from sources other than the federal government. Allows the award of up to 200 grants, each for a three-year period. Requires the NSF Director to evaluate the pilot program and report results to Congress. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 304) Authorizes appropriations for FY2007-FY2010 to carry out the physical science, mathematics, engineering, and technology talent expansion program of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002. Amends such Act to encourage students involved in such programs to conduct outreach at middle and secondary schools in order to increase student exposure to engineering and technology. (Sec. 305) Requires the NSF Director, in considering NSF science research proposals and awards, to include consideration of the degree to which awards and research activities may assist in meeting critical national needs in innovation, competitiveness, the physical and natural sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics. (Sec. 306) Authorizes appropriations for FY2007-FY2011 for the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research under the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1988. (Sec. 307) Requires the NSF Director to establish a program to provide: (1) mentors for women interested in careers in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics; and (2) grants to community colleges to provide apprenticeships and other appropriate training to allow women to enter into higher-paying technical jobs in fields related to science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. Requires evaluations of each program. (Sec. 308) Requires the NSF Director to develop and publish a plan that describes the current status of broadband access for scientific research in certain states and outlines actions which can be taken to ensure that such connections are available to enable participation in those NSF programs which rely heavily on high-speed networking and collaborations across institutions and regions. (Sec. 309) States that nothing in this Act shall be interpreted to require or recommend that the NSF: (1) alter or modify its merit-review system or peer-review process; or (2) exclude the awarding of any proposal by means of the merit-review or peer-review process. Title IV: National Aeronautics and Space Administration - (Sec. 401) Expresses the sense of Congress: (1) recognizing the critical role that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has played in stimulating excellence in the advancement of physical science and engineering disciplines and the pursuit of academic studies in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; and (2) that a robust and fully-funded NASA could attract and employ scientists, engineers, and technicians across a broad range of fields in such studies. Directs the NASA Administrator to fully participate in any interagency efforts to promote innovation and economic competitiveness through scientific research and development. (Sec. 402) Directs the NASA Administrator to establish an Aeronautics Institute for Research to manage NASA aeronautics research. (Sec. 403) Requires the NASA Administrator, the NSF Director, and the Secretaries of Energy, Defense, and Commerce to coordinate basic and fundamental research activities related to physical sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
