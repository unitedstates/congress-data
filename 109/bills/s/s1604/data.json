Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to issue regulations as necessary to repeal such provisions, including removing any applicable prohibition on transactions or payments. Authorizes U.S. courts to recognize, enforce, or otherwise validate an assertion of rights in any mark or trade name based on common law rights, registration under the Trademark Act of 1946, or any treaty to which the United States is a party."
