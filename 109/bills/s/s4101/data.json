    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "2006-12-07", 
    "text": "Stormwater Enforcement and Permitting Act of 2006 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide an operator a reasonable opportunity to correct a violation of a permit condition for a site with residential construction activity before initiation of an enforcement action, if such violation may be rectified by modifying, revising, or supplementing records or paperwork. Prohibits such an opportunity from being provided: (1) to the operator of any residential construction site that failed to obtain coverage under a national pollutant discharge elimination system permit; or (2) for a record or paperwork violation that resulted in a violation of a water quality standard. Prohibits more than one opportunity to correct violations of the same condition. Prohibits the Administrator from requiring a permit for stormwater runoff from such a site if: (1) the runoff enters a municipal separate storm sewer system that is covered by a permit and the operator is in compliance with runoff requirements; and (2) such site has minimal potential for soil erosion. Requires the Administrator to coordinate enforcement of stormwater discharge permits with states. Prohibits the Administrator from paying any state penalty for a violation of a permit for such a discharge. Requires the Administrator to establish a program that will develop and distribute to site operators a pamphlet that explains permitting requirements for stormwater discharges. Authorizes the Administrator or the state to issue a general permit for no more than five years on a state, regional, or nationwide basis to cover any category of discharges, sludge use, disposal practices, or facilities. Declares that the Administrator or state is not required to review, approve, or provide an opportunity for public comment on any application for a discharge under a general permit."
