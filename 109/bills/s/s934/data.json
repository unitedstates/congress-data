Authorizes the ranking minority party member of a committee, if the chair fails to introduce the bill within the 30-day period, to introduce one that will qualify for the expedited procedure provided in this Act. Qualifies a bill if: (1) its title reads \"to reform the health care system of the United States and to provide insurance coverage for Americans;\" (2) it reaches the goal of providing health care coverage to 95 % of Americans within 10 years; and (3) it is deficit neutral. Sets forth procedures for expedited consideration of such legislation in both chambers."
