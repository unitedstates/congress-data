    "text": "Law-Enforcement Officers' Protection Act of 2005 - Amends the federal criminal code to prohibit killing or attempting to kill a federally funded public safety officer (including a judicial officer). Establishes or increases penalties for: (1) assaulting such an officer, federal judge, and other federal official; (2) retaliating against such an officer, judge, or official by murdering or assaulting a family member; and (3) murder, manslaughter, and related crimes under federal jurisdiction. Dr. John B. Jamison Act - Amends the federal judicial code to deny a court, justice, or judge jurisdiction to consider any claim relating to the judgment or sentence in an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to a state court judgment for killing a public safety officer, unless specified conditions apply. Requires the court to ensure that, in a federal habeas corpus proceeding arising out of a state conviction, a crime victim is afforded specified rights. Limits to out of pocket expenditures and other monetary loss the damages that may be recovered (and prohibits the recovery of attorney fees) by an individual seeking redress for a deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities incurred in or resulting from felony or criminally violent conduct by such individual, including any deprivation in the course of his or her arrest, apprehension, investigation, prosecution, or adjudication. Redefines \"qualified retired law enforcement officer\" for purposes of a provision allowing such an officer to carry a concealed firearm by lowering from 15 to 10 years the amount of time such officer must have been regularly employed as a law enforcement officer. Increases penalties for: (1) injuring or influencing a judicial officer or juror; and (2) tampering with, or retaliating against, a witness, victim, or informant. Prohibits: (1) filing in any public record or private record which is generally available to the public a false lien or encumbrance against the property of a federally funded public safety officer or other federal officer or employee; and (2) knowingly making restricted personal information about a federal officer or employee, juror, witness, officer of any court, or officer serving at any proceeding before a U.S. magistrate judge publicly available with the intent that it be used to threaten or intimidate such official or to kidnap, injure, or threaten such official or an immediate family member."
