    "text": "Stabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act of 2005 - States that the purpose of this Act is to provide for the development, as a core mission of the Department of State and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), of an expert civilian response capability to carry out stabilization and reconstruction activities in a country or region that is in, or is in transition from, conflict or civil strife. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President to furnish assistance and permit the export of goods and services to assist in stabilizing and reconstructing a country or region that is in, or is in transition from, conflict or civil strife. Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to direct the Secretary of State to establish an Office of International Stabilization and Reconstruction. Authorizes the Secretary to establish: (1) a Response Readiness Corps, in consultation with the Administrator of USAID, to provide stabilization and reconstruction activities in foreign countries or regions that are in, or are in transition from, conflict or civil strife (up to 250 personnel to serve in the Corps, and such other personnel as the Secretary may designate from the Department of State and USAID); and (2) a Response Readiness Reserve of personnel to augment the Corps. Amend the Foreign Service Act to authorize the Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Army, to establish a stabilization and reconstruction curriculum for use in programs of the Foreign Service Institute, the National Defense University, and the United States Army War College. Sets forth related personnel provisions."
