    "text": "Consumer Identity Protection and Security Act - Requires a consumer reporting agency to place a security freeze on a private information file when requested to do so by the consumer, subject to waiver by such consumer with respect to limited or temporary access to such file to a particular third party. Identifies federal, state, and local agencies permitted access to such frozen information files. Grants the Federal Trade Commission and specified federal agencies enforcement powers for violations of this Act. Empowers the consumer to file a civil action in any court if a consumer reporting agency violates the requirements of this Act. Prohibits a consumer reporting agency from imposing service fees or charges for implementing the consumer security freeze requests authorized under this Act."
