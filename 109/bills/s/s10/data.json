    "text": "Energy Policy Act of 2005 - Sets forth a program to spur diverse energy research and development, including: (1) energy efficiency; (2) renewable energy; (3) oil and gas; (4) coal; (5) Indian energy; (6) nuclear matters; (7) vehicles and motor fuels; (8) hydrogen; (9) electricity infrastucture; and (10) federal loan guarantees for commercial projects that target energy pollutant reduction. Establishes federal programs that target energy savings in public facilities. Establishes energy assistance programs that include: (1) weatherization assistance; (2) state energy programs; (3) energy efficient appliance rebates; and (4) low income community energy efficiency. Establishes programs for energy efficient products including energy conservation initiatives and energy efficiency in housing. Sets forth renewable energy initiatives that address: (1) renewable energy resources and production; (2) renewable content of motor vehicle fuel; (3) federal agency purchasing requirements for ethanol-blended gasoline and biodiesel fuel; (4) a sugar cane ethanol program; (5) an advanced biofuels technology program; (6) a biomass commercial utilization program; (7) geothermal energy enterprises; and (8) hydroelectric power projects. Sets forth an oil and gas program that includes: (1) the Petroleum Reserve and home heating oil; (2) oil and gas production incentives; (3) oil and gas activities on federal land; (4) a coastal impact assistance program; (5) natural gas enterprises; and (6) federal coalbed methane regulation. Sets forth a Clean Coal Power Initiative campaign that includes grants to universities to establish Centers of Excellence for Energy Systems of the Future.

Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-Determination Act of 2005 - Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to establish the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs to promote Indian tribal energy resource development through a program of grants and loans. Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 2005 - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to modify and extend indemnification authority and liability limits for Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensees and Department of Energy (DOE) contractors. Addresses general nuclear matters, including: (1) extension of indemnification authority; (2) treatment of modular reactors; (3) medical isotope production; (4) safe disposal of greater-than-class-C radioactive waste; (5) a prohibition on nuclear exports to countries that sponsor terrorism; and (5) a DOE decommissioning pilot program. Directs the Secretary of Energy (Secretary) to establish the Next Generation Nuclear Plant Project, a prototype plant that includes a nuclear reactor, to generate electricity and to produce hydrogen. Revises requirements governing: (1) federal agency use of alternative fuels by dual-fueled vehicles; and (2) alternative compliance. Directs the Secretary to establish a cost-shared, public-private research partnership involving the federal government, railroad carriers, locomotive manufacturers and equipment suppliers, and the Association of American Railroads, to develop and demonstrate railroad locomotive technologies that increase fuel economy, reduce emissions, and lower costs of operation. Establishes within the Department of Transportation the Conserve by Bicycling Program. Prescribes guidelines for the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to review reduction of engine idling of heavy-duty vehicles. Directs the Secretary to initiate a project, in partnership with diesel engine, diesel fuel injection system, and diesel vehicle manufacturers and diesel and biodiesel fuel providers, to provide biodiesel testing in advanced diesel engine and fuel system technology. Sets forth a program of federal and state procurement of fuel cell vehicles and hydrogen energy systems. Revamps the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 to create a statutory framework to: (1) promote development and commercialization of hydrogen and fuel cell technology in partnership with industry; (2) establish the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technical Task Force; (3) direct the Secretary to provide for the transfer of critical hydrogen and fuel cell technologies to the private sector; and (4) create a hydrogen supply and fuel cell demonstration program. Energy Research, Development, Demonstration, and Commercial Application Act of 2005 - Prohibits appropriations authorized in this Act for energy efficiency research and development from being used for: (1) issuance or implementation of energy efficiency regulations; (2) the weatherization program established under the Energy Conservation and Production Act (ECPA); (3) a state energy conservation plan established under ECPA; or (4) a federal energy management measure implemented under the National Energy Conservation Policy Act. Directs the Secretary to implement initiatives that target research, development, and commercial application in: (1) energy efficiency; (2) distributed energy and electric energy systems; (3) renewable energy; (4) nuclear energy; (5) fossil energy; (6) science; and (8) international cooperation within the Western Hemisphere and with Israel. Sets forth guidelines governing DOE management, including creation of: (1) a national energy research and development advisory boards; (2) a Technology Transfer Working Group; and (3) a Technology Infrastructure Program. Prescribes guidelines for recruitment and training of skilled technical personnel in energy technology industries and educational programs in science and mathematics. Electricity Modernization Act of 2005 - Amends the Federal Power Act to grant Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulatory jurisdiction over an Electric Reliability Organization. Prescribes guidelines for electric reliability standards, including electric transmission infrastructure, operation and transmission rates. Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to: (1) require electric utilities to make net metering and smart metering available upon consumer request; and (2) terminate mandatory purchase and sale requirements pertaining to cogeneration and small power production utilities. Amends the Federal Power Act to: (1) direct FERC to promulgate market transparency rules governing sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce, and transmission services in interstate commerce; and (2) prohibit energy market manipulation. Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 - Repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935."
