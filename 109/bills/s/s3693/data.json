(Sec. 2) Extends the authorization of appropriations for sex offender management programs through FY2011. Amends federal criminal code provisions relating to domestic violence and stalking to modify the definition of \"spouse or intimate partner.\" Eliminates provisions of the Act relating to training, technical assistance, and data collection for violence against women \"STOP\" grants and grants to encourage arrest.

Extends to three years the compliance period for making forensic medical exams available to victims of sexual assault.

(Sec. 4) Modifies: (1) grant purpose provisions relating to violent crimes on campuses; and (2) grantee reporting requirements to require annual rather than biennial reports on programs to combat such crime.

Amends the Housing Act of 1937 to: (1) prohibit the denial of assisted housing benefits to individuals who are victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking; and (2) allow the eviction of assisted housing tenants who engage in criminal acts of domestic violence against family members or others. (Sec. 6) Amends the Immigration and Naturalization Act to modify provisions relating to admissibility, waivers, removal, and adjustment of status for Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) self-petitioners. Allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive inadmissibility for a VAWA self-petitioner if there is a connection between the alien's battering or subjection to extreme cruelty and the alien's removal, departure from the United States, or reentry or reentries into the United States. (Sec. 7) Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (OCCSSA) to: (1) modify grant allocations to Indian tribal governments for programs to combat violence against women and to encourage arrests and enforce protection orders; and (2) authorize the Attorney General to make grants to such governments for free (or minimal cost) legal assistance to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, or sexual assault who are seeking legal relief. Amends the Safe Homes for Women Act of 1994, the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, and the Violence Against Women Act of 2000 to modify grant allocations for specified programs to combat violence against Indian tribal women.

Repeals provisions of the Act relating to state grants and reporting requirements under OCCSSA.
