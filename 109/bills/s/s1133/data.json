    "text": "Clean Coal Research, Development, Demonstration, and Deployment Act of 2005 - Instructs the Secretary of Energy to establish a clean coal power initiative to provide assistance to specified projects that: (1) operate within the United States with U.S. coal; and (2) advance efficiency, reliability, environmental performance, and cost competitiveness, or develop alternative technology pathways beyond the levels of technologies that are either currently in commercial service, or have demonstrated that commercial service is viable. Directs the Secretary to conduct a program of technology research, development, demonstration, and commercial application for coal and power systems. Sets forth a program to provide federal financial: (1) assistance for projects that will use integrated gasification combined cycle or other advanced coal-based generation technologies; and (2) incentives for deployment of advanced coal-based generation technologies. Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to designate certified coal property as entitled to the energy investment tax credit. Allows a credit against tax for holders of clean energy bonds. Instructs the Secretary to: (1) establish an industrial gasification technology research, development, and demonstration program; (2) establish an Office of Industrial Gasification Coordination; and (3) identify cost and performance goals of industrial gasification technologies whose deployment would permit the continued cost-competitive gasification of certain fuels to produce chemical feedstocks or ammonia-based fertilizers and liquid transportation fuels. Directs the Secretary to establish a competitive program to consider and award certifications for investment and production tax credits to industrial gasification project sponsors. Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow: (1) a synthesis gas production tax credit for production from certified industrial gasification projects; and (2) an investment tax credit for property involved in such projects."
