Increases yearly maximum grant amounts and revises requirements for the allowance of two Pell grants during a single award year. Requires the Secretary to publish annually in the Federal Register a revised table of income protection allowances. Excludes the earned income tax credit (EITC) from financial aid determinations. Authorizes the Secretary to select institutions of higher education for a Nontraditional Students Demonstration Program to test the effectiveness of providing expanded financial assistance to less than half-time students and students in compressed, modular, or other alternative schedules. Directs the Secretary to award competitive grants to eligible institutions to improve remedial education. Increases minimum grant amounts for the Federal TRIO programs. Permits student support services and educational opportunity centers to include career and academic (as well as personal) counseling. Makes awards under the Early Intervention and College Awareness Program for six years. Revises requirements for and reauthorizes the Program. Reauthorizes the Child Care Access Means Parents in School Program of campus-based child care services for low-income parents in postsecondary education. Directs the Secretary to establish a website and brochures for providing outreach about financial aid and education tax credits that targets employers, one-stop centers, Head Start centers, and other appropriate locations. Increases the activities for which grants to Hispanic-serving institutions, as well as grants from the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education, may be used. Revises requirements for Special Programs for Students Whose Families Are Engaged in Migrant and Seasonal Farmwork. Reauthorizes the high school equivalency and the college assistance migrant programs. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the percentage Lifetime Learning income tax credit for qualified higher education expenses, but reduce the maximum annual dollar amount.
