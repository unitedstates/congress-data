    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "2005-09-28", 
    "text": "Relief to Victims of Hurricane Katrina and Other Natural Disasters Act - Amends federal bankruptcy law governing cases commenced as of October 17, 2005 (the effective date of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005). Excludes from the accounting of current monthly income those payments made to victims of a natural disaster by a governmental unit, or by a qualified religious or charitable entity or organization, solely on account of their status as victims of such natural disaster. Defines \"victim of a natural disaster\" as one whose financial condition is materially adversely affected by a natural disaster due to: (1) damage sustained to the principal residence as a result of such disaster; (2) an inability to remain at such principal residence; or (3) an inability to work at the principal place of employment of that person, as a result of such disaster. Permits debtor status for a debtor unable to complete credit counseling because of a natural disaster. Modifies requirements governing the statutory deadline for completion of debtors' duties. Authorizes the court to extend any such time period if: (1) the debtor is a victim of a natural disaster; and (2) the debtor's status as a victim of a natural disaster necessitates such extension of time. Includes within the permissible monthly expenses of a chapter 7 debtor the actual reasonably necessary expenses incurred as a result of being a victim of a natural disaster if the debtor provides the requisite documentation. Modifies requirements governing conversion or dismissal of either a Chapter 7 Liquidation case, a Chapter 11 Reorganization case, or Chapter 13 Regular Income case, where the debtor is a victim of a natural disaster. Authorizes the court to grant an extension of time for filing small business bankruptcy documentation if the debtor's inability to meet the statutory deadline is warranted by a natural disaster. Amends the federal judicial code to authorize an alternative venue if the debtor is not able to reside in the requisite district due to the natural disaster."
