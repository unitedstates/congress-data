Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to award social security credits to parents who stay at home, instead of working outside the home, to care for children who are either under age six or under age 10 and disabled. Authorizes transfers from the general fund to specified Social Security trust funds to cover the cost of such credits."
