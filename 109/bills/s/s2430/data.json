Requires the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Proposal Review Committee to operate under the guidance of FWS (currently, under the guidance of the Council of Lake Committees of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission) and revises Committee membership requirements. Requires the Committee to meet annually. (Sec. 5) Revises the goals of FWS programs related to the Great Lakes fish and wildlife resources to include restoring and maintaining self-sustaining fish and wildlife resources. (Sec. 6) Requires the Great Lakes Coordination Office to: (1) ensure that information acquired under such Act is made available to the public; and (2) report to the FWS Director of Region Three, Great Lakes Big Rivers. Includes within the responsibilities of the Lower Great Lakes Fishery Resources Office and the Upper Great Lakes Fishery Resources Offices FWS operational activities related to fishery resource protection, restoration, maintenance, and enhancement in the offices' respective regions. (Sec. 7) Requires the Director to: (1) submit a report to Congress no later than December 31, 2011, that describes actions taken to solicit and review proposals, the results of the implemented proposals, and progress toward the accomplishment of the Act's goals; (2) make available through a public website of the Department information concerning the proposals, progress, proposed funding priorities, and actions taken in support of the recommendations of the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration for FY2007-FY2012; and (3) submit to Congress no later than June 30, 2007, the 2002 report required under the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act of 1990. (Sec. 8) Requires the Director to continue to monitor the status and the assessment, management, and restoration needs of the Great Lakes Basin's fish and wildlife resources. Authorizes the Director to reassess and update the findings and recommendations of the Great Lakes Fishery Resources Restoration Study.
