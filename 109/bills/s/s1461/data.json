Grants the Federal Trade Commission and specified federal agencies enforcement powers for violations of this Act. Empowers the consumer to file a civil action in any court if a consumer reporting agency violates the requirements of this Act. Prohibits a consumer reporting agency from imposing service fees or charges for implementing the consumer security freeze requests authorized under this Act."
