    "text": "Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to deny any force or effect to any portion of a rule promulgated on April 23, 2004, that has the effect of exempting from FLSA overtime compensation requirements (which limit maximum hours at regular compensation) any employee who would not otherwise be exempted if regulations in effect on March 31, 2003, remained in effect. Reinstates that portion of such regulations that would prevent such an employee from being exempt. Directs the Secretary of Labor to increase, in a specified manner, the minimum salary level for the exemption for executive, administrative, and managerial occupations from FLSA overtime compensation requirements. Amends the FLSA to increase the Federal minimum wage to: (1) $5.85 an hour, beginning on the 60th day after enactment of this Act; (2) $6.55 an hour, beginning 12 months after that 60th day; and (3) $7.25 an hour, beginning 24 months after that 60th day. Expresses the sense of the Senate regarding multiemployer pension plans."
