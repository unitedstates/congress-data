    "text": "Tsunami Preparedness Act - (Sec. 2) Sets forth the purposes of this Act, including improvement of tsunami detection, forecast, warnings, notification, preparedness, and mitigation in order to protect life and property both in the United States and elsewhere in the world. (Sec. 3) Directs the Administrator of the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to operate regional tsunami detection and warning systems for the Pacific Ocean region and for the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico regions that will provide maximum detection capability for U.S. coastal tsunamis. Requires the Administrator to establish tsunami warning centers to provide a link between the detection and warning system and the tsunami hazard mitigation program established under this Act. Directs the Administrator to maintain national and regionally-based data management systems to support and establish data management requirements for the tsunami detection and monitoring system. (Sec. 4) Directs the Administrator to develop and conduct a community-based tsunami hazard mitigation program to improve tsunami preparedness of at-risk areas. (Sec. 5) Directs the Administrator to establish a tsunami research program to develop detection, prediction, communication, and mitigation science and technology that supports tsunami forecasts and warnings, including advanced sensing techniques, information and communication technology, data collection, analysis and assessment for tsunami tracking and numerical forecast modeling that will, among other things, help determine the likely path, severity, duration, and travel time of a tsunami. Requires the Administrator to investigate the potential for improved technology for tsunami and other hazard warnings by incorporating into the existing system a full range of options for providing such warnings to the public. Requires the Administrator to investigate the potential for improved communications systems for tsunami and other hazard warnings by incorporating into the existing network a full range of options for providing those warnings to the public, including telephones, the Internet, automatic alert televisions and radios, and other technologies that may be developed. (Sec. 6) Directs the Administrator to take certain actions to upgrade and modernize the U.S. tsunami detection and warning system. Requires the Administrator to report annually to Congress on the status of the tsunami detection and warning system, as well as progress and accomplishments of the national tsunami hazard mitigation program. (Sec. 7) Directs the Administrator to provide technical assistance and advice to the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO, the World Meteorological Organization, the Group on Earth Observations, and other international entities as part of an international effort to develop a fully functional global tsunami warning system comprised of regional tsunami warning networks. Requires the Administrator to seek funding assistance from participating nations to ensure establishment of such warning system. Requires the Administrator to operate an International Tsunami Information Center to improve tsunami preparedness for all Pacific Ocean nations participating in the International Tsunami Warning System of the Pacific, and which may also provide such assistance to other nations participating in a global tsunami warning system established through the International Oceanographic Committee of UNESCO. (Sec. 8) Directs the Administrator to establish an integrated coastal vulnerability and adaptation program focused on improving the resilience of coastal communities to natural hazards and disasters. Requires the Administrator to establish three regional pilot projects to assess the vulnerability of U.S. coastal areas to hazards associated with tsunami and other natural hazards or coastal disasters. Directs the Administrator to submit to Congress regional adaptation plans based on the information contained in the regional assessments that recommend appropriate targets and strategies. (Sec. 9) Authorizes appropriations for FY2006-FY2012."
