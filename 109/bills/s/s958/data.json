Requires the Trail to be administered by the Secretary of the Interior. Prohibits any land or interest in land outside the exterior boundaries of any federally administered area from being acquired by the United States for the Trail except with the consent of the owner of such land or interest. Instructs the Secretary to: (1) encourage communities, landowners along the Trail, and volunteer trail groups to participate in the planning, development, and maintenance of the Trail; and (2) consult with other affected landowners and federal, state, and local agencies in the administration of the Trail. Allows the Secretary to provide to state and local governments and nonprofit organizations interpretive programs and services and, through Fort McHenry National Monument and Shrine, technical assistance, for use in carrying out preservation and development of, and education relating to the War of 1812 along, the Trail."
