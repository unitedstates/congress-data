Permits mutual or cooperative telephone companies to elect to reduce their unrelated business taxable income in any year by the amount of their qualified broadband expenditures. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) designate census tracts identifying rural and underserved areas under this Act; and (2) prescribe regulations for carrying out the purposes of this Act. Prohibits federal or state agencies from adopting regulations and ratemaking procedures that would eliminate or reduce the broadband expense deduction provided by this Act."
