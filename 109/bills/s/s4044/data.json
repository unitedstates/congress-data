Removes charitable contributions from the statutory formula used to determine what portion of such contributions is reasonably necessary to be expended for such purposes from a debtor's current monthly income. (Thus allows full deduction of such contributions from current monthly income to arrive at disposable income, consistent with the requirements of the Religious Liberty and Charitable Contribution Protection Act of 1998.)"
