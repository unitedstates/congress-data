Requires the Office's Director to: (1) be responsible for developing mechanisms, legal frameworks, and strategic priorities for international cooperative activity in support of homeland security research; (2) facilitate the matching of U.S. and foreign entities engaged in homeland security research so that they may partner in research activities; (3) ensure that the activities are coordinated with those of other relevant research agencies; and (4) hold periodic international homeland security technology workshops and conferences to improve contact among the international community of technology developers and help establish direction for future technology goals. Requires the Director to ensure that funding and resources expended in international cooperative activity will be equitably matched by the foreign partner government or other entity through direct funding, the funding of complementary activities, or the provision of staff, facilities, material, or equipment. Authorizes the Director to require a grant recipient to: (1) match up to 50% of the cost of the proposed project; and (2) repay the grant amount (or a portion thereof), interest, and charges for grant administration. Includes among partners Israel, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Singapore, and other allies in the global war on terrorism. Authorizes appropriations."
