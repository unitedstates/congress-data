    "text": "Spectrum Availability for Emergency-Response and Law-Enforcement to Improve Vital Emergency Services Act or SAVE LIVES Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to extend through December 31, 2008 (currently, 2006) the termination date for television broadcast licenses that authorize analog television service. Repeals provisions authorizing analog service extensions in limited circumstances. Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to take specified actions within specified deadlines for the final television channel assignment of full-power broadcast television stations authorized for digital service. Provides deadlines for the auction of recovered analog spectrum to be used for providing public emergency services. Directs the FCC to distribute to eligible persons analog-to-digital signal converter devices. Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a grant program to provide enhanced interoperability of communications equipment for first responders. Provides certain consumer education requirements regarding the transition to digital television service. Authorizes, with a sunset, temporary digital-to-analog signal conversion for certain cable television subscribers. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow tax credits for qualified electronic waste (television display screens) collected from consumers and recycled. Directs the: (1) Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to study establishing a nationwide recycling program for electronic waste; and (2) FCC to complete certain pending proceedings relating to conversion to digital television and related matters."
