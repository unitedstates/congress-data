Amends the IRC and the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 to extend to all governmental plans the prohibition against (moratorium on) application to State and local plans of certain nondiscrimination rules (requiring that the plan satisfy minimum participation standards and not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees). Subjects tribal governments to the same defined benefit plan rules and regulations applied to State and other local governments, their police and firefighters."
