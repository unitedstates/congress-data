Expresses the sense of Congress in support of the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative and the 2003 and 2004 G-8 agreements. Amends the International Development Association Act to authorize the contribution of specified sums on behalf of the United States to the fourteenth replenishment of the International Development Association. Amends the African Development Fund Act to authorize the contribution of specified sums on behalf of the United States to the tenth replenishment of the Fund.
