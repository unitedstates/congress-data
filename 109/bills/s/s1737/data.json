Amends the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 to direct the President to prohibit the United States or any U.S. entity from purchasing nuclear fuel assemblies (not including low-enriched uranium) from any person or government or affiliated entity that sells nuclear fuel assemblies to Iran. Authorizes the President, with congressional notification, to waive such prohibition for national security purposes."
