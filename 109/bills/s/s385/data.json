Revises limitation provisions for marketing loan gains, loan deficiency payments, and commodity certificate transactions, and establishes an annual combined limitation of $75,000 for such payments. Doubles payment limitations for single farming operations. Limits an individual to a combined annual payment of $250,000. Makes a person who commits fraud in connection with a scheme or device to evade certain program limitations (multiple entities, citizenship) ineligible for farm benefits for six years."
