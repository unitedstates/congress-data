    "text": "Rebuild with Respect Act - Sets forth employment requirements for workers and businesses during the response to Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita (Gulf hurricanes).Reinstates the application of the prevailing wage requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act to all federal contracts in connection with Gulf hurricanes reconstruction efforts in the localities involved, notwithstanding the President's proclamation dated September 8, 2005, or any other provision of law. Reinstates the application of affirmative action requirements to all federal contracts to provide Gulf hurricanes relief, notwithstanding a specified Department of Labor memorandum. Prohibits the heads of federal executive agencies from awarding contracts or grants to procure disaster relief property or services in connection with Gulf hurricanes reconstruction efforts unless the contractors, subcontractors, and grant recipients employ workers affected by Gulf hurricanes as at least 50 percent of the workforce to provide such property or perform such services. Provides for a preference in the award of such contract for organizations, firms, or individuals residing or doing business primarily in an area affected by Gulf hurricanes. Extends the duration of disaster unemployment assistance benefits to up to 52 weeks for eligible workers based on the Gulf hurricanes disasters. Provides for eligible workers in qualified states an increased benefit amount of regular unemployment compensation and emergency extended unemployment compensation. Establishes programs of medical monitoring for individuals working or living in areas affected by Gulf hurricanes. Directs the Secretary of Labor to carry out specified occupational safety and health activities for workers in such areas."
