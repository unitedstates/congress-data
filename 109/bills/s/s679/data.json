Requires the Registry to include certain tax-related information for each contractor, including their taxpayer identification numbers and authorization for the Secretary of Defense to obtain verification of such numbers from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Makes contractors who do not register such information, or who register invalid information, ineligible for contracts entered into under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949."
