Authorizes the Secretary to designate insect-emergency areas. Authorizes grants to: (1) at-risk communities in the Rocky Mountain region to assist such communities in preparing or revising a community wildfire protection plan; and (2) owners or operators of facilities that use biomass to offset their costs of purchasing biomass. Requires the Secretary to establish at least one collection point for the placement of vegetative material removed from federal or other land as part of a hazardous fuel reduction project."
