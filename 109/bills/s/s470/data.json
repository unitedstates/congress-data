Requires the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to make available to the public: (1) the full reviews conducted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of new or supplemental new drug applications; and (2) copies of written consultations on a drug's safety conducted by the Office of Drug Safety. Requires the Secretary to assess civil monetary penalties for failure to comply with the reporting requirements of this Act. Allows the Secretary to correct any information included in the registry or database that is factually and substantively inaccurate, false, or misleading. Extends requirements of this Act to clinical trials conducted outside of the United States under certain circumstances. Prohibits a responsible person or a manufacturer from performing any act that prohibits, limits, or imposes unreasonable delays on the ability of an individual to discuss or publish the results of a clinical trial. Requires the Secretary to enter into a contract with the Institute of Medicine to study the extent to which data submitted to the registry has impacted the public health."
