Directs the Secretaries to: (1) adopt a nationwide policy for governing backcountry aviation issues related to the management of federal land under their jurisdiction; and (2) require regional managers to adhere to it. Declares that a policy affecting air access to an aircraft landing strip located on federal land will not take effect unless certain conditions are met."
