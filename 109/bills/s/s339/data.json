Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to: (1) limit the applicability or effect of any Federal law related to the protection or management of fish or wildlife or to the regulation of commerce; (2) limit the authority of the United States to prohibit hunting or fishing on U.S. lands; or (3) abrogate, abridge, affect, modify, supersede, or alter any treaty-reserved or other right of any Indian tribe as recognized by any other means."
