    "text": "United States Trade Rights Enforcement Act - Expresses the sense of Congress about making the countervailing duty law under the Tariff Act of 1930 applicable to actions by nonmarket economy countries, and the impact on the U.S. economy of the huge growth in trade with the People's Republic of China (PRC). Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to impose countervailing duties on certain merchandise from nonmarket economy countries. Suspends for three years the requirement that the administering authority direct the Customs Service to allow, at the option of the importer of such merchandise, the posting, until completion of the review, of a bond or security in lieu of a cash deposit for each entry of the subject merchandise (bonding privileges). Requires the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) and the Secretary of Commerce to ensure that specified steps are taken by the PRC to ensure its compliance with its international trade obligations regarding: (1) intellectual property rights; (2) access for exports of U.S. goods, services, and agriculture; and (3) a required detailed accounting of its subsidies to the World Trade Organization (WTO) by the end of 2005. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report to specified congressional committees on: (1) the definition of currency manipulation; (2) actions of foreign countries that will be considered to be such; and (3) how statutory provisions addressing it by U.S. trading partners contained in, and relating to, the Bretton Woods Agreements Act and the Exchange Rates and International Economic Policy Coordination Act of 1988 can be better clarified administratively to provide for improved and more predictable evaluation. Authorizes appropriations for the Office of the USTR and for the U.S. International Trade Commission. Requires the Commission to study and report on trade and economic relations between the United States and the PRC. Expresses the sense of Congress that the: (1) United States should strive to expand membership in the Agreement on Government Procurement of the WTO; (2) United States should ensure that the PRC meets its WTO obligations; (3) the United States should seek a commitment from the PRC to maintain its suspension of the implementation of its law on government procurement, pending the conclusion of negotiations to accede to the Agreement; (4) the United States should seek commitments from the PRC and other countries that are not yet members of the Agreement to implement the principles of openness, transparency, fair competition based on merit, nondiscrimination, and accountability in their government procurement as embodied in that Agreement; and (5) the President should direct all appropriate U.S. officials to raise these concerns with appropriate PRC officials and other trading partners."
