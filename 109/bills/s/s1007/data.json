Provides that the FMAP applicable to a State for FY2006 after the application of the above limitation on reduction shall apply only for purposes of titles XIX (Medicaid) and XXI (State Children's Health Insurance (SCHIP)) of the Social Security Act and payments under such titles that are based on a certain enhanced FMAP, and shall not apply with respect to payments under title IV (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)) of the Social Security Act. Repeals this Act effective as of October 1, 2006, and provides that it shall not apply to any fiscal year after FY2006."
