Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review and amend federal sentencing guidelines to: (1) reflect changes to mandatory minimum sentences made by this Act; (2) provide increased sentences for defendants who use violence or weapons in the course of a drug trafficking offense or who play an active role in the commission of such offenses; and (3) limit sentencing for defendants who play a lesser role in the commission of drug offenses and who receive little or no compensation from their crime. Requires the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to carry out a pilot program for home detention of nonviolent prisoners age 65 or older."
