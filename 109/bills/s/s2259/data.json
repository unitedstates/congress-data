Grants the Commission authority to: (1) investigate lobbying disclosures filed with the Senate and the House of Representatives; (2) investigate Senate members and staff who violate restrictions on interactions with lobbyists; (3) conduct research concerning governmental ethics and implement any public educational programs it considers necessary to give effect to this Act; and (4) report annually to the Senate Select Committee on Ethics and the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct (ethics committees). Declares that investigation by the Commission shall be in lieu of the preliminary ethics investigation required for such ethics committees. Prohibits such committees from conducting preliminary investigations upon the Commission's establishment. Authorizes the Commission, upon a majority vote, to refer a case with evidence to the appropriate ethics committee. Authorizes the Office of Public Integrity, upon a majority vote of the Commission, to refer potential legal violations to the Department of Justice for civil enforcement. Subjects to fines, costs of the preliminary review, and penalties individuals who: (1) file false complaints with the Commission about alleged misconduct on the part of any legislator or other person; or (2) encourage another individual to do so."
