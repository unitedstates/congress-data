(Current law prohibits any successor entity or separated entity from having officers or managers who are officers or managers of any signatories or former signatories or who have any direct financial interest in or financial relationship to any signatories or former signatories, except that such interest may be managed through a blind trust or similar mechanism.) Strikes provsions that prohibited a separated entity from having officers or directors, who are either officers or managers of any intergovernmental organization or who have any direct financial interest in or financial relationship to any international organization, except that such interest may be managed through a blind trust or similar mechanism. Requires the United States to preserve the space segment capacity of the GMDSS (Global Maritime Distress and Safety System).
