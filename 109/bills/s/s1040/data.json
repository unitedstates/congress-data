    "text": "Credit Card Minimum Payment Notification Act - Amends the Truth in Lending Act regarding disclosures required with each billing cycle under an open end consumer credit plan to require a credit card issuer to include in specified type a written statement in the following form: \"Minimum Payment Warning: Making only the minimum payment will increase the interest you pay and the time it takes to repay your balance.\" Prescribes additional three-line statements disclosing the length of time it will take to pay off balances and the final cost to the consumer of interest rates charged. Requires disclosure of a toll-free telephone number to obtain an estimate in person rather than a recording of the time to repay the balance making only minimum payments and the total amount of those payments. Directs the Federal Trade Commission to establish a detailed table illustrating the approximate number of months that it would take and the approximate total cost to repay an outstanding balance if the consumer pays only the required minimum monthly payments and if no other additional charges or fees are incurred on the account. Exempts from such disclosure requirements any billing cycle in which: (1) the account agreement requires a minimum payment of not less than 10% of the outstanding balance; and (2) finance charges are not imposed."
