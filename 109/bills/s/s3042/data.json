    "text": "All-Hazards Public Health Emergency and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) establish guidelines for preparedness grantees to conduct assessments of public health capacities; (2) dispense only 50% of a preparedness grant unless the entity has an approved preparedness and response plan; (3) establish measurable performance standards with respect to basic preparedness for identified public health threats; and (4) study the size and scope of the health care and public health workforces necessary to respond to common public health issues and emergencies. Establishes within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Health to carry out the public health preparedness functions of HHS. Conditions the receipt of grant funds on an entity having a plan for operational continuity in the event of bioterrorism or another public health emergency. Establishes a fund to provide short-term assistance to health care providers and members of the public health workforce in the event of bioterrorism or another public health emergency. Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish the Public Health Workforce Scholarship Program to offer scholarships in return for working at federal, state, local, and tribal public health agencies; (2) establish the Public Health Workforce Loan Repayment Program to provide for the repayment of loans in exchange for working at such agencies; and (3) award grants to public health agencies for workforce loan repayment programs."
