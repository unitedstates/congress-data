Requires the Archivist of the United States to enter into an agreement with an entity outside the National Archives for the establishment of a secondary location for copies of such part of the Collection as considered appropriate.

Sets forth provisions for the: (1) review, identification, transmission to the National Archives, and public disclosure of records related to the life and assassination of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., by Government offices; and (2) postponement of public disclosure of related records or particular information in such records. Establishes the Martin Luther King Records Review Board. Provides for the appointment of an Executive Director to such Board. Sets forth requirements for the review of all assassination and related records for public disclosure or postponement of public disclosure by the Review Board. Grants Presidential authority over such disclosure or postponement of executive branch related records or information, or of any information in a related record obtained or developed solely within the executive branch."
