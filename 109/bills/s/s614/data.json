Allows any Medicare-eligible veteran to elect to be furnished by the Secretary, on an outpatient basis, such drugs and medicines as ordered on prescription of a duly licensed physician as specific therapy for any illness or injury suffered by the veteran. Requires such election to last for a calendar year and to be irrevocable. Allows for election renewal. Requires appropriate information to be furnished to each veteran prior to such election. Authorizes the Secretary to administer immunizations to voluntary eligible veterans in connection with the provision of care in any Department of Veterans Affairs health care facility. Provides for appropriate copayments for the drugs and medicines received by veterans under authority of this Act."
