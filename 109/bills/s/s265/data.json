Removes authorization for the National Clearinghouse on Trauma Care and Emergency Medical Services. Allows the Secretary to make grants to entities to carry out demonstration projects to improve emergency medical services in rural areas by increasing communication and coordination with State trauma systems. Revises the matching requirements for States to be eligible for grants to improve emergency medical services in rural areas. Prohibits the Secretary from making trauma care grants to a State unless the State's emergency medical services plan coordinates planning for trauma systems with State disaster emergency planning and bioterrorism hospital preparedness planning. Requires the Secretary to update the model plan for the designation of trauma centers and for triage, transfer, and transportation policies. Directs the Secretary to enter into a contract with the Institute of Medicine or another appropriate entity to conduct a study on trauma care and trauma systems research."
