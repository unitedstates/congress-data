Requires any institution of higher education that participates in a title IV program to offer an option to reenroll when such service is completed to any student who is enrolled at the time such service begins. Makes eligible, for such deferment and option, members of: (1) the Armed Forces serving in a combat operation or combat zone; or (2) a reserve component of the Armed Forces serving pursuant to a call or order to active duty for a period of more than 30 days."
