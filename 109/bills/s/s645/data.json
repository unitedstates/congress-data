    "text": "Assault Weapons Ban and Law Enforcement Protection Act of 2005 - Amends the Federal criminal code to reinstate the Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act's assault weapons ban to prohibit: (1) the manufacture, transfer, or possession of a semiautomatic assault weapon; (2) the transfer, possession, or importation of a large capacity ammunition feeding device; (3) the transfer of any assault weapon with such a device. Specifies models and features of banned weapons. Sets forth exceptions to such ban, including: (1) firearms or devices lawfully possessed under Federal law on the date of enactment of this Act; (2) any firearm that is manually operated by bolt, pump, lever, or slide action that has been rendered permanently inoperable or is an antique firearm; and (3) firearms manufactured for, transferred to, or possessed by a Federal, State, or local government agency or for law enforcement. Prohibits: (1) any person from transferring a semiautomatic assault weapon to which the ban does not apply, except through a licensed dealer or a State or local law enforcement agency; or (2) a licensed manufacturer, importer, or dealer who transfers a device manufactured before enactment of this Act to fail to certify such date of manufacture. Requires the serial number of any weapon or device manufactured after the enactment of this Act to clearly show the date of manufacture. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) maintain, submit to Congress, and make publicly available a record of any semiautomatic assault weapon used in relation to a crime; and (2) study and report to Congress on the effects of this Act on violent and drug trafficking crime. Prohibits the transfer of such a weapon or device to a juvenile."
