Requires such redistricting to be conducted through a plan developed by the independent redistricting commission established in the state, or if such plan is not enacted into law, the redistricting plan selected by the state's highest court or developed by a U.S. district court. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) establishment of a state independent redistricting commission; (2) development of a redistricting plan; (3) its submission to the state legislature; (4) selection of a plan, under specified conditions, by the state's highest court or the U.S. district court for the district in which the capital of the state is located; (5) special rules for redistricting conducted under a federal court order; and (6) Election Assistance Commission payments to states for carrying out redistricting."
