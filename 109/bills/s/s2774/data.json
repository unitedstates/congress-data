Requires the agency head, in entering into an agreement for debris removal or demolition services in connection with Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita reconstruction efforts, to give preference in the source selection process to each offeror who certifies that any work that is to be performed under the contract by subcontractors will be performed by local subcontractors."
