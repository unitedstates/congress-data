    "text": "States that specified funds authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of Energy for the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (Colorado) shall be available to the Secretary for the purchase of essential mineral rights at Rocky Flats. Prescribes related conditions under which any natural resource damage liability claim shall be deemed to be satisfied. Exempts mineral rights purchased under this Act from the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Amends the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act of 2001 to repeal the mandate for a Memorandum of Understanding in connection with the transfer to the Secretary of the Interior of management responsibilities and jurisdiction over Rocky Flats. Repeals, also, the prohibiton against any reduction in funds available to the Secretary of Energy for cleanup and closure of Rocky Flats as a result of such transfer. Revises the composition of the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge and excludes specified lands subject to certain essential mineral rights."
