Terminates the Secretary's authority to make such payments if the State of California or local education agencies do not continue to provide funding to the schools in those school districts at per student levels that at least equal to the amount provided in FY2005. Sets forth limitations on the use and amount of such funds, including a maximum limit of $400,000 on payments in any fiscal year. Prohibits the use of funds to make payments under this Act from the following sources: (1) any law authorizing the collection or expenditure of entrance or use fees at units of the National Park System; (2) any unexpended receipts collected through the recreational fee demonstration program or the national park passport program; and (3) emergency appropriations for Yosemite flood recovery. Allows the Secretary to use an authorized funding source to make payments only if the funding available to Yosemite National Park from such source (after subtracting any payments to the school districts) is greater than or equal to the amount made available to the Park for the prior fiscal year, or in FY2005, whichever is greater. (Sec. 102) Amends the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996 to allow certain facilities to be located outside the boundaries of Yosemite National Park. Title II: Rancho Corral De Tierra Golden Gate National Recreation Area Boundary Adjustment - Rancho Corral de Tierra Golden Gate National Recreation Area Boundary Adjustment Act - (Sec. 202) Modifies the boundaries of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in California to include specified additional lands. Allows the Secretary of the Interior to acquire certain of those lands only from a willing seller. Title III: Redwood National Park Boundary Adjustment - Redwood National Park Boundary Adjustment Act of 2005 - (Sec. 302) Revises the boundaries of the Redwood National Park in California. Requires that the map of the revised boundaries be placed on file and be available for public inspection in offices of the National Park Service and that such map be provided by the Secretary of the Interior to officers of Del Norte and Humboldt Counties, California. Increases to 133,000 acres the maximum acreage of the Park."
