Prohibits the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from relicensing the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station until it has considered a report to Congress by the National Academy of Sciences that provides: (1) an independent assessment of safety performance; and (2) recommendations whether the Station should be relicensed and the conditions for such relicensing."
