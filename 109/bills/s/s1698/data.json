Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) enter into negotiations with the World Bank, the International Development Association, Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations, and other interested parties to establish advanced market commitments to purchase such vaccines and microbicides; and (2) establish in the Treasury the Lifesaving Vaccine Purchase Fund. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish business credits for: (1) vaccine research related to HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, or certain infectious diseases afflicting developing countries; and (2) certain sales of lifesaving vaccines to nonprofit organizations, or to foreign governments or instrumentalities for distribution in developing countries. Amends the Small Business Act to: (1) direct the Small Business Administration (SBA) to establish a four-year pilot program to encourage the development of such vaccines and microbicides, including program outreach activities; and (2) provide Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) funding for such vaccines and microbicides."
