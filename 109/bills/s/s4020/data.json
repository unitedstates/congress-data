    "text": "Renewable Fuels Promotion Act - Amends the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act to prohibit a franchisor from restricting a franchisee from: (1) installing a renewable fuel pump on the franchisee marketing premises; (2) converting an existing tank and pump on the marketing premises of the franchisee for renewable fuel use; (3) advertising the sale of renewable fuel; or (4) selling renewable fuel in any specified area on the franchisee marketing premises. Declares any such restriction to be null and void and unenforceable under the Act. Prohibits a franchise-related document that requires the franchisee to sell three grades of gasoline from preventing the franchisee from selling a renewable fuel in lieu of one grade of gasoline. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to set a deadline for mandatory installation of at least one renewable fuel pump at every federal fleet fueling center in the United States."
