Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) allow employers a business tax credit for 50 percent of the actual compensation paid to Ready Reserve-National Guard employees while on active duty or hospitalized incident to such duty; (2) allow employers a tax credit for wages paid to temporary employees hired to replace Ready Reserve-National Guard employees while on active duty; (3) provide for withholding of tax on differential wage payments to active duty members of the uniformed services; and (4) treat such differential wage payments as employee compensation for retirement plan purposes, including for the deductibility of contributions to individual retirement accounts."
