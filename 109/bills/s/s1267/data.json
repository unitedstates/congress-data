Revises fund allocation to provide, under certain conditions, for formula grants to states and competitive grants to partnerships. Requires partnerships, through a cohort approach, to provide activities designed to ensure: (1) secondary school completion and college enrollment of students at risk of dropping out; and (2) systemic changes in schools, so future cohorts of children will benefit. Requires such activities to include: (1) enrollment in college preparation curricula; (2) professional development for college preparation course instructors; and (3) curriculum development. Requires states to provide: (1) policy leadership to promote college readiness of students, especially those at risk of dropping out and those who are economically disadvantaged; and (2) services to promote coordination and information sharing among grantees. Eliminates authority for a scholarship program component and for 21st Century Scholar Certificates."
