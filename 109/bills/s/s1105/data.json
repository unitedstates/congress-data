Revises VI-C to authorize the IIPP to provide summer stipends and Ralph Bunche scholarships for needy students to participate in IIPP programs. Authorizes: (1) waiver of an eligible recipient's match requirement for a professional development program; (2) broader institutional development; (3) advanced degrees in international relations; and (4) biennial reports."
