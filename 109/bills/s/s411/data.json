Requires the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MEDPAC) to develop recommendations on policies and practices that would encourage: (1) healthy outcomes and quality care under the Medicare program in States with respect to which payments are reduced under such system; and (2) the efficient use of payments made under the Medicare program in such States."
