Adds specific conditions for reducing the price used to establish export price or \"constructed export price,\" meaning the amount at which the merchandise is first sold or agreed to be sold in the United States by or for the producer or exporter. Applies this Act to Canada and Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act."
