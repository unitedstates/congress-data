    "text": "Secret Service Authorization and Technical Modification Act of 2005 - Amends the federal criminal code to revise prohibitions on entering or remaining in areas the President or other person protected by the Secret Service is visiting. Prohibits willfully and knowingly entering or remaining in such an area that is restricted in conjunction with a special event of national significance, with intent to impede or disrupt business or access or to engage in violence. (Repeals provisions: (1) prohibiting willfully and knowingly entering or remaining, with such intent, in facilities designated by the Secretary of the Treasury as temporary residences and offices of the President, his staff, and other persons protected by the Secret Service; and (2) authorizing the Secretary to make such designations.) Specifies penalties for violations. Revises prohibitions involving false or fraudulent identification documents to cover false documents that appear to represent a sponsoring entity of a special event of national significance. Modifies the duties of the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division to include protection of: (1) any officer next in the order of succession to the Office of President after the Vice President, the President-elect, the Vice President-elect, and their immediate families; (2) former Presidents and their spouses; (3) a special event of national significance; (4) major presidential and vice presidential candidates and, within 120 days of the general presidential election, their spouses; and (5) visiting heads of foreign states or foreign governments. Specifies the authority of members of the Division to carry firearms and to make arrests without warrants for certain offenses. Authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to carry out functions related to the protection of foreign diplomatic missions located in metropolitan areas (other than the District of Columbia) where 20 or more such missions are located, and visits of foreign government officials to such areas, by contract or by using the services, personnel, equipment, and facilities of state and local governments on a reimbursable basis. Requires the Secret Service to be maintained as a distinct entity within the Department of Homeland Security with its members reporting only to its Director."
