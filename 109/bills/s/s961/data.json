    "text": "Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Reform Act of 2005 - Amends the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 to repeal the authorization for use of certain moneys in the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund: (1) by the Secretary of Agriculture for reclamation of rural lands; and (2) by the Department of the Interior for certain studies, research, and demonstration projects. Extends the authority to collect reclamation fees to 2019. Revises Fund allocation requirements with respect to such fees. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer specified sums to: (1) the United Mine Workers of America Combined Benefit Fund; (2) the United Mine Workers of America 1992 Benefit Plan; and (3) a certain multiemployer health benefit plan established after July 20, 1992, by the parties that are the settlors of the 1992 Plan. Repeals Fund objectives concerning: (1) protection , construction, or enhancement of public facilities such as utilities, roads, recreation and conservation facilities adversely affected by coal mining practices; and (2) the development of publicly owned land adversely affected by coal mining practices, including land acquired as provided for recreation and historic purposes, conservation, and reclamation purposes and open space benefits. States that no lien shall be filed against any person who neither consented to, nor participated in, nor exercised control over the mining operation which necessitated reclamation. Repeals the limitation of such prohibition to persons who owned the surface before May 2, 1977. Modifies guidelines for certification of completion of coal reclamation."
