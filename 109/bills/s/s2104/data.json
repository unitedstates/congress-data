Requires the Director of NIH to commission the Institute of Medicine to study the rules that protect patient safety and anonymity with respect to clinical research. Establishes an Office of Bioscientific Enterprise Development (OBED) and transfers to it the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs. Requires OBED to partner grantees with potential purchasers of products. Establishes an Office of Technology Transfer (OTT) and transfers to it appropriate NIH functions. Requires OTT to establish: (1) an Office of Rapid Access to Intervention Development to accelerate the process from laboratory to clinic; and (2) a program that cultivates industry interest in NIH-funded research. Establishes an Office of Intramural Risk Opportunity and Mapping to oversee the intramural research programs of NIH.
