Defines \"qualified electronic waste\" as any discarded computer display screen or system unit. Bans the disposal of electronic waste without recycling three years after the enactment of this Act. Requires the head of each Federal executive agency to recycle electronic waste. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to study the feasibility of establishing a nationwide recycling program for electronic waste that preempts any State recycling program."
