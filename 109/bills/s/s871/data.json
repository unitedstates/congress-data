    "text": "Standing With Our Troops Act of 2005 - Increases authorized end strengths for the Army and Marine Corps. Requires the Secretary of Defense to: (1) publish a monthly accounting of military casualties incurred in Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, and any other operation undertaken under the Global War on Terrorism; and (2) establish within the Department of Defense (DOD) an Advisory Panel on Military Awards and Decorations. Establishes within the National Security Council a Director of Mobilization Planning and Preparedness to identify and develop plans for the performance of necessary governmental and private sector functions on a sustained basis during a national emergency. Requires reports on: (1) necessary reconstitution of military equipment due to Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom; and (2) DOD policies concerning the length of reserve mobilization and deployment periods in connection with Operation Iraqi Freedom. Requires the correction of military pay problems experienced by activated reserve personnel. Establishes a Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (Reserve Affairs). Provides various programs and authorities to afford financial relief to National Guard and reserve personnel activated for overseas warfighting or domestic homeland security missions, including penalty-free early withdrawals from retirement plans, differential wage payments, and the Ready Reserve-National Guard employee tax credit. National Guard and Reserve Comprehensive Health Benefits Act of 2005 - Makes members of the Selected Reserve eligible for TRICARE (a DOD-managed health care program). Allows the continuation of non-TRICARE health benefits coverage for reserves called or ordered to active duty (and their dependents). Increases from $12,000 to $100,000 the death gratuity for survivors of members killed during active duty or inactive duty training. Requires a report on additional needs for funding U.S. military and reconstruction efforts in Iraq."
