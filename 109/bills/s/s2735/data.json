Requires the strategic plan for dam safety prepared by the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to establish performance measures, in addition to goals, priorities, and target dates, toward effectively administering the Act to improve dam safety. Requires a state dam safety program, to be eligible for assistance under such Act, to include: (1) the authority to require or perform periodic evaluations of all dams and reservoirs to the extent of the threat to human life and property in case of failure; and (2) the authority to issue notices to require owners of dams to install and monitor instrumentation.
