Directs that the members of the Corps shall be activated by the declaration of a public health emergency. Allows members of the Corps to be used by qualified entities to carry out activities under a national, state, or local influenza vaccination program or other countermeasure distribution program. Allows the Secretary or a state governor to request assignment of Corps members from a state or territory to participate in a vaccination program or countermeasure distribution program of another state or territory. Requires the Secretary to: (1) develop a National Identification Card that describes the health-related licensure and certification information of Corps members; and (2) award grants for Corps training, recruitment and retention, and capacity building activities. Deems a member of the Corps, when performing duties under an activation and assignment by the Secretary upon a declaration of a public health emergency, to be a federal employee for liability purposes."
