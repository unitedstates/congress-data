Authorizes the President to establish programs in support of greater energy cooperation between the United States and India. Authorizes assistance for cooperation related to research, development, and deployment in selected areas, including: (1) clean coal and emission reduction technologies and carbon sequestration projects; (2) alternative fuel sources, such as ethanol, biomass, and coal-based fuels; (3) energy efficiency projects; (4) research related to commercially available technologies that promote the clean and efficient use of energy in India; and (5) technical assistance in support of the development by the government of India of a strategic oil reserve to allow India to cope with short-term disruptions to global oil supplies without causing shocks to India's market or the global market. Directs the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, to report to certain congressional committees on energy security cooperation between the United States and India."
