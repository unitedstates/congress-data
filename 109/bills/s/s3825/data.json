Authorizes appropriations to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in FY2007-FY2011 to deploy trace chemical detectors for detecting narcotics and explosive devices along the U.S. border. Expresses the sense of Congress that the U.S. Trade Representative should consider ways to curb illicit use and shipment of pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and similar chemicals in any multilateral or bilateral negotiations. Directs the DEA Administrator to establish an exchange program with foreign law enforcement officers from countries that traffic methamphetamine into the United States. Directs the Attorney General to report to Congress on methamphetamine trafficking and abuse on Indian reservations on or near the U.S. border."
