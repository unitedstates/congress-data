Authorizes the Administrator to: (1) impose service fees on users to pay for developing, operating, maintaining, and upgrading the system; and (2) deposit the fees into the Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest System Fund (established by this Act). Requires the Administrator to: (1) establish the Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest System Governing Board; and (2) carry out this Act in each state unless the state program is fully authorized to do so."
