    "text": "Personal Data Privacy and Security Act of 2005 - Amends the federal criminal code to prohibit: (1) intentionally accessing a computer without authorization, thereby obtaining data broker information; (2) concealing security breaches involving personally identifiable information (personal information); and (3) unlawfully accessing another's means of identification during a felony involving computers. Amends the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act to cover fraud in connection with such unauthorized access. Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to amend the sentencing guidelines regarding identity theft. Requires a data broker to: (1) disclose to an individual, upon request, personal electronic records pertaining to such individual maintained for disclosure to third parties; and (2) publish on its website procedures for responding to claims of inaccuracies. Establishes safeguards to protect the privacy and security of personal information applicable to certain business entities, which shall: (1) notify specified parties of security breaches; and (2) offer to cover specified costs for affected U.S. residents. Requires: (1) the Department of Justice to contract with the National Research Council to study securing personal information; (2) the Comptroller General to study social security number uses and federal use of commercial databases; and (3) the Administrator of the General Services Administration to evaluate contractor programs. Prohibits without consent (with exceptions): (1) the display of an individual's social security number to a third party; and (2) the sale or purchase of such number. Amends the Social Security Act to restrict social security number use by businesses and the government. Sets remedies for violations of this Act."
