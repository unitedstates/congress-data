    "text": "Hurricane Katrina Food Assistance Relief Act of 2005 - Amends the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to provide expedited and increased food stamp benefits for households in areas affected by Hurricane Katrina (including areas that were disaster-designated as a result of Hurricane Katrina) or a related condition. Includes as an eligible household a household: (1) in an affected area; (2) in which a member worked in an affected area immediately prior to August 29, 2005; (3) that was displaced as a result of Hurricane Katrina or a related condition to other areas of the same or another state; (4) that the Secretary of Agriculture (the Secretary) determines should receive relief; or (5) containing one or more individuals displaced by Hurricane Katrina or a related condition. Authorizes the Secretary, under expedited procedures, to use specified food stamp program funds in FY2005-FY2006 for contracts with nonprofit organizations to support household and community efforts to address food assistance and related needs resulting from Hurricane Katrina or a related condition. Directs: (1) the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer to the Secretary specified amounts (which shall be available without further appropriation) for food assistance to eligible recipients, including special supplemental foods for pregnant women and infants (WIC) or for other individuals with special needs, infant formula, bottled water, and fruit juices; (2) the Secretary to use additional commodity distribution funds for food assistance to such recipients. Includes as an eligible recipient a person who: (1) is a victim of Hurricane Katrina or a related condition; (2) has been displaced by Hurricane Katrina or a related condition; or (3) is temporarily housing one or more individuals displaced by Hurricane Katrina or a related condition. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer to the Secretary additional WIC and commodity supplemental food program funds (which shall be available without further appropriation) for persons victimized or displaced by Hurricane Katrina or a related condition."
