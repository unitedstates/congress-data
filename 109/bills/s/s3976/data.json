States that it is Congress' intent that this Act be liberally construed so as to effectuate its remedial purpose of giving a full determination on the merits for each denied Pigford claim. Defines: (1) \"Pigford claimant\" as an individual who previously submitted a late-filing request under the consent decree in the case of Pigford v. Glickman (1999); and (2) \"Pigford claim\" as a discrimination complaint as defined and documented by such consent decree."
