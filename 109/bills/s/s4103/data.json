Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to establish a Senior Advisor to the President for the Prevention of Nuclear Terrorism. Requires an annual report from the President to Congress on the security of formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material. States as the policy of the United States that all possible steps be taken as rapidly as possible to ensure that all nuclear weapons and formula quantities of strategic special nuclear materials are secure and accounted for. Directs the President to seek an international agreement on a global standard that implements such policy."
