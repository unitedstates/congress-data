Authorizes the Secretary to contract for: (1) the construction or operation of new refineries; or (2) the acquisition or reopening of closed refineries. Instructs the Secretary to operate the Reserve to provide petroleum products to: (1) the federal government (including the Department of Defense); (2) any state governments and their political subdivisions that opt to purchase refined petroleum products from the Reserve; and (3) the general public during certain emergency periods. Directs the Secretary to ensure that refineries in the Reserve are designed to provide a rapid increase in production capacity during such emergency periods. Requires a refinery owner or operator to notify the Secretary, with an explanation, not later than 180 days before permanently closing a refinery in the United States. Requires the Secretary to report the notification and explanation to Congress, together with an analysis of the effects of the proposed closing."
