Provides that such withdrawals and issuances shall occur without any further adjudication of coal preference right lease applications. Directs the Secretary to establish a panel to determine the fair market value of the coal reserves of any coal preference right applications withdrawn under this Act. Instructs the Secretary to contract with a qualified coal reserve appraiser to assist the panel. Directs the Secretary, after the withdrawal of a coal preference right lease application, to: (1) accept the relinquishment of the rights associated with such application; and (2) issue a certificate of bidding rights in the amount of the fair market value of the coal reserves of such application. Provides that the Secretary's duties in issuing such patents and certificates shall be considered nondiscretionary and enforceable in a mandamus proceeding. Sets forth provisions regarding the use of exchange bidding rights."
