Grants the Secretary instead, in order to ensure that each part D eligible individual who is enrolled under a prescription drug plan or a Medicare Advantage prescription drug plan pays the lowest possible price, authority similar to that of other Federal entities that purchase prescription drugs in bulk to negotiate contracts with manufacturers of covered Medicare part D drugs, consistent with the requirements and in furtherance of the goals of providing quality care and containing costs under such part."
