Directs the Secretary of Transportation to study and report to the appropriate congressional committees on the steps and estimated funding necessary to designate and construct a new interstate route for the 3rd Infantry Division Highway, between Savannah, Georgia, and Knoxville, Tennessee (formerly the Savannah River Parkway in the State of Georgia)."
