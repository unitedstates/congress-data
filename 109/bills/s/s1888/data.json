    "text": "Military Family Support Act of 2005 - Directs the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to establish a program to authorize a caregiver (a federal employee at least 21 years of age capable of providing care to a child or other dependent family member of a member of the Armed Forces) to: (1) use any available sick leave for the provision of such care in the same manner as annual leave is used; and (2) use any federal leave available to that caregiver as though that period of caregiving is a medical emergency. Requires the service member: (1) for whom the caregiving is provided to be performing service in support of a contingency operation or in situations for which hostile fire or imminent danger pay is authorized; and (2) to designate the caregiver for his or her family. Terminates the program on December 31, 2007. Directs the Secretary of Labor to: (1) establish a program to authorize employees of private businesses to use sick or any other leave for caregiving in the same manner as above; and (2) solicit businesses to voluntarily participate in the program. Requires caregiver designation. Terminates the program on December 31, 2007."
