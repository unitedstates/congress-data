    "text": "Stop the Online Exploitation of Our Children Act of 2006 - Amends the federal criminal code to expand the reporting requirements of any online service (as redefined by this Act) with respect to violations of child sexual exploitation and pornography laws. Requires such services to: (1) report any facts or circumstances indicating a violation of federal child sexual exploitation or pornography laws to the CyberTipline of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children; and (2) provide information on the Internet identity and location of any individual who appears to have violated any child sexual exploitation or pornography law. Requires the Center to forward each report which it receives from an online service to an appropriate law enforcement agency. Imposes increased fines on online services for intentional and negligent failures to comply with reporting requirements under this Act. Requires the U.S. Trade Representative, the Attorney General, and other relevant federal officials to encourage foreign governments to combat child pornography. Authorizes appropriations for grants to Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. Amends the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act to require registered sex offenders to disclose and update their e-mail addresses, instant message addresses, and other similar Internet identifiers. Imposes a fine and/or prison term of up to 10 years for failure to provide such information. Increases criminal penalties on sex offenders who use the Internet to violate child pornography laws. Requires online services to remove web pages linked to sex offenders from social networking sites."
