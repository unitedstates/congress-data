Directs the Secretary to prescribe by regulation standards for ensuring the safety and physical integrity of pressurized rail tank cars used to transport extremely hazardous materials. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the safety and security of, and the threat posed by acts of terrorism to, the transportation by rail of extremely hazardous materials. Sets forth whistleblower protections for persons involved in the transportation of extremely hazardous materials. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of this Act."
