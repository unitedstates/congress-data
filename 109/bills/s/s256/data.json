    "as": "Public Law", 
    "date": "2005-04-20", 
    "text": "Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 - Title I: Needs-Based Bankruptcy - (Sec. 101) Amends Federal bankruptcy law to revamp guidelines governing dismissal or conversion of a Chapter 7 liquidation (complete relief in bankruptcy) to one under either Chapter 11 (Reorganization) or Chapter 13 (Adjustment of Debts of an Individual with Regular Income). Permits the bankruptcy court to convert a Chapter 7 case to either Chapter 11 or 13 with a debtor's consent. (Current law requires the debtor's request for such a conversion.) (Sec. 102) Permits the court upon its own motion, or upon the motion of the bankruptcy trustee, bankruptcy administrator, or any party in interest, to move for a dismissal. (Current law prohibits a party in interest from entering such motions.) Lowers the \"substantial abuse\" standard for dismissal or conversion to one of simple abuse. Replaces the presumption in favor of granting the relief sought by the debtor with a presumption that abuse exists if the debtor's current monthly income exceeds an amount determined according to specified formulae. Prohibits inclusion of any payments for debts within the statutory calculation of debtor's applicable and actual expenses. Includes within the calculation of debtor's monthly expenses: (1) reasonably necessary expenses incurred to maintain the safety of the debtor and the debtor's family from family violence as identified under the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act; (2) continuation of actual expenses paid by the debtor for the care and support of an elderly, chronically ill, or disabled household or nondependent immediate family member; and (3) an additional allowance for housing and utilities based upon documented home energy expenses. Provides that the presumption of abuse may only be rebutted with detailed documentation of special circumstances requiring additional expenses or adjustment of current monthly total income for which there is no reasonable alternative. Prohibits the court from dismissing or converting a case based on any form of means testing, if the debtor is a disabled veteran and the indebtedness occurred primarily during a period during which he or she was: (1) on active duty or (2) performing a homeland defense activity. Requires the debtor's counsel to reimburse the bankruptcy trustee for legal fees in prosecuting a dismissal or conversion motion if the court finds that counsel's filing under Chapter 7 was in violation of certain bankruptcy rules. Requires the court, upon motion by the victim of a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime (or at the request of a party in interest), to dismiss a voluntary case filed by an individual debtor convicted of that crime (unless the debtor establishes that filing of the case is necessary to satisfy a claim for a domestic support obligation). Redefines \"disposable income\" of a chapter 13 debtor to exclude a domestic support obligation that first becomes payable after the date the petition is filed. Cites circumstances under which a chapter 13 wage earner's plan may be modified after confirmation to include a special allowance for health insurance coverage. (Sec. 103) Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the Treasury has the authority to alter Internal Revenue Service (IRS) standards established to set guidelines for repayment plans as needed to accommodate their use under the Bankruptcy Code. Instructs the Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Trustees to report to certain congressional committees regarding the use of IRS standards for determining specified monthly debtor expenses and the impact of such standards upon debtors and the bankruptcy courts. (Sec. 104) Revises procedural guidelines to mandate a written notice to the individual consumer debtor before commencement of a case stating: (1) the types of services available from credit counseling agencies; (2) the criminal penalties for fraudulent concealment of assets; and (3) that all creditor-supplied information is subject to examination by the Attorney General. (Sec. 105) Instructs the Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Trustees to: (1) develop a financial management training curriculum and materials to educate individual debtors on how to better manage their finances; and (2) test, evaluate, and report to Congress on the curriculum's effectiveness. (Sec. 106) Prohibits an individual debtor from filing under Federal bankruptcy law unless the individual has received a briefing from an approved nonprofit budget and credit counseling service prior to filing a bankruptcy petition, unless the U.S. trustee or bankruptcy administrator determines that the service for the district in which the debtor lives is not reasonably able to provide adequate services to the additional individuals who would otherwise seek credit counseling because of such requirement. Exempts from such prerequisite a debtor whom the court determines is unable to comply due to incapacity, disability, or active military duty in a military combat zone. Conditions a Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 discharge in bankruptcy upon the debtor's completion of an approved instructional course concerning personal financial management. Requires the clerk of each district to maintain a public list of credit counseling agencies and instructional courses concerning personal financial management. Prescribes criteria for approval of such agencies and courses. Prohibits such a counseling service from informing a credit reporting agency whether an individual debtor has received or sought personal financial management instruction. Establishes civil penalties for noncompliance. (Sec. 107) Requires the Director of the Executive Office for United States Trustees to issue schedules of reasonable and necessary administrative expenses of administering a chapter 13 plan for each judicial district of the United States. Title II: Enhanced Consumer Protection - Subtitle A: Penalties for Abusive Creditor Practices - (Sec. 201) Cites circumstances under which the court may reduce a claim based upon unsecured consumer debts by up to 20 percent if the debtor can show by clear and convincing evidence that the claim was filed by a creditor who unreasonably refused to negotiate a reasonable alternative repayment schedule proposed by an approved credit counseling agency acting on the debtor's behalf. (Sec. 202) States that a creditor's willful failure to credit payments received from a debtor is a violation of a discharge operating as an injunction against a collection action if such failure caused material injury to the debtor (with certain exceptions). (Sec. 203) Modifies debt reaffirmation guidelines governing wholly unsecured consumer debts to mandate specified detailed disclosures and explanations to the debtor for dischargeable debt agreements. Exempts a Credit Union creditor from such detailed disclosures and explanations. Amends Federal criminal law to instruct the Attorney General to designate U.S. attorneys and agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to implement enforcement activities relating to: (1) abusive reaffirmations of debt; and (2) materially fraudulent statements in bankruptcy schedules that are intentionally false or misleading. Directs the bankruptcy court to establish procedures referring those cases to the U.S. attorneys and FBI agents. (Sec. 204) Preserves consumer claims and defenses against predatory loans that have been sold by the bankruptcy trustee and that are subject to either the Truth in Lending Act or any consumer credit contract. (Sec. 205) Instructs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the overall treatment of consumers within the context of the debt reaffirmation process, including recommendations for legislation to address abusive or coercive tactics. Subtitle B: Priority Child Support - (Sec. 212) Revises priority payment guidelines to place within the first priority claim category certain unsecured claims for domestic support obligations, if the funds received by a governmental unit are applied in a prescribed order. Grants priority over such claims, however, to specified administrative expenses of certain trustees. (Sec. 213) Conditions court confirmation of a debt repayment plan under Chapters 11, 12 (Debts of a Family Farmer), and 13 upon certification that the debtor has paid in full all adjudicated domestic support obligations that become due after the petition filing date. (Sec. 214) Excepts from an automatic stay specified choses-in-action pertaining to domestic support obligations proceedings, including: (1) child custody or visitation; (2) dissolution of marriage; (3) domestic violence; (4) withholding of income that is property of the bankrupt estate for payment of domestic support obligations; (5) suspension of drivers' licenses and professional licenses; (6) reporting of overdue support owed by a parent to certain consumer reporting agencies; (7) interception of specified tax refunds; and (8) enforcement of medical obligations under title IV, part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of the Social Security Act. (Sec. 215) Revamps guidelines governing the nondischargeability of certain debts for alimony, maintenance, and support to repeal the exceptions granted the debtor under specified conditions. (Sec. 216) Modifies guidelines governing property exempt from the bankruptcy estate to declare such property liable for a debt arising from domestic support obligations. (Sec. 217) Prohibits the bankruptcy trustee from avoiding a transfer that is a bona fide payment of a debt for a domestic support obligation. (Sec. 218) Excludes income payments for postpetition domestic support obligations from \"disposable income\" for purposes of a Chapter 12 confirmation plan. (Sec. 219) Sets forth the duties of the bankruptcy trustee to notify the claim holder and the appropriate State child support agency of the debtor's last known address. (Sec. 220) Declares dischargeable any debts for certain qualified educational loans which, if not discharged, would impose an undue hardship upon either the debtor or the debtor's dependent. Subtitle C: Other Consumer Protections - (Sec. 221) Modifies guidelines governing nonattorney bankruptcy petition preparers to mandate that as a prerequisite to any collection of fees for services: (1) such preparers officially disclose to debtors that they cannot practice law or give legal advice; and (2) such disclosure be signed by the debtor and filed with the requisite court documents. Prescribes enforcement and penalty guidelines for preparer noncompliance. (Sec. 222) Expresses the sense of Congress that States should develop curricula relating to personal finance designed for use in elementary and secondary schools. (Sec. 223) Places in tenth order of priority death or personal injury claims against the bankrupt estate that arise from the debtor's unlawful operation of a motor vehicle or vessel while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. (Sec. 224) Permits an individual debtor to exempt from the property of the bankrupt estate certain tax-exempt retirement funds that have not been obligated in connection with any extension of credit. Excepts from an automatic stay certain income withheld from debtor's wages for the benefit of an employer-sponsored pension, profit-sharing, stock bonus, or other specified plan.

Title X: Protection of Family Farmers and Family Fishermen - (Sec. 1001) Amends the Federal bankruptcy code to reenact Chapter 12, Adjustment of Debts of a Family Farmer with Regular Annual Income, as amended by this Act (thereby reinstating permanently family farmer bankruptcy relief).

(Sec. 1006) Allows the court to confirm a family farmer bankruptcy plan, notwithstanding the objection of the trustee or holder of an allowed unsecured claim, if the value of the property to be distributed under the plan in a specified period is not less than the debtor's projected disposable income for such period. Prohibits any post-confirmation modification of a bankruptcy plan that would increase the amount of payments that were due before such modification. Provides that, unless the debtor proposes the modification, a modified plan may not: (1) require payments to unsecured creditors in any particular month greater than the debtor's disposable income for that month based on an increase in the debtor's disposable income; or (2) if the modification takes place in the plan's last year, require any payments that would leave the debtor with insufficient funds after plan completion to carry on the farming operation.

Title XII: Technical Amendments - (Sec. 1201) Makes technical corrections to Federal bankruptcy, judicial, and criminal law. Redefines single asset real estate to exclude family farms and to repeal the $4 million ceiling on the amount of noncontingent, liquidated secured debts on such property. Defines the term \"transfer\" to include: (1) creation of a lien; (2) retention of title as a security interest; (3) foreclosure of the debtor's equity of redemption; and (4) every mode of disposing of property or parting with an interest in property. (Sec. 1202) Requires triennial adjustment of the $5,000 value of certain implements, professional books, tools of the trade, farm animals, and crops which a debtor may exempt from the property of the estate (protecting them from creditors' liens).

(Sec. 1213) Revises guidelines governing preferences to provide that, if the trustee avoids a security interest given between 90 days and one year before the date of the filing of the petition, by the debtor to a noninsider for the benefit of a creditor that is an insider, then such security interest shall be considered to be avoided only with respect to the insider creditor. (Sec. 1221) Permits the bankruptcy trustee to sell, use, or lease property in accordance with nonbankruptcy law governing the transfer of property by nonprofit charitable corporations, if doing so is not inconsistent with certain relief granted under the automatic stay. (Sec. 1222) Extends from 20 to 30 days the length of time after a debtor receives possession of property for perfection of a security interest in such property created by a transfer which the trustee may not avoid. (Sec. 1223) Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2005 - Amends the Federal judicial code to require appointments for additional temporary bankruptcy judgeships in California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Tennessee, Virginia, South Carolina, and Nevada. Provides that the first vacancy occurring in such district five years or more after a judge is appointed under this Act shall not be filled. Applies such prohibition specifically to certain vacancies in the Central District of California, the Southern District of Florida, and the districts of Delaware and Maryland.

(Sec. 1228) Prohibits a court from granting a discharge in a chapter 7 case, or from confirming a reorganization plan in a chapter 11 or 13 case, unless requested tax documents have been provided to the court. (Sec. 1229) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) consumer credit may sometimes be offered indiscriminately without lender action to ensure consumer repayment capacity, and in a manner which may encourage additional debt accumulation; and (2) resulting consumer debt may increasingly be a major contributing factor to consumer insolvency. Instructs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to study indiscriminate solicitation and extension of credit by the credit industry. Authorizes the Board to: (1) promulgate regulations requiring additional disclosures to consumers; and (2) take measures to ensure responsible industrywide practices and to prevent resulting consumer debt and insolvency. (Sec. 1230) Excludes from property of the estate in bankruptcy certain tangible personal property (other than securities or written or printed evidences of indebtedness or title) pledged or sold by the debtor as collateral for a loan or money advance, where: (1) the pledgee or transferee possesses such property; (2) the debtor has no obligation to repay or redeem; and (3) neither the debtor nor the trustee has exercised any right to redeem in a timely manner.

(Sec. 1402) Extends from one year to two years the look-back period during which the bankruptcy trustee may avoid fraudulent transfers and obligations incurred by either a debtor or partnership debtor under an employment contract and not in the ordinary course of business, including any transfer to or for the benefit of an insider, or any obligation incurred to or for the benefit of an insider. Empowers the trustee to avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property that was made on or within ten years before the date of the filing of the petition, if: (1) such transfer was by the debtor to a self-settled trust or similar device of which the debtor is a beneficiary; and (2) the debtor made such transfer with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any entity to which the debtor was or became, on or after the date that such transfer was made, indebted. (Sec. 1403) Instructs the court, upon motion of a party in interest, to order reinstatement of retiree benefits if the debtor modified them during the 180-day period prior to petition filing and was insolvent on the date of modification (unless the court finds that the balance of the equities clearly favors such modification).
