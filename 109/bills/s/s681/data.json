Requires the Secretary to provide for the establishment of a Board of Directors to administer the Network. Directs the Secretary, acting through the Administrator, to establish as part of the Network a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry to: (1) operate a system for identifying, acquiring, and distributing donated units of cord blood; (2) provide health care professionals with the ability to search the registry for suitable matches for patients; and (3) maintain a database to document the collection, storage, distribution, and clinical outcomes related to the Network. Requires the Administrator to report to the Secretary regarding the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of the clinical, research, and education activities of the Network. Requires the Board to ensure that: (1) the Network donor banks meet eligibility requirements; and (2) the Network is geographically distributed throughout the United States."
