Applies such requirements to the federal civil service. Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require the Secretary to: (1) regulate tobacco products (through the Food and Drug Administration); and (2) establish the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee. Sets forth tobacco product standards and registration, recordkeeping, reporting, manufacturer and importer user fee, labeling, advertising, and marketing requirements. Requires vending machines and certain restaurants to provide nutritional information about each food offered, including the number of calories. Restores the ability of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to restrict the marketing or advertising of foods to children.
