(The required report is one by the Secretary of the Interior to specified congressional committees identifying for each tribal trust fund account for which the Secretary is responsible a balance reconciled as of September 30, 1995.) Extends from December 31, 1999, to December 31, 2000, the earliest date on which the Indian tribe shall be deemed to have received the reconciliation report.
