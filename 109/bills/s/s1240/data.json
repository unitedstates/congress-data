Defines \"qualified truck\" as a motor vehicle: (1) first placed in service on or after January 1, 2007, and before January 1, 2008; (2) powered by diesel fuel; (3) having a gross vehicle weight of more than 26,000 pounds; and (4) which complies with certain Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations for diesel emissions. Allows such credit to reduce regular or alternative minimum tax liability. Permits a taxpayer election to expense the cost of qualified trucks placed in service in 2007."
