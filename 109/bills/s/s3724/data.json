    "text": "EPSCoR Research and Competitiveness Act of 2006 - Authorizes appropriations for FY2007-FY2011 to the National Science Foundation (NSF) for the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). Requires the Director of the NSF: (1) in the administration of the NSF's research infrastructure improvement grant program, to authorize states participating in the grant program to include partnership with out-of-state research institutions if the amount of funding transferred to another state does not exceed 5% of the amount of the grant in any fiscal year; and (2) from the amounts appropriated pursuant to this Act, to make available specified amounts for FY2007-FY2011 to such grant program. Requires the Director to obligate and spend not less than 20% of the amount available for EPSCoR on co-funding projects that are ranked by a peer-review process in the top 20% of all proposals submitted in response to an announced competition. Requires the submission of annual reports providing information concerning: (1) co-funded projects on a state-by-state basis; and (2) the amount and use of co-funding by each of the NSF's directorates. Requires the Director: (1) through the Office of Cyber Infrastructure, to develop and publish a plan enabling states participating in EPSCoR to develop partnerships and participate fully in the NSF's Cyber Infrastructure Initiative; and (2) through the Office of Major Research Instrumentation, to develop and publish a plan enabling states participating in EPSCoR to develop partnerships and participate fully in the NSF's major research instrumentation program."
