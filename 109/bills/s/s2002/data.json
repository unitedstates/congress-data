    "text": "BSE and Other Prion Disease Prevention and Public Health Protection Act - Prohibits the importation of a covered article that: (1) if containing animal-derived material, does not state in English that the covered article contains animal-derived material and the name of the derivative animal, and if a ruminant, identifies the country of origin and states whether specified risk material from the ruminant is or may be part of the covered article; (2) if not containing animal-derived material, does not state in English that the covered article does not contain animal-derived material; and (3) contains animal-derived material from a ruminant that was in any country at a time at which there was a transmission risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Prohibits the introduction into interstate or foreign commerce of a covered article that contains: (1) specified risk material from a ruminant, or any material from a ruminant that was in any foreign country when there was a BSE transmission risk; or (2) any material from a ruminant exhibiting signs of a neurological disease. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: (1) develop an enforcement plan for the regulatory ban of certain animal proteins in ruminant feed; (2) promulgate regulations prohibiting same-farm admixing of ruminant and nonruminant feed; (3) in conjunction with the National Prion Disease Pathology Research Center at Case Western Reserve University, expand survey efforts for prion diseases in humans; and (4) monitor animal feed and provide for the registration of certain animal feed businesses. Directs the Secretary to accelerate the establishment of a ruminant identification program capable of tracing, within 48 hours, the movements of disease-exposed animals from birth to slaughter. Directs the Secretaries to: (1) jointly establish a prion disease task force; and (2) develop appropriate compliance standards. Defines: (1) covered article; (2) prion disease; and (3) specified risk material."
