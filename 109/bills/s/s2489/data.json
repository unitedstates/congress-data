Title II: Complementary Access - (Sec. 201) Prohibits complementary access to any location in the United States pursuant to the Additional Protocol without the authorization of the U.S. Government. Authorizes complementary IAEA access in accordance with this Act to any location in the United States subject to access under the Additional Protocol.

(Sec. 202) Prescribes complementary access procedures, including consents, administrative search warrants, and warrantless complementary access. States it is unlawful for any person willfully to fail, refuse to permit, or otherwise impede complementary access authorized by this Act, or an entry in connection with such access. Title III: Confidentiality of Information - (Sec. 301) Exempts information acquired by the U.S. Government under this Act or under the Additional Protocol from certain statutory disclosure requirements. Title IV: Enforcement - (Sec. 401) Prescribes recordkeeping procedures. Sets forth civil and criminal penalties for: (1) recordkeeping violations; and (2) impeding authorized complementary access.

Grants federal district courts jurisdiction over civil actions brought by the head of certain designated executive agencies. Title V: Environmental Sampling - (Sec. 501) Requires the President to notify certain congressional committees of IAEA Board approval of wide-area environmental sampling for use as a safeguards verification tool. (Sec. 502) Prohibits the United States from permitting either wide-area or location-specific environmental sampling proposed by the IAEA in the United States unless the President has made and reported specified determinations to certain congressional committees.
