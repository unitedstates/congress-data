Requires the Trail to be administered by the Secretary of the Interior in coordination with: (1) the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network authorized under the Chesapeake Bay Initiative Act of 1998; and (2) the Chesapeake Bay Program authorized under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Prohibits the United States from acquiring for the Trail any land or interest in land outside the exterior boundary of any federally-managed area without the consent of the owner of such land or interest."
