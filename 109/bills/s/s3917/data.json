    "text": "American-Made Energy Freedom Act of 2006 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) increase tax credits for cellulosic biomass ethanol; (2) extend the energy credit for solar and fuel cell property; (3) extend and modify the credits for residential energy efficient property and for certain liquid fuel derived from coal; and (4) establish the American-Made Energy Trust Fund to implement designated sections of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, including climate change technology deployment. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to undertake a competitive oil and gas leasing program that will result in an environmentally sound program for the exploration, development, and production of the oil and gas resources of the Coastal Plain of Alaska. Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 to repeal the prohibition against production of oil and gas from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and any leasing or development leading to such production. Prescribes procedures for: (1) lease sales; (2) grants of leases; and (3) Coastal Plain environmental protection; (4) rights-of-way and easements for the transportation of oil and gas across the Coastal Plain. Directs the Secretary to convey: (1) the surface estate of specified lands to the Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation; and (2) the remaining subsurface estate of specified lands to the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation. Establishes the Coastal Plain Local Government Impact Aid Assistance Fund to provide financial assistance to specified entities directly impacted by oil and gas production and exploration on the Coastal Plain."
