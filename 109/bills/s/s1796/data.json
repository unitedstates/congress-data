Permits victims of domestic or sexual violence to substitute existing leave in lieu of emergency leave.

Amends the Internal Revenue Code relating to approval of state unemployment compensation laws to prohibit denial of compensation where an individual is separated from employment owing to circumstances resulting from the individual's experience of domestic or sexual violence. Amends the Social Security Act to include training with respect to clients in such violent circumstances for: (1) unemployment compensation personnel; and (2) TANF personnel. Authorizes grants for a model training program. Victims' Employment Sustainability Act - Prohibits certain discriminatory employer practices relating to terms or conditions of employment in connection with victims of domestic or sexual violence.
