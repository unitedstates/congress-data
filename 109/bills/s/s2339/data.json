    "text": "Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2006 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize appropriations for HIV health care services programs. Requires recipients of HIV-related grants to expend not less than 75 percent of such funds on primary medical care. Amends the formula for awarding grant funds to consider the number of HIV (currently, AIDS) cases. Makes ineligible for funding any state or locality that imposes significant barriers to partner notification programs or routine testing. Provides for treatment for hepatitis B or hepatitis C for HIV-positive individuals who are co-infected. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to require: (1) rapid routine testing of each client at any entity receiving funding from certain federal programs; and (2) federally funded health facilities to offer routine testing for pregnant women and newborns. Requires the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to annually purchase and distribute rapid HIV tests. Requires the Secretary to issue guidelines for therapeutics to be included in state formularies. Allows states to use grant funds to provide services to Medicaid-eligible individuals with HIV. Amends the AIDS Housing Opportunity Act to make grant allocations based on the number of HIV (currently, AIDS) cases. Requires the Secretary to ensure that not less than 75 percent of grant amounts are used for the provision, construction, maintenance, or development of housing assistance. Requires the Secretary to provide state AIDS officials with the authority to request and obtain all necessary information in order to coordinate HIV care and treatment with other federally funded projects."
