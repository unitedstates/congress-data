Expands such crime to include conspiracies and attempts. Revises and increases monetary and criminal penalties for such crime. Modifies the definition of \"animal enterprise\" to include: (1) an enterprise that uses or sells animals or animal products for profit for educational purposes; and (2) an animal shelter, pet store, breeder, or furrier. Provides that expressive conduct (including picketing or other peaceful demonstration) protected by the First Amendment is not prohibited by this Act."
