Requires the Secretary of Defense to establish the position of Citizenship Advocate at each military entry processing station to provide information and assistance to members of the Armed Forces on the naturalization process. Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to: (1) establish a toll-free naturalization assistance telephone number available only to members and their families; and (2) after any modification of naturalization laws, update the appropriate application form, instructions and guidebook, and Internet website to reflect such modification. Directs the Comptroller General to: (1) report to the congressional defense and judiciary committees on the entire process for adjudication of an application for naturalization; and (2) conduct a study on the implementation of this Act by the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Defense."
