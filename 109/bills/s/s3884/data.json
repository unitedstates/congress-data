    "text": "Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006 - Sets forth the sense of Congress with respect to the situation in Darfur, Sudan, including the sense of Congress that the atrocities unfolding in Darfur are genocide, and the need for U.S. and international involvement in Darfur. Amends the Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act of 2004 to direct the President, with waiver authority upon congressional notification, to block the assets and deny visas and entry to any individual complicit in or responsible for acts of genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity in Darfur, including certain family members or associates of such individual. Authorizes the President to provide assistance to reinforce an expanded African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS). States that the President should take steps to deny the government of Sudan access to oil revenues, including prohibiting U.S. port entry to cargo ships or oil tankers engaged in trade activities in Sudan's oil sector or involved in the shipment of goods for the Armed Forces of Sudan until the government of Sudan has honored its commitments to cease attacks on civilians, demobilize and demilitarize the Janjaweed and associated militias, grant access for humanitarian assistance, and allow for the safe and voluntary return of refugees and internally displaced persons. Exempts from such prohibition cargo ships or oil tankers involved in: (1) an internationally recognized demobilization program or the shipment of economic assistance; or (2) the shipment of certain military assistance. Prohibits, with national interest waiver authority, U.S. assistance to a country in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1591 (embargo on military assistance to Sudan). States that certain restrictions against the government of Sudan shall remain in place until the President makes specified certifications to the appropriate congressional committees regarding the government of Sudan. Amends the Assistance for International Malaria Control Act to repeal provisions authorizing the President to provide additional assistance to, and exempting prohibitions on exports from, areas outside the control of the government of Sudan. Amends the Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act of 2004 to repeal the provision authorizing the President to provide additional nonmilitary assistance to areas outside the control of the government of Sudan. Authorizes the President, subject to congressional notification by the Secretary of State, to provide economic assistance for Southern Sudan, Southern Kordofan/Nuba Mountains State, Blue Nile State, and Abyei. Authorizes the President to provide specified military assistance to the government of Sudan. Waives prohibitions concerning Sudan in Executive Order No. 13067 regarding activities with respect to Southern Sudan, Southern Kordofan/Nuba Mountains State, Blue Nile State, and Abyei."
