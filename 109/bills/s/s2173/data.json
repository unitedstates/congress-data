Requires such outreach and education to address: (1) the full-benefit dual eligible population; (2) the transition from Medicaid prescription drug coverage to part D coverage for such population; and (3) the processes established by the Secretary to facilitate, at point of sale, identification of the drug plan assignment of such population or enrollment of previously unidentified or new full-benefit dual eligible individuals into Medicare part D prescription drug coverage. Directs the Secretary to reimburse pharmacies fully for: (1) any transaction fees associated with point-of-sale facilitated identification and enrollment processes; and (2) costs associated with any technology or software upgrade necessary to make any identification and enrollment inquiries as part of such processes."
