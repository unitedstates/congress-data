Directs the Secretary to provide to each member of the National Guard and reserves who serves on active duty in a combat theater a session of group counseling, a session of private counseling, and a presentation on counseling-related matters to the family of such member. Requires the member's counseling to be provided within 14 days after their return from such deployment. Authorizes additional counseling upon member request."
