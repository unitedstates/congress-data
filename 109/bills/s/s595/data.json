Expands eligibility for the consolidated tax credit by: (1) determining eligibility of ex-felons without regard to family income; and (2) raising the age ceiling for food stamp recipients from 25 to 40. Includes a \"designated community resident\" (in lieu of \"high risk youth\") and \"long-term family assistance recipient\" as members of the targeted group eligible for the consolidated tax credit. Provides for an increased tax credit for employment of long-term family assistance recipients. Repeals the separate welfare-to-work tax credit."
