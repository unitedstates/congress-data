    "text": "Child Medication Safety Act of 2006 - Requires states, as a condition of receiving funds under any program or activity administered by the Secretary of Education, to develop and implement policies and procedures prohibiting school personnel from requiring a child, as a condition of attending school or receiving services, to obtain a prescription for any specified controlled substances listed under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Provides that nothing in such requirement shall be construed to create a federal prohibition against teachers and other school personnel consulting or sharing classroom-based observations with parents or guardians regarding a student's academic performance or behavior in the classroom or school, or regarding the need for evaluation for special education or related services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Directs the Comptroller General to review and report on: (1) variation among state definitions of psychotropic medication in state jurisdiction over public education; (2) prescription rates of medications used in public schools to treat children diagnosed with attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and other disorders or illnesses; and (3) which of such medications are CSA-listed and which are not, including properties and effects of the latter and whether they have been considered for CSA-listing."
