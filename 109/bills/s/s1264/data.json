Prohibits any hospital from receiving federal funds unless such hospital provides to survivors of sexual assault, regardless of ability to pay: (1) an assessment of the individual's risk for contracting sexually transmitted infections; (2) advice concerning significantly prevalent infections for which effective post-exposure prophylaxis exists and for which the deferral of treatment either would significantly reduce treatment efficacy or would pose substantial risk to the individual's health; and (3) such prophylactic treatment for infections, upon request."
