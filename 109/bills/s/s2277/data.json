Defines \"covered task order\" to mean a task order valued at more than $10 million entered into pursuant to a contract entered into before this Act's enactment. Allows the President to waive such restrictions if the President determines that it is in the national security interest of the United States and submits to the appropriate congressional authorities a report describing the reasons for such determination."
