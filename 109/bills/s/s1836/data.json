    "text": "Gulf Coast Infrastructure Redevelopment and Recovery Act of 2005 - Federal Infrastructure Preparedness Act of 2005 - Directs the Secretary of the Army to establish a Federal Infrastructure Task Force to improve preparedness for the effects of extreme weather events on U.S infrastructure. Requires the Task Force to serve as the coordinating entity to distribute federal funding for infrastructure redevelopment required by Hurricane Katrina (Katrina). Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to obligate more than $100 million in a state for a fiscal year under the emergency relief program for projects for the repair or reconstruction of highways, roads, and trails in response to Katrina. Emergency Water Infrastructure Assistance Act of 2005 - Authorizes Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi to provide additional subsidization to projects that receive funds through a revolving loan under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to repair, replace or rebuild publicly-owned treatment works in Katrina-affected areas or water quality projects directly related to relief efforts. Amends: (1) the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 to authorize appropriations for post-disaster economic recovery; and (2) the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to authorize the Delta Regional Authority to designate as a disaster area a county or parish that is affected by the declaration of a major disaster in response to Katrina. Directs the Authority to establish the Delta Regional Authority Hurricane Katrina Relief Fund. Directs: (1) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to use specified funds for activities, including cleanup, reconstruction, and rehabilitation of drinking water supplies and wastewater treatment plants, and to report on hazardous materials releases; and (2) the Secretary, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to conduct an assessment of Corps infrastructure in the region to determine whether opportunities exist for project modifications that may reduce future hurricane impacts. National Levee Safety Program Act of 2005 - Directs the Secretary to: (1) carry out a program under which the Secretary inspects U.S. levees every 10 years; (2) establish the Interagency Committee on Levee Safety; (3) establish the National Levee Safety Review Board; and (4) establish and maintain a national levee safety program. Emergency Water Infrastructure Assistance Act of 2005 - Authorizes the Administrator of General Services to enter into an emergency lease, for up to five years, during a major disaster declared by the President or the head of a federal agency. Habitability of Residential Homes, Schools, and Commercial Buildings Affected by Hurricane Katrina Act of 2005 - Directs the Administrator to establish a grant program to pay the federal share of the cost of abatement and inspection activities for residential homes, commercial buildings, and schools affected by Katrina. Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to provide reimbursement for the establishment of commuter assistance programs to improve worker access to assist in the rapid recovery of communities in response to a major disaster."
