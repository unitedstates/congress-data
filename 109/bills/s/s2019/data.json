Directs the Assistant Administrator: (1) every three years, to convene a conference of appropriate state agencies, individuals, and organizations involved in research and other activities directly related to the environmental or biological impacts of former methamphetamine laboratories to be a forum for exchanging information relating to such guidelines; and (2) to enter into an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) for a study of the status and quality of research on the residual effects of methamphetamine laboratories. Requires the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to support a research program to develop: (1) new methamphetamine detection technologies, with an emphasis on field test kits and site detection; and (2) appropriate standard reference materials and validation procedures for methamphetamine detection testing."
