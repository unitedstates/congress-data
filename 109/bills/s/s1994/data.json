    "text": "Fuel Security and Consumer Choice Act - Amends federal transportation law to require manufacturers of new automobiles that can operate on gasoline or diesel fuel (dual fueled automobiles) to manufacture such automobiles by increasing percentages for 10 model years and beyond. Allows manufacturers to earn credits which may be applied to any three consecutive model years after the year in which they were earned if the manufacturer exceeds the number of dual fueled automobiles required to be manufactured in a particular year. Authorizes a manufacturer to sell credits to another manufacturer to enable the purchaser to meet the percentage requirements under this Act. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to measure the fuel economy for each model of dual fueled automobile based on certain formulas."
