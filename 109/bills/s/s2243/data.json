Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to: (1) grant forgiveness of student loan indebtedness up to $17,500 for individuals working in certain public service positions, including math and science teachers, emergency workers, and nurses in low-income communities; (2) require the Secretary of Education (formerly, discretionary on a case-by-case basis) to award Pell Grants to certain full-time students enrolled in college degree programs; (3) establish a special transition assistance plan for certain student loan borrowers; (4) establish a grant program to encourage transfers of academic credits between institutions of higher learning; and (5) expand the discretionary authority of student financial aid administrators in regulating student loan terms."
