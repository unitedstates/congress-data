Directs the Secretary to offer to enter into a binding agreement with the City and any other non-federal sponsor to carry out the plan and to pay at least 50% of the costs. Authorizes the Secretary to recommend any locally-preferred project as an alternative to a measure proposed in the plan. Requires each such project to be included in the feasibility report or in an environmental impact statement or analysis. Authorizes the Secretary to construct a pilot project to provide information to develop the plan. Directs the Secretary to: (1) offer to enter into a binding agreement with the City and any other non-federal sponsor to carry out each such pilot project and to pay at least 35% of the costs; and (2) assign a priority to each project. Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1992 to authorize appropriations for a Los Angeles River water reuse project, including measures for environmental restoration and revitalization."
