    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "2005-05-26", 
    "text": "Dirty Bomb Prevention Act - Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to direct the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to promulgate regulations: (1) prohibiting the export of a radiation source unless it has found specified requirements have been met; and (2) establishing a mandatory tracking system for all radiation sources in the United States. Subjects violations of such regulations to a specified civil penalty. Establishes a task force on radiation source protection and security to provide recommendations to ensure the security of radiation sources from potential terrorist threats, including acts of sabotage, theft, or use of such radiation sources in a radiological dispersal device. Expands the definition of byproduct material to include treatment of accelerator-produced and other radioactive material. Instructs the NRC, in its promulgation of implementing rules, to consider the impact on the availability of radiopharmaceuticals to the physicians and patients whose medical treatment relies on them. Amends the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act to exclude from its definition of low-level radioactive waste the byproduct material defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Requires the Secretary, within six months of the enactment of this Act, to report to Congress on the location and status of all nuclear fuel exported by the federal government."
