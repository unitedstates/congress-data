Protects a governmental or other entity from federal or state civil liability for personal injuries, property damage or loss, or death caused by fire control or fire rescue equipment which such entity donates to a volunteer fire company, unless such entity is guilty of gross negligence or intentional misconduct. Amends the Public Health Service Act to extend civil liability protections to certain medical practitioners (licensed physicians or clinical psychologists) who donate health care services to patients at health centers for medically underserved populations."
