Describes such a gap as the period between the date on which the individual has reached the initial coverage limit and the date on which he or she has reached the annual out-of-pocket threshold. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to reduce the initial funding of the Medicare Advantage Regional Plan Stabilization Fund to offset the estimated cost of such premium waivers."
