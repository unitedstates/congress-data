Requires that states use funds to carry out demonstration projects by integrating public education efforts, Healthy Lifestyle Choices programs, Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRC), and Community Living Incentives programs into their systems of long-term care. Requires states to conduct public education activities to ensure that consumers are aware of long-term care issues. Requires states to provide for community-level ADRCs, which are required to provide: (1) comprehensive information on available public and private long-term care programs, options, and resources; (2) personal counseling and service coordination to assist consumers in assessing their long-term care needs and circumstances and in developing and implementing a plan for such care; (3) a convenient point of entry to publicly supported long-term care programs for which an individual may be eligible; (4) a single process for consumer intake, assessment, and applications for benefits programs; (5) the ability to respond immediately to a request for assistance in a crisis situation that could result in placement in an institutional care setting; and (6) to provide such assistance to temporarily preclude the need for such placement. Requires states to ensure that the ADRC staffs are trained to understand the interactions between private long-term care insurance and eligibility for Medicaid benefits. Requires states to: (1) provide for low-cost, community-level, evidence-based prevention programs and related tools to assist older individuals and their family caregivers in learning about and making behavioral changes intended to reduce the risk of injury, disease, and disability among older individuals; (2) provide funding toward the provision of long-term care to individuals at high risk for institutional placement; (3) ensure that individuals at greatest risk for becoming eligible for benefits under the Medicaid program receive priority for long-term care; (4) assess the needs and preferences of high-risk individuals with respect to long-term care and to develop plans for such care; (5) ensure that funding for Community Living Incentives programs be allocated among, and disbursed for, the budgets of high-risk individuals under long-term care plans; and (6) provide high-risk individuals with the option to receive long-term care in a manner that permits individuals to direct and control, in conjunction with a service coordinator, the selection, planning, budgeting, and purchasing of such care. Sets the federal share for the cost of demonstration projects at not more than 75%. Requires states to ensure that ADRCs: (1) coordinate their activities with any state health insurance information, counseling, and assistance program receiving funding; (2) are subject to controls to ensure there is not a conflict of interest with respect to any referrals made by the ADRC for individuals' receiving services; and (3) provide no long-term care services or supplies, with the exception of case management services provided through the area agencies on aging. Excludes payments made for high-risk individuals from an individual's gross income for the purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and for purposes of determining the individual's eligibility or cost-sharing for any other federal or state program. Requires the Assistant Secretary to provide for: (1) technical assistance and oversight of states carrying out demonstration projects for the purpose of administration, quality assurance, and quality improvement; and (2) an evaluation of the demonstration projects and a report to the President. (Sec. 44) States that an underemployed person is considered to be an unemployed person. Requires older American community service employment projects to serve the needs of eligible individuals with limited English proficiency. Limits participation in the Older American Community Service Employment Program to no more than 36 months in the aggregate. Allows Program grantees to extend the period of participation for no more than 20% of the project participants. Requires the grantee, in selecting participants for such extended period, to give priority to participants age 65 and older, frail older individuals, and individuals who have specified barriers to employment. Authorizes grantees to petition for a waiver of the 36-month limit if the grantee serves a high concentration of individuals who are hard-to-serve because they have more than one specified barrier to employment. Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the Program was created with the intent of placing older individuals in community service positions to provide job training placements; and (2) placing older individuals in such positions strengthens the ability of individuals to become self-sufficient, provides volunteer support to organizations that benefit from increased civic engagement, and strengthens the communities served. Requires the Secretary of Labor to consult with the Assistant Secretary regarding establishing and implementing performance measures for grantees.. Includes among factors for which the levels of performance (applicable to performance indicators) may be adjusted: (1) not less than 60% of counties in areas served by grantees are rural; and (2) the areas served by the grantee comprise a difficult-to-serve territory due to limited economies of scale. Eliminates the requirement that grants be awarded for a period of a year by requiring the Secretary to award grants to carry out projects for a four-year period through a competitive process that emphasizes meeting performance measures. Stipulates than an applicant is eligible to receive a grant according to criteria in current law. Adds the following as criteria for grantee selection: (1) the applicant's performance and the applicant's ability to meet the required indicators; and (2) the applicant's ability to administer a program that provides community service and to minimize disruption in services for participants and employers. Repeals provisions concerning corrective action for a grantee's failure to meet performance standards and instead requires the Secretary to provide technical assistance to the grantee. Adds the following groups to the definition of individuals with barriers to employment: minority and Indian individuals, individuals with limited English proficiency, and individuals with greatest economic need. Requires a national grant recipient, in selecting subgrantees in areas where a substantial population of individuals with barriers to employment exists, to give special consideration to selecting organizations with demonstrated expertise in serving individuals with barriers to employment. Prohibits the Secretary from promulgating rules affecting grantees in areas where a substantial population of minority individuals exists that would significantly compromise the ability of grantees to serve their targeted populations.
