Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Secretary to conduct a nationwide assessment to determine the degree to which communications interoperability has been achieved to date, and to ascertain the needs that remain for interoperability to be achieved. Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish a comprehensive research and development program to promote communications interoperability among first responders; and (2) make grants to states and eligible regions for initiatives necessary to achieve short-tern or long-term solutions to statewide, regional, national, and where appropriate, international interoperability."
