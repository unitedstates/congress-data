    "text": "Immigration Accountability Act of 2005 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to create an earned permanent resident status adjustment program for long-term undocumented aliens who have satisfied requirements respecting: (1) security and law enforcement clearance; (2) U.S. residency and employment duration; (3) admissibility; (4) payment of federal and state income taxes; (5) citizenship skills; and (6) selective service registration. Sets forth provisions respecting: (1) criminal penalties for false application statements; (2) public benefits eligibility; (3) administrative and judicial review; (4) fees; (5) employer protections; and (6) derivative status for the spouses and children. Creates a program for qualifying illegal aliens who cannot meet the earned adjustment program work or residence requirements under which such aliens may be granted deferred mandatory departure status (three-year maximum) in order to leave the United States and subsequently seek immigrant or nonimmigrant admission. Sets forth provisions respecting: (1) U.S. residency and employment; (2) admissibility (and ineligibility); (3) medical examination; (4) security and law enforcement clearance; (5) registration at time of departure; (6) terms of status; (7) criminal penalties for false application statements; (8) fees; (9) employability; and (10) judicial review. Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to allow aliens granted adjustment of status under this Act to correct social security records without criminal prosecution. Amends INA to exempt immediate relatives from the family-sponsored immigration cap. Expands the definition of immediate relatives to include spouses and children of lawful permanent residents."
