Requires the value of the exchanged federal and state lands to be equal or made equal by cash payment to the United States or Idaho. Sets forth requirements for: (1) the appraisal of the value of such lands, including that the appraisals be reviewed by an interdepartmental review team comprised of representatives of federal and state agencies; and (2) the disposition and use of proceeds from cash equalization payments received by the United States. Extends the term of approval of such appraisals by the interdepartmental review team to September 13, 2008. Requires the conveyance of certain easements or rights-of-way. Directs the city of Boise, Idaho, to pay the administrative costs associated with such land exchange. (Sec. 4) Transfers administrative jurisdiction over specified BLM land in Shoshone County, Idaho, from the Secretary of the Interior to the Secretary of Agriculture. Requires any land designated as a Wilderness Study Area that is transferred to the Secretary of Agriculture to be managed in a manner that preserves the suitability of land for designation as wilderness until Congress determines otherwise. Provides for the administration of transferred or conveyed lands. Considers the boundaries of the Idaho Panhandle National Forests and Clearwater National Forest, as modified by the exchange authorized by this Act, to be the boundaries of such Forests as of January 1, 1965. (Sec. 5) Revokes any public land orders withdrawing any of the federal land from appropriation or disposal under the public land laws necessary to permit disposal of such land. Withdraws the federal and state land from: (1) location, entry, and patent under the mining and public land laws; and (2) disposition under the mineral leasing laws and the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970."
