Provides for a reduced family assistance grant as a penalty for states failing to provide such services. Requires a pre-sanction review process. Provides for a similar penalty for states not following such process. Revises data collection and reporting requirements. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) conduct longitudinal studies of a representative sample of families that receive TANF assistance; and (2) ensure that public disclosure with respect to any information concerning TANF recipients or applicants is made in a manner that protects their privacy."
