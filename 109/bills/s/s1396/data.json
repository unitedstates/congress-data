Allows the Securities and Exchange Commission to adjust such amount consistent with the public interest, protection of investors, and the public purpose. Includes as an eligible business development company, also for such purposes, an investment company: (1) without any such class of equity securities; or (2) that is not an eligible portfolio company because the aggregate value of its outstanding publicly traded equity securities is more than $250 million but not more than $500 million, as long as such securities represent no more than ten percent of the total invested assets of the company."
