    "text": "National Flood Mapping Act of 2005 - Amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to require the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to cooperate with state and local mapping partners in establishing, updating, and maintaining flood-risk zone data and estimating the rates of loss caused by floods in flood-risk zones. Requires specified federal agency heads to give the highest practicable priority in the allocation of manpower and other resources to the review and updating of maps in coastal areas. Requires flood insurance maps and related information to be made available on the FEMA website and in a format that is digital and geospatial data-compliant. Amends the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 to direct the Technical Mapping Advisory Council to make recommendations to the Director with respect to: (1) performance metrics and milestones to effectively and efficiently map flood risk areas; and (2) procedures for delegating mapping activities to state and local government mapping partners. Makes the Council permanent. Requires the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Emergency Preparedness and Response, acting through the Director of FEMA or a successor official, to establish a program for review, updating, and maintenance of National Flood Insurance Program rate maps in accordance with this Act. Requires the Secretary of Homeland Security, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, to identify areas that are, or could be, affected by hurricanes. Directs the Comptroller General to review the guidance and regulations issued pursuant to Executive Order 11988 to: (1) determine federal agency compliance with the Order; and (2) make recommendations for restricting federal investment and assistance in floodplains. Directs the Secretary to publish periodically an inventory of levees in the United States."
