Directs the NRC to consider requiring licensees of such facilities to give notice of any release: (1) within 24 hours after it happens; (2) to the NRC and state and county governments in which the facility is located if an unplanned release exceeds allowable limits for normal operation, is not subject to more stringent NRC requirements or enters into the environment, and may cause drinking water sources to exceed a maximum radioactive contaminant level; and (3) to such state and county governments if the unplanned release reaches the environment by a path otherwise not allowed or recognized by the facility's operating license but falls within the allowable limits for normal operation. Declares that this Act does not provide to any state or county that receives such notice regulatory jurisdiction over a licensee of such a facility."
