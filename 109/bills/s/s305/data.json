    "text": "Department of the Interior Volunteer Recruitment Act of 2005 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to recruit, train, and accept, without regard to the civil service laws, the services of individuals, contributed without compensation as volunteers, to assist with or facilitate the activities administered by the Secretary through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Office of the Secretary. Prohibits: (1) the Secretary, in accepting the services of volunteers, from permitting the use of volunteers in law enforcement, in regulatory and enforcement work, in policy-making processes, or to displace any employee; and (2) volunteer services authorized by this Act from being conducted on private property unless the officer or employee charged with supervising the volunteer obtains from the property owner appropriate consent to enter the property. Authorizes the Secretary to accept the services of a volunteer in hazardous duty only if the Secretary determines that the volunteer is skilled in performing hazardous activities. Directs the Secretary to ensure that an appropriate U.S. officer or employee provides adequate and appropriate supervision of each individual that volunteers under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to provide for services and costs incidental to the use of volunteers under this Act."
