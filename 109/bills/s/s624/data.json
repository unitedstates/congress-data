    "text": "Patriot Penalty Elimination Act of 2005 - Directs the Secretary of the military department concerned to pay income preservation pay to a member of the reserves: (1) who is called or ordered to active duty (other than voluntarily); (2) who serves on such duty outside the United States during at least six out of 12 consecutive months; and (3) whose preservice income exceeds the amount earned from the military service. Provides a formula for determining the appropriate income preservation amount, with a limit of $50,000. Terminates such pay authority five years after the enactment of this Act. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a Ready Reserve-National Guard employee credit equal to 50 percent of the lesser of the actual compensation amount with respect to the employee for the taxable year, or $30,000. Provides such credit, with respect to such employee, for: (1) active duty outside the United States under a call or order for a period in excess of 179 days or for an indefinite period, in connection with which the employee is entitled to reemployment rights and other benefits or to a leave of absence from employment; and (2) hospitalization incident to such duty. Terminates such credit five years after the enactment of this Act."
