Directs the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security to carry out a program to facilitate access of representatives of military and veterans' service organizations and agencies to provide preseparation counseling and services to members of the Armed Forces who are scheduled for discharge, release from active duty, or retirement. Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a similar program for facilitating the access of such representatives to provide information and counseling to veterans on the care, benefits, and services offered through the Department. Directs the Secretary of the military department concerned to ensure that preseparation counseling is provided by personnel and offices that are not responsible for encouraging service members to reenlist."
