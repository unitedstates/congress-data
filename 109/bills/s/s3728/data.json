States that in view of North Korea's determination to produce missiles, nuclear weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction and to proliferate missiles, and in view of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1695 (prevention by Member states of missile and related transfers to or from North Korea), it should be U.S. policy to impose sanctions on persons who transfer such weapons and related goods and technology to and from North Korea in the same manner as persons who transfer such items to and from Iran and Syria currently are sanctioned under U.S. law. Urges all governments to comply with Resolution 1695 and to impose measures on persons involved in such proliferation that are similar to those imposed by the United States pursuant to the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act, as amended by this Act."
