    "text": "Heroes at Home Act of 2006 - Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 to require the Department of Defense Task Force on Mental Health, in addition to current duties, to report to the Secretary of Defense an assessment of, and recommendations for, improving assistance to members of the National Guard and reserve returning from deployment in Operations Iraqi Freedom or Enduring Freedom, and their families, in transitioning to civilian employment. Directs the Secretary to establish the Assistance Center for Employers and Employment Assistance Organizations to assist employers, employment assistance organizations, and associations of employers in facilitating such transition. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to carry out demonstration projects to assess the feasibility and advisability of utilizing community-based settings for the provision of assistance to such returning members and their families, including: (1) reuniting services; and (2) education to increase awareness of the physical and mental health difficulties, including post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, that members can and may experience. Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a 15-year study on the effects of traumatic brain injury incurred by such members; and (2) establish within the Department of Defense the Traumatic Brain Injury Family Caregiver Panel to develop curricula for training family members in the provision of care and assistance to returning members for traumatic brain injuries incurred during such service."
