Defines \"unconscionably excessive price\" as one that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) determines represents a gross disparity between the price charged by a supplier for that product after a major disaster is declared and the average price the supplier charged for that product in the affected area during the 30-day period immediately before the disaster declaration. Empowers the FTC to: (1) treat a violation of this Act as an unfair or deceptive act or practice prohibited under the Federal Trade Commission Act (ACT); and (2) prevent any person from violating this Act in the same manner as provided under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Subjects a violator of this Act to the penalties provided in the Federal Trade Commission Act."
