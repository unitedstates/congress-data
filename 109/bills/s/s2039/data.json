Requires borrowers who are involuntarily separated from employment due to misconduct or who voluntarily leave employment before the required three-year period to repay any benefits received under this Act. Limits the amount of loans which may be repaid to $10,000 for any borrower in any calendar year, or an aggregate total of $60,000 for any borrower. Authorizes the Attorney General to enter into an additional loan repayment agreement with a borrower to remain employed as a prosecutor or public defender for a period of less than three years. Authorizes appropriations."
