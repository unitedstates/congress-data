    "text": "Veterans' Enhanced Transition Services Act of 2005 - Requires the Secretary concerned to: (1) require preseparation counseling for members of reserve components who have been serving on active duty continuously for at least 180 days; and (2) ensure that commanders authorize such members to obtain counseling during duty time. Requires preseparation counseling on: (1) certification and licensure requirements for civilian occupations; and (2) civilian occupations that correspond to military occupational specialties.

Extends preseparation counseling to members of the National Guard being separated from long-term duty. Directs the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security to require participation in the Department of Labor transitional services program unless members previously participated in the program or are returning to previously held employment or educational pursuits. Requires the Secretary concerned to ensure that commanders authorize such members to obtain counseling during duty time. Directs the Secretaries of Defense, Homeland Security, and Veterans Affairs to jointly submit to Congress a plan to maximize access to benefits delivery at discharge programs for members of the Armed Forces.
