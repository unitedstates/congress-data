Johnston Cascades Volcano Observatory, Vancouver, Washington, in monitoring the activities of Mount St. Helens. Acknowledges the progress in science that has led to a more comprehensive understanding of volcanology, seismology, and plate tectonics, thus enhancing the ability to predict volcanic activity and eruptions. Supports monitoring volcanoes and helping to develop emergency response plans to ensure that the people and communities of the United States are safe."
