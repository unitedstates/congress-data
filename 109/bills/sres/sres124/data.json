Stresses the need to begin early intervention services soon after an individual has been diagnosed with autism. Expresses support for the Federal Government funding 40 percent of the costs needed to educate children with disabilities. Recognizes the shortage of appropriately trained teachers and the importance of worker training programs that meet the needs of developmentally disabled individuals."
