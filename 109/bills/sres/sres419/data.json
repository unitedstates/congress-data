Believes that countries charged with protecting human rights throughout the world should be required to hold democratic elections, allow for freedom of expression, and have a credible civil society. Finds that the creation of the Council fails to adequately reform the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, and prevent the worst human rights abusers from attaining Council membership. Applauds the Administration for opposing the creation of the new council, and believes that the United States should seek membership on such council. Urges the Administration to not support the Council, and to advocate in favor of withdrawing financial support until meaningful reforms are undertaken. Believes the United States should strengthen the work of the international community of democracies by establishing an effective human rights oversight body outside the U.N. system."
