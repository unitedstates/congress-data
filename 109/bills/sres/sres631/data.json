Declares that the deployment of a United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force under U.N. command is the minimum acceptable international effort to protect the people of Darfur. Supports strengthening the African Union (AU) peacekeeping mission in Sudan. Calls upon the government of Sudan to: (1) allow implementation of the U.N. support packages as provided for in the Addis Ababa Agreement; and (B) work with the United Nations and the international community to deploy U.N. peacekeepers to Darfur. Calls upon all parties to the conflict to: (1) adhere to the 2004 N'Djamena ceasefire; and (2) respect the neutrality of humanitarian agencies so that relief workers can have access to their beneficiary populations. Urges the President to: (1) continue to work with the international community, including the permanent members of the Security Council, the AU, the European Union (EU), the Arab League, Sudan's trading partners, and the government of Sudan to facilitate deployment of the U.N. peacekeeping force; (2) ensure the ability of any Darfur peacekeeping force to carry out its mandate by providing adequate funding and working with our international partners to provide technical assistance, logistical support, intelligence gathering capabilities, and military assets; (3) work with Security Council members and the international community to develop and impose economic and diplomatic sanctions against the government of Sudan should such government continue to refuse to cooperate with implementation of Resolution 1706 and the Addis Ababa Agreement; and (4) work with Security Council members and the international community to address insecurity in Chad and the Central African Republic."
