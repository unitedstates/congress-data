Supports the holding of the second round of parliamentary elections as soon as possible while stressing the importance of a free and open process. Expresses thanks to the countries that have contributed personnel to the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), particularly Brazil. Encourages MINUSTAH to maintain current troop levels and to raise the numbers of UNPOL police forces. Urges the international community to continue to support MINUSTAH, fulfill previous 2004 donor pledges, and plan for a new multi-year commitment of support. Recommends: (1) the creation of an effective demobilization, disarmament, and reintegration program to encompass former military members and gangs; and (2) that the new government cooperate fully with MINUSTAH in assuring police and judiciary reform. Supports U.S. reconstruction assistance for Haiti."
