Urges such parties at the 2007 United States-European Union Summit to agree to a target date of 2015 for completing the transatlantic market and a study of existing obstacles to creating a transatlantic market that includes estimates of the costs of existing barriers to trade and investment and a timetable for removing those barriers."
