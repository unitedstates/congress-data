Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President and the President's representatives should: (1) raise concerns at the highest levels with the government of Afghanistan regarding the violations of internationally recognized human rights, including the right to freedom of religion or belief; and (2) ensure that the International Religious Freedom Report 2006 for Afghanistan fully addresses the issue of religious persecution in that country, including the arrest of Abdul Rahman."
