Urges the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to develop and implement Holocaust education programs as part of an effort against anti-Semitism and racial, religious, and ethnic intolerance. Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the President should direct the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations to continue working toward further reduction of anti-Semitic language and anti-Israel resolutions; (2) the President should direct the Secretary of State to report on acts of anti-Semitism at the United Nations and its agencies by member states; and (3) projects funded through the Middle East Partnership Initiative and U.S. overseas broadcasts should include efforts to educate Arab and Muslim countries about anti-Semitism, religious intolerance, and incitement to violence."
