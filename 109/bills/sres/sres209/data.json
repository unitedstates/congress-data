Allows a Senator to raise a single point of order that several provisions of a bill, resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report violate this Act. Sets forth procedures for consideration of certain points of order. Requires: (1) this Act to be waived or suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths (60) of the Members, duly chosen and sworn; and (2) the same three-fifths affirmative vote to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under this resolution."
