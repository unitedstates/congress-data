Directs CFIUS to: (1) withdraw its statement of no objection related to the purchase; and (2) conduct a 45-day investigation, pursuant to the Defense Production Act of 1950, in order to ensure that the purchase will not have an adverse effect on U.S. national security. Directs CFIUS to brief Members of Congress on the findings of its investigation before the purchase is allowed to proceed."
