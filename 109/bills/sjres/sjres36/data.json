Security Council, to reach a political agreement for Iraq that addresses fundamental issues including federalism, oil revenues, militias, security guarantees, reconstruction, economic assistance, and border security; and (5) the United States should maintain an over-the-horizon military presence to prosecute the war on terror and protect regional security interests."
