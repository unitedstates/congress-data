    "date": "2005-04-27", 
    "text": "Amends rule XI (Procedures of Committees and Unfinished Business) of the Rules of the House of Representatives to revise the procedures of the Committee on Standards of Official conduct to reinstate the requirement that the chairman and ranking minority member establish jointly an investigative subcommittee for consideration of a complaint if it is not disposed of within 45 days (or a 45-day extension). Allows establishment of an investigative subcommittee at any time during such applicable period if either the chairman or the ranking minority member has placed on the agenda the issue of whether to establish such a subcommittee. Requires an affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Committee to establish the subcommittee. Repeals the requirement that a complaint be dismissed if an investigative subcommittee has not been established within such applicable period after the complaint is filed (Automatic Dismissal Rule). Repeals the requirement that the Committee adopt rules providing that: (1) whenever notification of the Committee's decision to either dismiss a complaint or to create an investigative subcommittee is transmitted to a respondent, the individual shall have seven calendar days to submit his or her views in writing; or (2) if the notification references the conduct of another Member other than the respondent, such individual shall be notified and given seven calendar days to submit his or her views in writing (which shall be appended to the notice and made part of the record), or to request in writing that the Committee establish an adjudicatory subcommittee as if the notice constituted an adopted statement of alleged violation (in which case the Committee shall establish an adjudicatory subcommittee). Repeals the mandate that: (1) a respondent be informed of the right to be represented by counsel of his or her choice (even if such counsel represents another respondent or a witness) to be provided at his or her own expense; and (2) a witness be afforded a reasonable period of time, as determined by the Committee or subcommittee to prepare for an appearance before an investigative subcommittee or for an adjudicatory hearing and to obtain counsel of his or her choice, even if such counsel represents a respondent or another witness. (Thus allows the Committee to adopt a rule that prohibits a counsel from representing more than one respondent or witness). Requires an investigative subcommittee, when it does not adopt a statement of alleged violation, to transmit a report to that effect to the Committee in lieu of the respondent. Authorizes the Committee by an affirmative vote of a majority of its members to transmit such report to the House."
