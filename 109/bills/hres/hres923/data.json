Security Council and all civilized nations to: (1) condemn and reject policies aimed at destroying Israel; and (2) deny Hezbollah, and any nation or organization, the means to carry out its threats against Israel. Reaffirms the unwavering alliance between the United States and Israel and reasserts the U.S. commitment to defend Israel's right to exist as a free and democratic state."
