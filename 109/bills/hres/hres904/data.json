    "text": "Commends the American press for its long history of keeping the American public informed of its government's actions both at home and abroad. Repudiates censorship of the press and reaffirms that a vital characteristic of any democratic society is a free press. Finds that the press helps to educate the American people and provides all Americans a vital means of understanding the actions of the Congress, the Administration, and the Supreme Court, in addition to reporting important state and local government actions. Condemns those regimes which censor the press. Praises the government of Iraq for its commitment to a free press as well as the brave Iraqi journalists who have put their lives at risk to institutionalize a free press in Iraq. Expects that all elected representatives of the American people hold true to their oath to defend the Constitution and not use the trust of their office to weaken the vital role of a free press."
