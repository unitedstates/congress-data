Makes it out of order as well to conclude a recorded vote on: (1) any economically significant legislation or major legislation or related amendment or conference report after 10 p.m. or before 9 a.m.; or (3) any major legislation or related amendment or conference report more than 30 minutes after the commencement of such recorded vote. Requires the applicability of any point of order set forth in this resolution to be determined on the basis of estimates made by the Committee on the Budget. Authorizes the Speaker to recognize the majority leader for the purpose of offering a motion to waive this clause on the grounds of national security, homeland security, or other emergency. Prohibits such waiver without two-thirds of the Members voting, a quorum being present, and agreeing to it. Amends rule XIII (Calendar and Committee Reports) to prohibit the Committee on Rules from reporting a rule or order proposing a waiver of this resolution."
