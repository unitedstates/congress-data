Expresses condolences to the people of Hungary for those who lost their lives fighting for Hungarian freedom in 1956, as well as for those subsequently executed by the Soviet and Hungarian communist authorities, including Prime Minister Imre Nagy. Welcomes the changes that have taken place in Hungary since 1989, believing that Hungary's integration into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU), together with similar developments in the neighboring countries, will ensure peace and understanding among the peoples of the Carpathian Basin. Reaffirms the friendship between the governments of Hungary and the United States and between the Hungarian and American people."
