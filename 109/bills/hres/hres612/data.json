Acknowledges the Iraqi December 15, 2005, election as a crucial victory for its new democracy. Encourages Americans to express solidarity with the Iraq people and their goal of a democratic society. Honors the sacrifices made by the U.S. Armed Forces, their families, and members of the Iraq and Coalition forces. Expresses confidence that the U.S. Armed Forces, along with Iraqi and Coalition forces, will achieve victory in Iraq."
