Calls upon U.S. allies, the United Nations, and the international community to condemn Iran for the continuing imprisonment of Ali Akbar Ganji and other violations of internationally recognized human rights. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the government of Iran should end all acts of harassment and detention against peaceful Iranian dissidents and human rights defenders and conform with related international agreements and obligations; and (2) it should be U.S. policy to support human rights dissidents and pro-democracy advocates in Iran and promote the emergence of a peaceful democratic form of government in Iran."
