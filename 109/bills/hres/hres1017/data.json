    "text": "Commends: (1) the many Lebanese who continue to adhere to the principles of the Cedar Revolution; and (2) the democratically-elected government of Lebanon for its critical and courageous decision to deploy the Lebanese Armed Forces to the Lebanon-Israeli border. Affirms that the international community's intention, as expressed in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, is that the weapons flow to Hizballah should cease and that Hizballah should be disarmed. Calls on: (1) all countries, and particularly countries through which Iranian-supplied materiel passes en route from Iran to Hizballah, to take every possible measure to prevent the transfer of arms to Hizballah; (2) the international community to monitor Iranian and Syrian compliance with the arms embargo on Hizballah; and (3) Iran and Syria to cease supporting Hizballah with funds and arms. Condemns: (1) Syria's ongoing intimidation of Lebanon; and (2) the Syrian leader's claim that the deployment of international peace-keeping forces on the Lebanese-Syrian border would be \"hostile\" against Syria. Urges: (1) the government of Lebanon to request international assistance, including military deployment, on the Lebanese-Syrian border to prevent weapons resupply to Hizballah and to ensure full implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701; and (2) that such international assistance not impede commercial trade between civilians on both sides of the border. Believes that without international assistance on the Lebanese-Syrian border another Hizballah-provoked war will break out. Pledges support for the democratically-elected government of Lebanon and the Lebanese people against Syrian intimidation. Reaffirms support for Lebanon's independence and the full sovereignty of the government of Lebanon over Lebanese territory through the instrument of the Lebanese Armed Forces."
