Calls on the government of the United States to: (1) negotiate an agreement with the government of Egypt to establish a timetable for political and human rights reforms, such that the dimensions and direction of economic assistance to Egypt will depend upon meeting certain agreed upon benchmarks; and (2) offer direct assistance without prior government approval to Egyptian human rights and other civil society groups which seek to strengthen democratic principles and promote the rule of law."
